The pressure drop takes place across the rotor and represents the thrust T  Ap. Combining equations 4.2 and 4.3 we get the wellknown result;4.5we get that uR  (1  a)U0 and u1  (1  2a)U0. From equation 4.2 we get the following expressions for thrust and power extraction;This result, usually referred to as the Betz limit, states that the upper maximum for power extraction is 59.3 of the kinetic energy contained in a stream tube having the same cross section as the disc. However, it does not include the losses due to rotation of the wake and therefore it represents a conservative upper maximum.;The blade element momentum method was developed by Glauert (1935) as a practical way to analyze and design rotor blades. The basic idea behind the model is to combine axial and angular momentum balance with forces and moments determined from a blade element strip theory. Applying the axial momentum equation on a differential element, i.e. an annulus comprising two stream surfaces, we get
