4.31where the function f(rR) is a semiempirical function associated with the induction. The equation can be seen to correspond to the axial momentum equation 4.9, except for the time term that is responsible for the time delay.;To include a realistic wind input in the computations, it is important to simulate a time history of the wind field that mimics a correct spatial and temporal variation. A method for simulating the time history of the wind as it is seen by a rotating blade was developed by Veers (1988). In a later method by Mann (1998) cross correlation features are obeyed by using the linearized NavierStokes equations as basis for the model.;As a prestep to the BEM computations, 2D airfoil data have to be established from wind tunnel measurements or computations. For many years wind turbine blades were designed using welltested aviation airfoils, such as the NACA 44xx and the NACA 634xx airfoils, as wind turbine manufacturers traditionally were reluctant to change to other airfoil types because of the fear of unexpected stall behavior. However, since the beginning of the 1990s various tailormade airfoils have been designed for wind turbine rotors, e.g. Bjrk (1990), Tangler and Sommers (1995), Timmer and Rooij (2003), and Fuglsang and Bak (2004). In order to construct a set of airfoil data to be used for a rotating blade, the airfoil data further need to be corrected for 3D and rotational effects. Simple correction formulas for rotational effects have been proposed by Snel et al. (1993), Du and Selig (1998), Chaviaropoulos and Hansen (2000), and Bak et al. (2006) for incidences up to stall. As a simple engineering method, the following expression can be used to correct the lift data;4.32where a and b are constants, with a values in the range from 2 to 3 and b values in the range from 1 to 2. A similar expression can be used for the drag coefficient. For higher incidences (45), 2D lift and drag coefficients of a flat plate can be used. These data, however, are too big because of aspect ratio effects and here the correction formulas of Viterna and Corrigan (1981) are usually applied (see also Spera, 1994). In Hoerner (1965), it is stated that the normal coefficient is approximately constant for angles of attack between 45 and 90 and that the
