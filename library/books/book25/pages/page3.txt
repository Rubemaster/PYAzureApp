 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2011control volume. In BEM theory it is assumed, as an approximation, that the contribution from the pressure on the axial momentum is negligible, hence equation 4.11 is written as;4.13where u is the azimuthal velocity behind the rotor. Assuming that uR  (U0  u1) is valid also for a differential element and introducing the azimuthal interference factor as a  u(2r), where  denotes the angular velocity of the rotor, equations 4.12 and 4.13 read;4.17where B is the number of blades, c is the local chord length, Vrel is the relative flow velocity, as seen by the airfoil, Fn and Ft denote the loading on each blade in axial and tangential direction, respectively, and Cn and Ct denote the corresponding 2D force coefficients. The force coefficients are related to the lift and drag coefficients as follows;4.19where  denotes the angle between the rotor plane and the relative velocity (see Fig. 4.2). From the velocity triangle at the bladeelement, we deduce that
