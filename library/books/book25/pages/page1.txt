Alternatively, the BEM model may be replaced by NavierStokes computations. However, this type of computation still demands too much computing power to be a part of the design cycle. Aerodynamic modeling may also concern design of specific parts of wind turbines, such as rotor blade geometry or performance predictions of wind farms. In such a case, NavierStokes computations may be the only alternative that can provide sufficient detailed information.;We first discuss the simple axial momentum theory originated by Rankine (1865), W Froude (1878) and R E Froude (1889). Consider an axial flow of speed U0 past an actuator disk of area A with constant axial load (thrust) T. Let uR be the axial velocity in the rotor plane, u1 the axial velocity in the ultimate wake where the air has regained its undisturbed pressure value p1  p0 and let  denote the density of air. We now consider a onedimensional (1D) model for the stream tube that encloses the rotor disc (see Fig. 4.1), where A0 and A1 are the crosssectional areas of the wake far upstream and far downstream of the rotor, respectively. The equation of continuity requires that the rate of mass flow m. is constant in each cross section.;4.1 Control volume for onedimensional actuator disk.
