The correction is introduced by dividing the force coefficients in equations 4.21 and 4.22 by F. Different tip loss correction models have been developed to calculate load and power of wind turbines (de Vries, 1979). Recently, some of the existing tip loss correction models were analyzed by Shen et al. (2005a) who found an inconsistency in their basic form, which results in incorrect predictions of the aerodynamic behavior in the proximity of the tip. To remedy the inconsistency, a new tip loss correction model was proposed and tested in combination with both a standard BEM model (Shen et al., 2005a) and a NavierStokesbased actuator disc model (Shen et al., 2005b).;When the axial interference factor becomes greater than about 0.4 the rotor starts to run in the turbulent wake state and axial momentum theory is no longer valid (see e.g. Stoddard, 1977 or Srensen et al., 1998). In the turbulent wake state, a solution can be found by using an empirical relationship between the thrust coefficient and the axial interference factor. Different relations can be used (e.g. Spera, 1994 or Eggleston and Stoddard, 1987). Below we show the expression proposed by Spera (1994)
