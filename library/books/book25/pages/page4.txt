Inserting these expressions into equations 4.16 and 4.17, we get;Combining equations 4.144.15 with equations 4.234.24, we get;4.26where   Bc2r is the solidity of the rotor. To determine the flow conditions and loadings, these equations are solved at different radial cross sections along the blade. The equations are most efficiently solved as follows 1) Guess appropriate values for a and a 2) compute the flow angle from equation 4.20 and determine the angle of attack,     , where  is the local pitch angle (see Fig. 4.2) 3) determine the force coefficients from tabulated airfoil data 4) compute a and a from equations 4.25 and 4.26 and continue the iteration until convergence. Albeit simple to use, these equations are strictly speaking only valid for a rotor operating under steady axisymmetric flow conditions. In practice, they need to be adjusted to cope with realistic operational modes. In the following we will briefly go through the most relevant adjustments.;The BEM method is a 1D approach based on the actuator disc principle, which corresponds to a rotor with an infinite number of blades. To account for the difference in circulation between an Nbladed rotor and an actuator disc, a tip loss factor was derived by Prandtl (Betz, 1919) and introduced in the BEM technique by Glauert (1935). In Glauerts method a correction factor F is introduced as follows
