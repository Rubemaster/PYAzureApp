When the rotor disc is not aligned with the incoming wind, yaw misalignment appears and the induced velocity will be subject to an azimuth variation. In this case, the wake is not in line with the free wind direction and it is impossible to apply the usual control volume analysis. A way of solving the problem is to maintain the control volume and specify an azimuthdependent induction. In practice, it works by computing a mean induction and prescribing a function that gives the azimuthal dependency of the induction. The following simple formula has been proposed by Snel and Schepers (1995);4.30where wi0 is the annulusaveraged induced velocity and  is the wake skew angle, which is not identical to the yaw angle because the induced velocity in yaw alters the mean flow direction in the wake. In the notation used here, blade denotes the azimuthal position of the blade and 0 is the azimuthal position where the blade is deepest in the wake.;Dynamic wake or dynamic inflow refers to unsteady flow phenomena that affect the loading on the rotor. In a real flow situation, the rotor is subject to unsteadiness from coherent wind gusts, yaw misalignment and control actions, such as pitching and yawing. When the flow changes in time the wake is subject to a time delay when going from one equilibrium state to another. An initial change creates a change in the distribution of trailing vorticity which then is convected downstream and first can be felt in the induced velocities after some time. However, the BEM method in its simple form is basically steady hence unsteady effects have to be included as an addon. In the European CEC Joule II project Dynamic Inflow Yawed Conditions and Partial Span Pitch (see Schepers and Snel, 1995) various dynamic inflow models were developed and tested. Essentially a dynamic inflow model predicts the time delay through an exponential decay with a time constant
