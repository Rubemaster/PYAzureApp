To quantify the structure of the flow field the azimuthally and timeaveraged axial velocities in the wake behind the three rotors are computed, and the outcome is shown in Figure 4.3, which depicts the velocity profiles for various downstream sections. The profiles in the wake of the most upstream turbine are nearly constant over most of the radial distance, i.e. from rR  0.3 to rR  1.0, which is indicative of the wake being dominated by the induction of distinct root and tip vortices. At the downstream position of the second rotor (zR  6) the presence of two systems of tip vortices originating from respectively the first and the second turbine is clearly observed in the velocity profile, which is consistent with the contour plot in Plate II. In between the second and the third rotor the wake deficit is observed to develop towards a bellshaped profile, indicating that the wake is undergoing a transition from a flow field described by organized vortex structures to a flow field that is dominated by small scale turbulence. From theoretical considerations, it is known that the axial velocity in the far field of a turbulent wake is described by a Gaussian distribution. The flow field is redistributed as it passes through the third rotor, but the strong unsteady mixing causes the deficit to develop rapidly back to the bellshaped form.
