Denmark The Poul La Cour Wind Tunnel inaugurated in August 2018 offers tests combining Reynolds Number and acoustic properties. Innovative aerodynamic blades profiles are also tested.;Italy CNRINM hosts a wave tank and circulating water channel, which allows testing of modelscale offshore wind turbines installed on a floating platform in a controlled environment. POLIWind wind tunnel includes actively controlled and aeroelastically scaled wind turbine models for the simulation of wind farms and the study of wake interactions.;Greece FloatMAst Blue floating Tension Leg Platform (TLP) features a Lidar system and a 40m mast and provides high accuracy wind speed and regime measurements. The prototype platform is currently deployed in the Aegean Sea.;Ireland Two new meteorological Lidars were installed in 2017. UCCHMRC Wave test tank.;Denmark Four new test sites added at Hvsre and sterild. Turbines as tall as 330 m may be tested in sterild.;Ireland The Galway Bay Marine and Renewable Energy Test Site will engage in marine energy research include floating offshore wind. It will test BluWind, a Floating Wind 16 Scale Prototype Demonstrator. SEAI AMETS full scale floating test site in consenting with planned test of SAIPEM Hexafloat in EU AFLOWT project.;United Kingdom A demonstration wind farm was commissioned by EDF, featuring five MHI Vestas V164 8.3MW turbines mounted on floatandsink gravitybased foundations at the Blyth Offshore Demonstration site.;United States Maine Aqua Ventus I and Central Maine Power Company signed a 20year power purchase agreement for a DOEfunded offshore wind demonstration project, allowing the project to sell its electricity to the utility. NREL and Avangrid demonstrated wind energys ability to maintain grid reliability and frequency regulation services at a California commercial wind plant.
