Figure 9. Landbased wind power project cost history from reporting IEA Wind TCP countries.;Austria Belgium Canada China Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Japan Mexico Netherlands Norway Portugal Spain Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom United Statesdecreased from close to 70 EURMWh (July 2018) to 56 EURMWhthis is lower than the wholesale price of electricity in Greece. In the technology neutral auctions in Italy in 2020, wind was winning 87 of 1 GW. In Ireland, the first auction of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme was held in 2020 with wind energy projects totalling 479 MW (1.5 TWha) awarded contracts.;The success of cost reductions has also brought about corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) building wind power outside the subsidy schemes. This hasbeen used in the US already for years, and in Europe, growing steadily since 2015. 2020 was a record year for corporate renewable PPAs as 3.7 GW were contracted in the EU 22 new PPAs signed in 9 countries with wind farms for a total of 1.9 GW. In Finland, all 300 MW of new capacity was without subsidy, second year in a row.;Figure 8.
