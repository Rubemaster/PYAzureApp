While the wind industry has already made progress digitalizing specific segments of the wind plant life cycle, much remains to be done to increase digitalization momentum. This includes developing a holistic view and identifying wider opportunities to reduce lifecycle costs, expedite, deploy, enhance performance of assets, and integrate wind energy effectively into evolving energy grids and markets.;The scope of the Task includes digitization topics across the following dimensions  Lifecycle stages.  Value chain components.  Interaction between and across lifecycle and value chain players.;The purpose is to coordinate research and development activities, from data and analytics to connectivity across the global wind industry, and to recommend best practices which maximize benefits from digitalization while minimizing duplicate or inefficient effort. This will be achieved by convening an international expert body that will  Define what is meant by wind energy digitalization  Describe the current state of digitalization capability and practice within the wind energy sector  Identify and prioritize valueadd opportunities enabled by further digitalization  Develop recommended digitalization practices for the wind energy sector.;Since the topic of digitalization is quite broad, the task has broken up into several work packages. Now, the teams are working in parallel on both the technical issues and on the crosscutting topics. Additionally, based on the outcomes of a number of interviews with external experts from research and industry and on the results of the technical discussions, Task 43 strives to develop a roadmap for digitalization in wind energy.
