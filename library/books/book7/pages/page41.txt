In 2009, Italy set a binding national target of 17 of overall annual energy consumption from renewable energy sources (RES) in 2020, which included a target of 12.68 GW (12.0 GW landbased and 0.680 GW;OPENING PHOTO BLADE TRANSPORT WITH INNOVATIVE BLADE LIFTER SYSTEM THROUGH A SMALL VILLAGE IN LIGURIAN REGION TO THE SITE OF INSTALLATION OF ROCCHE BIANCHE WIND PLANT .(CREDITS PHOTOGRAPH MARCO RIMONDI AND COPYRIGHT FERA SRL, WWW.FERASRL.IT );In 2020 Italy was one of the first countries strongly affected by the COVID pandemic and consequent lockdowns. This caused delays in all the sectors, including wind park installations and wind energy related research activities. The new yearly power capacity, around 100 MW, represents the minimum value in the last fifteen years. However, three joint PV wind tenders to access the incentives took place and wind farms won 87 of the whole 1 GW capacity. The renewable penetration registered very relevant peaks.;LUCA GRECO, National Research Council, CNR, Italy LAURA SERRI, Ricerca sul Sistema Energetico, RSE S.p.A., Italy.;The total number of wind turbines was 2526, an increase of 116 in 2020.

The amount of wind capacity installed in 2020 was 1.9 times that of 2019, which is the largest new singleyear installationamount ever. The launch of several largescale projects has contributed to this. The national capacity factor (average national capacity factor) was 20.8, and the ratio of wind power to total electricity supply and demand in Japan was 0.89 (7.64857.8 TWh). In research and development, in order to promote offshore wind power, the New Energy and Industrial;FLOATING FORM WIND TURBINE HIBIKI MANUFACTURED BY HITACHI ZOSEN CO., LTD., INSTALLED 15 KILOMETERS OFFSHORE OF KITAKYUSHU CITY.;At the end of 2020, Japans wind power capacity reached 4,439 MW (of which 57.6 MW is offshore wind). Most of the wind power installed in Japan is onshore wind power.;n 2017, the renewable energy target was raised to 20 of the electricity generation by 2030. In October 2020, president Moon Jaein announcedthat the Republic of Korea aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The wind energy sector in Korea, which has shown slower deployment than the photovoltaics, is preparing largescale installation of wind energy, especially in offshore wind for the energy transition.;SOUTHWEST OFFSHORE WIND FARM, JELLABUKDO, KOREA, DOOSAN HEAVY INDUSTRY 3 MW WTGS, SOURCE KOREA OFFSHORE WIND POWER CO., LTD.;Having installed 191 MW capacity of wind turbines in 2019 and 160 MW in 2020, the accumulated capacity in Korea reached 1650 MW at the end of 2020. A 60 MW offshore windfarm was constructed in 2020 resulting in 132 MW offshore wind power capacity in Korea.;ind power in Norway continued with a high level of deployment and increased by 1532 MW in 2020, resulting in a net totalinstalled capacity of 3,977 MW at the end of the year. The production of windbased electrical energy in 2020 was 9.9 TWh, an increase of 80 from the year before. Decreasing LCOE for wind power projects and the end of the electricity certificate scheme drives the high level of wind power deployment in Norway in recent years.;Wind power in Norway continued with a high level of deployment and increased by 1532 MW in 2020, resulting in a net total installed capacity of 3,977 MW at the end of the year.

SOURCE AGRARMOTIVE  STOCK.ADOBE;Wind energy plays an important role for the successful energy transition to renewable energies in Germany. In 2020 wind energy had the biggest contribution to power generation from renewables. With an amount of 131 TWh electricity from wind power has reached an alltime record (126 TWh in 2019). Special attention should be drawn to February 2020, where more than 20 TWh of wind energy power have been generated, what excels the previous record from March 2019 (15,5 TWh). 6;he implementation of the Climate Action Plan measures to achieve ambitious 2030 targets ramped up, including measures facilitating theoffshore wind sector. The new Government brought increased climate and renewable energy ambitions, particularly for offshore wind.;s a result of a decision to speed up the switch to carbon free system, significant installed capacity of lignite plants was shut down,resulting in a drastic reduction of lignite share in electricity production (12.1 compared to 18 in 2019). Although natural gas remains the main energy source for the Greek electricity grid, RES is steadily increasing its share on track to become the major component by 2030.;The previous year, wind energy in Greece continued its dynamic expansion with annual new installations exceeding longterm average. 525 MW of new wind farms were completed and connected to the grid in 2020 corresponding to a 13 increase in installed wind capacity.;As per estimates, India has a wind potential of more than 695.50 GW at a hub height of 120 metres, and the country currently has the fourthhighest wind installed capacity in the world with total installed capacity of 38.62 GW as on 31 December, 2020 and 60.42 billion units were generated from wind power during the year 2020.;DR.

In the next four years, new policies will support an accelerated transition towards thegeneration, transmission and use of renewable and clean energy, as long as social inclusion is contemplated 3. Three auctions performed so far resulted in 3,407 MW of wind power contracted these projects should be installed before 2021.;In 2020, the wind power sector in Mexico had added 574 MW of new wind power to the national electricity grid, bringing the total capacity to 6,681 MW 1. The growth rate for annual additions was 9 with respect to 2019, and representing about 8.6 of total installed capacity 1.
