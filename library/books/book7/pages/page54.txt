Germany The HAPT project ((Highly Accelerated Pitch bearing Test) aimed at increasing the reliability of rotor blade bearings and facilitating the application of new bearingrelated technologies for wind turbines of up to 10 MW rated power. For the application of the test strategies, a full scale test rig was designed and manufactured. In the followup project HAPT 2 the application of roller bearings as pitch bearings is investigated by examining characteristics, especially damage mechanisms, of this bearing for oscillating movement and by developing and comparing simulation models with experimental data. That shall allow to design and validate roller bearings as pitch bearings.;Greece The GREEN ISLAND demonstration project, Agios Efstratios, aims at transforming a small isolated island grid into a RES powered system The system will include800900kW wind turbine and 100200 kW PV array supported by a 2.5 MWh LiIon battery and thermal storage for load balancing and medium term storage.;Ireland Eirgrid, the Irish TSO, completed trials in 2017 to verify the capabilities of powergeneration and other technologies to provide newly defined system services. The wind power plant qualified to provide Fast Frequency Response (FFR) Primary Operating Reserve (POR) Secondary Operating Reserve (SOR) Tertiary Operating Reserve 1 (TOR1) Fast Post Fault Active Power Recovery (FPFAPR) Steady State Reactive Power (SSRP) and Dynamic Reactive Response (DRR).;Korea A blade test laboratory, Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMSWTRC), was recognised as RE Testing Laboratories of IECRE in 2019. It can accommodate and test 7MW blade the facility is 203 m long and 26 m tall, and is equipped with static and fatigue test equipment for blades.;Switzerland Airborne wind energy is prioritized in Switzerland with a successful test flight of a TwingTec prototype T28 in Chasseral in 2018. The T29, with a rated power of 10 kW, was continuously tested in 2019. A demonstration project is being prepared by TwingTec and Skypull as a followup.;More comprehensive data on test facilities can be found in the US DOEs Wind Energy Facilities Book 2017 and at Catalogue of Facilities Available, published by EU FP7project IRPWIND (www.irpwind.eupublicationsdeliverable)
