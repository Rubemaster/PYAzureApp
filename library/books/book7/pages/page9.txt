Cost reductions from auctions leading to increasing subsidy free projects The wind power industry continues to improve its competitiveness. In Norway, the LCOE of wind energy in 2019 was on average record low at 28 EURMWh. The average costs of landbased projects reported from seven member countries were 1,097 EURkW (1,342 USDkW) in 2020 (Figure 9 and Appendix Table;9). Project costs have decreased by 41 since their peak in 2011 (inflationcorrected). See also Task 26 Cost of Wind Energy.;Figure 5.

Average size of newly installed offshore wind turbines.;2020. The average installed capacity of new turbines surpassed 3 MW in member countries reporting. For offshore, 7 to 8 MW turbines are increasingly used.;Table 2 shows wind power capacity rankings for size of new and total capacity for reporting countries. The rated capacity of new turbines in member countries reporting shows an increasing trend (Figure 6, see also Sweden chapter for rotor diameter and rated capacity trends).;In Finland, the average size of new landbased turbines in 2020 surpassed 4.5 MW, with Norway, Denmark and Sweden also holding an average size of close to 4 MW or more. In Europe, the average size was 3.3 MW.;Offshore turbine sizes are increasing even more the Netherlands reported more than 9 MW average size in 2020, Belgium 8.7 MW, Portugal 8.4 MW, and UK 7 MW. (Appendix Table 8). According to country reports, the average size for newly installed offshore turbines was 7 MW, up from 6.6 MW in 2019 (in Europe 8.2 MW, up from 7.2 MW in 2019).;Figure 5.
