(nosubsidy merchant projects). The average bids accepted were 39 GBPMWh (in 2019 40.63 GBP MWh, 46.16 EURMWh) including gridconnection. In Germany and the Netherlands, offshore bids have already been awarded at zero premium (over and above the wholesale electricity price, excluding grid connection).;An increasing proportion of installed capacity will reach its end of life between 2020 and 2030. To address this challenge, the IEA Wind TCP started a new Task 42 on Lifetime extension in 2019.;For example, more than 30 of Denmarks installed capacity will be more than 20 years old in 2020. Spain is anticipating 1015 GW of repowering in the next decade.;Italy and Portugal report repowering as a way to meet future targets for wind energy. In Italy, repowering is included in the auctioning system.;Out of the 14.7 GW of onshore wind installed in 2020 in Europe, only 345 MW were through repowering projects. The majority came from Germany, but there was also repowering activity in Greece, Luxembourg, and the UK. Complex permitting rules have been the main reason for the slow uptake of repowering projects in Europe.
