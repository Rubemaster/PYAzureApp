NREL. It provides simulations of wind turbines and power plants to enable engineers to test designs in real time, minimizing industry risk and ensuring optimized performance. DOEs Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed a wind power plant modelling framework that is the first to simulate plant performance under complex atmospheric conditions.; The Danish Power Pack WindHybrid installation generator for offshore wind turbines demonstrated a hybrid generator unit that can supply offshore wind turbines with energy during periods when they are off grid. In collaboration with rsted AS, the project developed a wind turbine integrated supply unit and backup unit for the entire life of the turbine.; In the German VISSKA project, the innovative installation method vibratory pile driving is assessed and verified as a potential lownoise and sustainable alternative to impact hammering with respect to duration and underwater noise emission. Measurements are conducted during the installation of the offshore wind farm KASKASI II in the German North Sea. The development and validation of prediction models for installation and noise emission as well as the investigation of the reaction of harbour porpoises to continuous noise shall promote the transfer of the innovative installation method to a stateoftheart installation method.; The research programme Vindval finances four projects on regional and national planning of wind power in Sweden and management of conflict of interests. These projects develop methods for finding good locations for wind power both onshore and offshore that minimize negative impacts on humans, animals, and nature. They address the challenge of the planning stage for a large deployment of sustainable wind power in Sweden.
