Spatial planning limitations and lack of sufficient eligible wind zones are reported from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. In Finland, more state lands are being offered for wind power plants. Distance regulations, height limits near airports, and turbine lighting have been reported as barriers, and updates to regulations are seen in many countries to mitigate these and allow for larger turbine sizes. In France, propositions for reducing lighting and signalling of wind turbines were announced in 2020. Restrictions related to the defence sector may conflict with wind deployment, mainly due to interference with communications, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) systems. Mitigation solutions are being developed from radar interference research in Switzerland and Germany and the US.;In Germany, the decreasing deployment trend has been attributed to a gap in subsidy schemes for offshore wind as well as a massive curtailment in availability ofspace in individual onshore regions due to regulations by the federal state administrations. Protection of species, air traffic control, weather radar or military issues also impact availability of sites. To counteract these inhibiting issues, shortened permission procedures and support of repowering projects have been set up. To achieve future targets, higher tender volumes including financial participation of communities, system and market integration as well as measures for social acceptance are important elements of the new law EEG 2021.;In Switzerland, the renewable targets were adapted to a more local level by declaring that interests of the state should be taken into consideration in the wind project planning process locally. Combined procedure for land use planning and build permitting has been opened in some Cantons (provinces), with first wind farm projects following the new simplified process in 2021.
