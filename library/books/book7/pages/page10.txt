Average wind power output (capacity factor) by country for offshore and landbased wind power generation. These figures have estimated data for 201720 for the countries that do not report the capacity factors total wind generation in 2020 divided by the average installed capacity beginning of year and end of year.;2017, when Mexico and Canada reached record low prices of 14.2 EURMWh (16.3 USDMWh) and 23 EUR MWh (26 USDMWh) respectively. In Germany the record low bid of 2017 has been 22 EURMWh (25 USD MWh). In 2019, Finnish technology neutral tender (1.4 TWha) winners were all wind power plants with average subsidy of 2.5 EURMWh EURMWh, payable only when the spot price is less than 30 EURMWh.;In 2020, 8 GW of wind power capacity was secured in auctions in EU, mainly for landbased wind energy. The Spanish auction saw wind farms secure 1 GW with bids being record low, below 30 EURMWh (36.7 USD MWh). In France, three onshore wind tenders were made in 2020 for a total of 1.38 GW. The average prices have decreased from 65.4 EURMWh (2017) to 59.7 EURMWh (July 2020). In Greece, the auction prices
