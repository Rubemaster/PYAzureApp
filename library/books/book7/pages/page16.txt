Allowing wind power plants to access markets for grid support will provide revenue for wind power plants and help the balancing task of system operators. This is increasingly happening in Europe and the US. For example, in Spain, 16.7 GW of the total of 27.4 GW wind power capacity installed had successfully passed the Operational Capability Tests at the end of 2020.;In the US, battery storage additions to wind power plants is a trend. There is increasing interest in hybrid solutions combining wind and solar with storage, also in other countries. In India, 2,550 MW capacity of transmissionconnected windsolar hybrid projects have been awarded in three auctions since the system was launched in 2018. In Greece, legislative framework for hybrids is gradually taking shape, with expected activity in near future.;In China, a series of policies and regulations to reduce wind curtailment, in addition to large transmission upgrades, have been successful in reducing the curtailed energy to less than 17 TWh (less than 4) in 2020, compared to 41.9 TWh (more than 10) in 2018.;In Europe, the curtailments in several countries have an increasing trend, as the shares of wind increase. Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and UK report curtailments in the range of 2.5 to 11 .;At the same time, system operators in several countries have been achieving high instantaneous shares of wind without technical problems, and introducing new measures to reduce curtailments. In Ireland, Denmark, and Spain, the wind power plants are providing balancing energy by controlled curtailing which is a marketbased use of flexibility of wind power.
