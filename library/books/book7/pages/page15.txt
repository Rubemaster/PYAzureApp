Incentivising wind power investment has been a major tool used to improve deployment. Table 10 provides an overview of the subsidy systems and other tools employed by member countries to increase wind power deployment. In 2020, the US PTC was extended at 14.7 EURMWh until the end of 2021, and investment credits;Incentivising wind power investment has been a major tool used to improve deployment. Table 10 provides an overview of the subsidy systems and other tools employed by member countries to increase wind power deployment. In 2020, the US PTC was extended at 14.7 EURMWh until the end of 2021, and investment creditsare applied to offshore and distributed wind. In Norway and Sweden, green certificates have been extended until end of 2021, and in China, landbased wind power subsidies ended in 2020, but offshore is still subsidized until the end of 2021. Austria, Italy, and Japan have been lowering their subsidy levels of feedintariffs (FITs). Korea has a technologyneutral and market based RPS system.;Stimulating industrial consumers to procure their energy needs directly from wind energy through power purchase agreements (PPAs) is one way of securing longterm income for wind power producersthis is also important for lowering the costofdebt financing. US and Europe have seen a steady growth of PPAs. In Korea, PPAs were allowed in 2020 for renewable energy directly with loads, however, there are still practical issues to be solved as need large stable loads to be able to make a PPA contract.;In 2020, low market prices were seen and also negative prices for the first time in Finland and Sweden. Building energy markets that support the longterm sustainability of wind deployment will be important. Electrification and energy system coupling with
