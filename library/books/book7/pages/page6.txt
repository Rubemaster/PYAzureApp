 In Korea, licenses for electricity business offshore totalled 4.7 GW wind projects at 33 locations end of 2020.;Plans for energy islands were advancing in 2020 as Denmark reserved areas for one energy island in the North Sea and one in the Baltic Sea. The energy islands will be hubs that can improve the connection between energy from offshore wind and the energy systems in the region. Cooperation on energy islands with Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands has been declared, fulfilling the political wish of the energy islands being connected to several countries.;Wind power continues to steadily increase its share of the electricity mix. In 2020, wind produced an average of 8 of the electricity demand in member countriesup from 7 in 2019 (Figure 3). Windgenerated electricity met more than 6 of the worlds demand in 2020 2.;In Finland, renewables generated more electricity than other generators. In Spain, wind generation was second largest source of energy, and in UK renewable energy outpaced fossil fuel generation for the first time.; Seven countries now meet more than 20 of their electricity demand with wind power, and eleven countries meet more than 10. The EU is at 15 share of its electricity demand with 14 of the 27 Member States having wind shares above 10.; The highest share was in Denmark where 47 of the electricity demand in 2020 was met by wind energy, followed by Ireland at 36, Portugal at 25 and Germany at 24. Denmark and Portugal report instant shares of more than 100 of wind during one hour.; In 2020, UK and Sweden passed the 20 landmark while the Netherlands made a leap from less than 9 share in 2019 to almost 14 share in 2020. Finland and the US were close to the 10 landmark.;FIGURE 3.
