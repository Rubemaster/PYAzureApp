Some delays due to pandemic were reported from EU (Italy, Sweden, and UK). Even the countries that reported slow growth show anticipation of more deployment after 2020. See Appendix Table 4 for additions in 2020 and Table 5 for anticipated buildout.; New records in annual installations were made in China (54,5 GW), the US (16,8 GW), the Netherlands (2.2 GW), Norway (1.5 GW), Sweden (1.4 GW), Belgium (0.8 GW), and Japan (0.5 GW). Spain, Germany, India, and France installed more than 1 GW each. China installed 56 of the global wind energy market (more than 40 in 2019), followed by the United States (18), and the NL (2).; China, the United States, and Germany continue to lead in cumulative wind capacity. China is at 290,7 GW (of which 281 GW is grid connected), Europe at 220 GW (EU27 180 GW) and the US at 122 GW. As Sweden passed the 10 GW landmark in 2020, now eleven countries have 10 GW or more of installed wind power capacity (ten IEA Wind TCP members plus Brazil).;Offshore wind power installations made a new record of 7 GW in 2020, adding 17 more than in 2019,representing 9 of the annual global market (more than 20 of the European market). The cumulative capacity totalled 36 GW (Figure 2).;China, the Netherlands, and Belgium led new offshore installations with new records achieved in 2020 3,85 GW, 1.5 GW, and 0.7 GW, respectively. UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium installed more offshore than onshore capacity in 2019.;China overtook UK as the leader in cumulative offshore capacity in 2020, with approximately 11 GW installed. Six countries have more than 1 GW of offshore wind.;The first threeturbine floating wind farm was commissioned at the Windfloat Atlantic offshore floating wind farm in Portugal, using V1648.4 MW turbines. The UK has a 10 GW floating wind power target in addition to the 30 GW offshore wind in 2030, with separate auctions planned.;China will see a huge increase of offshore capacity this year, to benefit the last year of its subsidy scheme. Offshore projects under construction are reported from the UK, the NL, Denmark, and finally also France, where the startup of construction of 3 of the 6 awarded offshore wind farms from Round 1 and 2 tenders. In Italy, the first offshore wind power plant is being built (10x3 MW).; In the US, there were 15 active leases and 25.5 GW offshore wind in various stages of development off the East Coast and in the Great Lakes regions.;Plans for energy islands were advancing in 2020 as Denmark reserved areas for one energy island in the North Sea and one in the Baltic Sea. The energy islands will be hubs that can improve the connection between energy from offshore wind and the energy systems in the region. Cooperation on energy islands with Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands has been declared, fulfilling the political wish of the energy islands being connected to several countries.;Figure 2.
