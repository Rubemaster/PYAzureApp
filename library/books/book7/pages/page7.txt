Policy targets will double the wind capacity by 2030 Most policy targets are set for renewables and not for wind specifically. However, 13 of the member countries had set windspecific targets for year 2020often not as official targets, but as an estimate of how much wind would contribute to the renewable targets. On average, a 95 fulfilment of targets is seen (Figure 4). Austria and Spain would have reached the original target, but the Figure shows a drop of achievement due to increased targets in recent years. Italy fell 1 GW short of the capacity targets but achieved the renewables target as share of electricity. The Netherlands estimates the 6 GW land base wind target to be fulfilled in 2023.;Year 2020 continued to see important carbon neutrality targets announced globally the US, Canada, Japan and Korea joined Europe in targeting net zero in 2050. In Europe, Germany announced striving for greenhouse gas neutrality already in 2045complementing previous announcements from Austria (by 2040), Finland (by 2035), and Sweden (by 2045). In China, the net zero target for 2060 was announced together with a target to turn coal generation to downward trend by 2030.;In Europe, the 2030 targets (32 RES share of final energy consumption, 50 of electricity demand) are currently reviewed, aiming at a 55 GHG reductiontarget by 2030fit for 55. The European Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy published in 2020 aims at increasing offshore wind capacity, including floating wind, from its current level of 12 GW to at least 60 GW by 2030 and to 300 GW by 2050. Several member countries include wind specific targets in their National Energy and Climate Plans (NECP) for 2030. The targets will double the current landbased wind capacity in 2030 for Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. For Denmark, France and Ireland, doubling the landbased wind power is matched with an even higher target for offshore. The offshore wind targets in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands equal a fourfold increase. In Germany, the new target 20 GW is more than double the current offshore capacity, with target for 2040 (40 GW) again doubling the offshore wind capacity.;Korea target for 20 renewable electricity in 2030 means 17.7 GW wind capacity, including 12 GW offshoreambitious increase from the current 1.5 GW landbased and 0.1 GW offshore installed.;The current national targets established by IEA Wind TCP member governments for renewable energy and wind energy are listed at the end of this chapter in Table 7. The goals represent a powerful driving force for renewables, particularly wind energy.;FIGURE 4.
