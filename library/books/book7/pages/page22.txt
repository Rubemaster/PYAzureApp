IEA WINDand to demonstrate installation in different types of seabeds. The project showed that the modular suction bucket could contribute to a cheaper production of foundations, cheaper transport, and a more efficient and simplified logistics around assembling the bucket structure on the quay.; The Dutch Tetrahedron crane can lift an extra 50 metres over the classical cranes on the same vessel while lifting performance is preserved. Existing crane vessels can be upgraded with the Tetrahedron crane.; The British Leading Edge for Turbines (LEFT) transferred rotor blade leading edge protection technology from the helicopter to the wind industry. The technology demonstrated extremely high erosion resistance and potential to unlock far higherblade tip speeds, whilst providing lifetime leading edge protection. Demonstration and modelling showed the shields could survive extreme design load cases.; In Sweden, the project Chemical recycling of glass fibre composite from wind turbine blades is investigating the possibility of chemically recycling the composite in the wind turbine blades with solvolysHTL. The thermoset is converted into chemical building blocks that can be used for plastics, chemicals, vehicle fuels, and the fiberglass fractions can be reused in new composites.; The German project SeeOff focuses on cost efficient and environmentally friendly decommissioning of offshore wind farms. The project facilitates how stakeholders develop and assess efficient, project specific decommissioning strategies which are cost minimizing, comply with legal requirements, ensure safety at work and environmental protection, and are publicly accepted.
