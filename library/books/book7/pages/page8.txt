Table 2 shows wind power capacity rankings for size of new and total capacity for reporting countries. The rated capacity of new turbines in member countries reporting shows an increasing trend (Figure 6, see also Sweden chapter for rotor diameter and rated capacity trends).;In Finland, the average size of new landbased turbines in 2020 surpassed 4.5 MW, with Norway, Denmark and Sweden also holding an average size of close to 4 MW or more. In Europe, the average size was 3.3 MW.;Offshore turbine sizes are increasing even more the Netherlands reported more than 9 MW average size in 2020, Belgium 8.7 MW, Portugal 8.4 MW, and UK 7 MW. (Appendix Table 8). According to country reports, the average size for newly installed offshore turbines was 7 MW, up from 6.6 MW in 2019 (in Europe 8.2 MW, up from 7.2 MW in 2019).;On average, both landbased and offshore wind power capacity factors show a slightly increasing trend (Figure 8). The highest capacity factors in 2020 for landbased wind turbines were reached in Norway (37), and UK, and Finland (35), with Belgium, the US, Sweden, Canada, Denmark, and Ireland at more than 30 average capacity factor for their wind power fleet generation. For most countries this was the new record. UK hit a new record of more than 45 capacity factor for the offshore wind power plants. Most countries reported more than 40 capacity factor for their offshore fleet.;The trend towards larger turbines, increased capacity factors, and cost reductions continued in 2020. The average installed capacity of new turbines surpassed 3 MW in member countries reporting. For offshore, 7 to 8 MW turbines are increasingly used.;Cumulative Capacity (end of 2020) New Capacity 2020 Increase in Cumulative Capacity Capacity Relative to Country Size Average capacity new land based turbines Average capacity all turbines Average capacity factor Capacity per capita Country MW Country MW Country  Country kWkm2 Country MW Country MW Country  Country kW 1 China 290.747 China 54.427 Norway 63 Germany 174 Finland 4,51 Norway 3,42 Norway 37 Denmark 1,06 2 USA 121.985 USA 16.800 Netherlands 43 Netherlands 159 Denmark 4,23 Finland 3,15 UK 35 Sweden 0,97 3 Germany 62.167 Netherlands 2.060 China 23 Belgium 155 Norway 4,21 Netherlands 2,52 Finland 35 Ireland 0,90 4 India 39.248 Spain 1.720 Belgium 22 Denmark 143 Canada 4,17 Austria 2,39 Belgium 34 Germany 0,75 5 Spain 27.445 Germany 1.650 Sweden 16 UK 102 Sweden 3,93 Sweden 2,33 USA 34 Norway 0,74 6 UK 24.665 Norway 1.532 Switzerland 16 Ireland 61 Netherlands 3,62 UK 2,26 Sweden 31 Spain 0,58 7 France 17.610 India 1.504 Greece 15 Portugal 59 Austria 3,57 Korea 2,23 Ireland 31 Portugal 0,53 8 Canada 13.588 Sweden 1.403 Finland 13 Spain 54 Spain 3,46 Switzerland 2,07 Canada 31 Finland 0,47 9 Italy 10.619 France 1.105 USA 14 Austria 37 Germany 3,41 Germany 2,00 Denmark 30 Belgium 0,41 10 Sweden 10.084 Belgium 836 Japan 13 Italy 35 Japan 3,11 Canada 1,99 Netherlands 28 Austria 0,39 11 Mexico 6.789 Mexico 664 Mexico 11 France 32 Korea 2,70 Portugal 1,97 Greece 28 Netherlands 0,38 12 Netherlands 6.600 UK 570 Korea 10 Greece 31 Italy 2,67 USA 1,81 France 27 Greece 0,37 13 Denmark 6.218 Greece 525 France 7 China 30 Greece 2,63 Japan 1,74 Portugal 26 USA 0,37 14 Portugal 5.478 Japan 516 Spain 7 Sweden 23 Switzerland 2,35 Greece 1,56 Austria 26 UK 0,37 15 Belgium 4.700 Finland 302 India 4 Korea 16 USA 2.75 Italy 1,49 Germany 24 Canada 0,36 16 Japan 4.439 Denmark 220 Ireland 3 USA 12 Portugal 2,26 Spain 1,28 China 24 France 0,26 17 Ireland 4.300 Canada 175 Denmark 3 Japan 12 UK 2,23 Denmark 1,10 Spain 23 China 0,21 18 Greece 4.114 Korea 160 Germany 2 India 12 India 1,02 Korea 23 Italy 0,18 19 Norway 3.977 Ireland 125 UK 2 Norway 10 Switzerland 21 Mexico 0,05 20 Austria 3.120 Italy 102 Canada 1 Finland 8 Japan 21 Japan 0,03 21 Finland 2.586 Portugal 41 Italy 1 Mexico 3 Italy 20 Korea 0,03 22 Korea 1.650 Austria 25 Portugal 1 Switzerland 2 India 18 India 0,03 23 Switzerland 87 Switzerland 12 Austria 1 Canada 1 Switzerland 0,01
