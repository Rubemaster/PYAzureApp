IEA WINDinsight into social acceptance and knowledge on wind energy. The open access tool PocketWinWind (httpswww.pocketwinwind.eu) was designed to facilitate socially inclusive wind energy development and provided useful information to citizens, public administrators, and market actors.;A major component of continued innovation in the wind industry is the ability to conduct demonstration projects and utilise test facilities, which are now located in countries around the world. The IEA Wind TCP member countries support projects that test advanced design and construction methods as well as grid integration and components.;Some projects are not wind energy specific, but indirectly support the wind industry by seeking to further integrate renewable energy sources into the energy system. This includes the ARIES energy research platform that allows NREL researchers and the scientific community to address the fundamental challenges of integrated energy systems at the 20 MW scale.;Several new projects have commenced operations, which reflect the sectors priority for offshore wind, particularly floating concepts and the novel installation and balance of plant solutions. For example, the AFLOWT (Accelerating market uptake of Floating Offshore Wind Technology) aims to demonstrate the survivability and costcompetitiveness of a floating offshore wind technology. Along with the SEMREV test site on the Atlantic Coast, the HexaFloat demonstrator deployment will take place on at the MISTRAL test site on the Mediterranean Coast.;The near future for wind energy is bright and yet challenging. On one hand, it is expected to see a huge growth both in deployment rate and in technological advances and on the other hand, this growth must be done sustainably, with circularity and societal support at its heart. Training and reskilling will also need special attention to promote a just transition and provide the skilled workforce needed for the increased deployment and operation of wind farms.
