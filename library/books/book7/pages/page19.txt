IEA WINDwind projects will generate 3.3 million jobs across the full value chain over the coming five years when global annual wind power installations are expected to exceed 110 GW (GWEC, 2021).;Wind energy is energy is an important sector in the European economy. In the EU, it generated 37 billion EUR (45.2 billion USD) to the GDP and employs 300,000 people (75 of these onshore and 25 offshore). In Denmark, the wind energy industry employed 32,744 people in 2019. Spain and France employed 30,000 and 18,200, respectively (Appendix Table 11).

The UK reported that turnover in the UK lowcarbon and renewable energyeconomy was estimated to be 54.2 billion GBP (53.5 billion EUR64.3 billion USD) in 2019, of which 6.0 billion GBP was generated by the wind energy sector. In terms of employment, the total number of employees remained stable around 12,700. In the US nearly 117,000 Americans were directly employed by the wind industry.;Several member countries calculated the CO2 emissions (million tonsyear) avoided attributable to wind energy deployment. In many countries, wind energy is the largest renewable contributor to emission savings (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, and the UK). The special circumstances of 2020 led the electricity demand to drop in several countries. In the UK, the pandemic has a major impact on the GHG emissions being 48.8 lower than in 1990 and the average carbon intensity fell to 181 g CO2kWh, a reduction of 66 over the last seven years due to higher shares of renewable in the system, more than half coming from wind energy.;Largescale use of wind energy may impact wildlife and thus challenge wind energy deployment. Many countries have invested in research and strategies to understand potential environmental impacts and benefits to make informed decisions that balance the need for renewable energy with the need to sustain and protect local wildlife. More information is available in Task 34 on environmental impacts of wind energy.;Figure 10. Number of jobs in the global wind energy industry 200919.
