costcovering feedin tariff (FIT) for renewable energy in Switzerland has been in place since 2009 1. This policy promotes wind energy andhas led to an increase in new wind energy projects. Financing is currently requested for an additional 3.3 TWh under the FIT scheme;By the end of 2020, Switzerland had 42 large wind turbines in operation with a total rated power of 87 MW. These turbines produced 146 GWh of electricity in 2020. The construction of a new wind farm with a capacity of 12 MW began in 2019 it will be operational by end of 2020, increasing the total wind power capacity by 15.;At the end of 2024, about 4.5 GW wind power should be installed in the Dutch part of the North Sea according to the first road map. Until;In 2020, the total installed wind power capacity was 6.6 GW, which is considerably more than the 4.5 GW in 2019. This is mainly due to the increase in offshore wind power from 1 GW to 2.5 GW in line with the planned rollout of the Borssele wind farms.;RUUD OERLEMANS, Rijksdienst Voor Ondernemend Nederland (www.RVO.nl). The Netherlands. ruud.oerlemansrvo.nl.;Throughout 2020, wind power was the second largest source of electricity generation in Spain, with a relative generation growth of up 5.8.;According to the Spanish National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan 20212030 (NECP) the government is committed to reach about 50,258 GW of installed wind capacity which means about 28.86 billion EUR (35.29 billion USD) to meet European targets for 2030.;Renewable sourcesbased power supply in Spain reached 44 of total power consumption in 2020. (Total power demand declined by 5.6).;onsidering the overall renewable power capacity installed in Portugal, the electricity production in 2020 reached 64 of thenational consumption, a small decrease compared to the previous year. On 25 October 2020, between 0300 and 0815 a.m., continental Portugal met 100 of its electricity needs with wind energy during several periods. The instantaneous electricity demand met by wind energy during this period was 105.;In 2020, no new wind farms were installed in Portugal. However, additional capacity was added to existing wind farms and corresponded, in total, to 41 MW. In this sense, by the end of 2020, 5,478 MW was operating in the country, corresponding to 38 of the national total renewable operational capacity. The windbased electrical energy in 2020 was 12.36 TWh, meeting 25 of the Portugals electricity demand.;he United States had 121,985 megawatts (MW) of operating wind power capacity 1, with 67,814 wind turbines operating across 42 statesand two U.S. territories at the end of 2020 5. Wind energy companies employed 116,817 workers in 2020 6. Project developers and power purchasers reported power purchase agreement activity totaling 5,444 MW in 2020 4.;THE 8,000ACRE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER PINE TREE WIND AND SOLAR FARM IN THE TEHACHAPI MOUNTAINS NORTH OF MOJAVE, CALIFORNIA, FEATURES 80 1.5MEGAWATT (MW) GENERAL ELECTRIC WIND TURBINES AND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST MUNICIPALLY OWNED WIND FARMS IN THE UNITED STATES. PHOTO BY DENNIS SCHROEDER, NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY (NREL);Wind power capacity in the United States grew at a record pace in 2020, adding 16.8 gigawatts (GW) 1. Wind continues to be the top source of renewable energy production in the United States 2. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) states that wind accounted for 9.2 of U.S. electric sales or 8.3 of U.S. generation in 2020 3.;U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGYS WIND ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES OFFICE, NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY;hrough the EU burdensharing agreement, Sweden has a goal of greenhouse gas emission reduction of 40 in 2030 in relation to 2005 levels. At the national level, Sweden is to have no netemissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2045 and should thereafter achieve negative emissions. To achieve zero net emissions, emissions from activities in Swedish territory are to be at least 85 lower than emissions in 1990. Another national goal is to reach 100 renewable electricity production in 2040. The Swedish Energy Agency estimates that the country will;PROTOTYPE TURBINE AT SWPTC WITH WOODEN TOWER FROM MODVION ON BJRK (GOTHENBURG), NACELLE HEIGHT 30 M, ROTOR DIAMETER 16 M. (SOURCE MODVION).;In 2020, Sweden installed 1,403 MW of new wind energy capacity (1,588 MW were installed in 2019). At the end of the year, the countrys total installed capacity was 10,084 MW from 4 333 wind turbines.;Industrial and nondomestic consumption dropped by 10 in contrast to domestic use which increased by 4.1 Wind energy provided over 56 of the total annual electricity generation from renewables (26 onshore and 30 offshore).2;The UK maintained its dominant position in offshore wind with installations growing 412 MW to 10.4 GW in 2020. Onshore wind capacity only increased by 157 MW, but this is set to accelerate with onshore wind projects allowed to compete in the same pot as solar energy in upcoming auctions.;High winds in spring 2020 combined with low energy demand due to COVID19 allowed renewable energy to outpace annual fossil fuel generation for the first time. Electricity demand was at its lowest level in over a decade with 281 TWh final consumption, a 4.7 decrease from 2019.
