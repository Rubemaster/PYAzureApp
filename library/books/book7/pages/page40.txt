n 2020, Austria installed seven turbines with a capacity of 25 MW, compared to 59 turbines in 2019. By the end of 2020, more than 3,120 MWwere installed. As a result comparing installed and decommissioned turbines in Austria gained a net reduction of existing wind power plants. 1. The estimated feasib e potential until 2030 is at 7,500 MW with 22.5 TWh p.a. 2.;Austria has set ambitious renewable energy and climate protection targets of reaching 100 renewable electricity by 2030. Nevertheless, the year 2020 marked a further decline in the expansion of wind power. Continuing political uncertainties and administrative barriers are slowing down the expansion significantly.;Belgium is a frontrunner for installed capacity relative to the available space, the bathymetry, and the distance from shore. Prominent researchers and research institutions place Belgium as a leader in offshore wind power.;In general, Belgiums renewable energy policy is aligned with the EU 2020 targets. Belgiums landbased and offshore wind energy developments are essential for both Belgian and European targets for energy development from renewable sources. For 2020,;BELGIUMin 2004 created a 156km area in the Belgian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in international waters for wind farms. The first wind turbines were installed in this area in 2009. At the end of 2020, 399 offshore wind turbines were operationalproducing 8 TWhyr.;As electrical demand was 2.6 lower than in 2019, the share of wind increased to more than 6. The total combined federal and provincial R,DD budget increased in 2020 to 7.93 million CAD (5.08 EUR 6.22 million USD), more than double the 2019 budget. Notable R,DD activities in 2020 included initiatives for improving cold climate performance of;During 2020, 175 MW of new wind capacity was installed in Canada, a moderate decline from the last few years, partially as a result of project delays due to the global pandemic. However, wind production reached a record high for Canada, with over 36 TWh of electricity generated, representing a 10.6 increase from production in 2019.;This brings the total wind power capacity to 17.6 GW. Wind and solar now jointly represent 50 of France renewable installed power capacity, while wind alone represented 30 of the;his brings the total wind power capacity to 17.6 GW. Wind and solar now jointly represent 50 of France renewable installed power capacity, while wind alone represented 30 of thetotal renewable electricity production and 8.8  of the national electricity demand in 2020. Total annual electrical energy output from wind was 39.7 TWh, a significant increase from 2019. This increase is the result of higher installed power capacity, in conjunction with a capacity factor of 26.5 , substantially higher than the year before.;In 2020, over 1.1 GW new onshore wind was built in France. This number shows a third consecutive year of decrease, well below the average of 1.5 GW over the previous years. It should in the future increase to 2 GW per year to reach the newly set targets for 2023.;n November, the European Commission published the Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy 2, which highlights the role that every offshore technologywill have in supporting the key ambition of the European Green Dealcarbon neutrality by 2050. Thus, considering the European Green Deal longterm vision of climate neutrality through a new growth strategy 3, the EU is currently in the process of reviewing these targets, aiming at a 55 GHG reduction target by 2030. Together, these goals, new and ongoing alike, represent a powerful driving force for renewables, particularly wind energy.;The European Union will have at least 32 of its energy demand (heat and power) from renewable sources by 2030, meeting an estimated 50 of the power demand. Notably, in 2020, renewable energy production surpassed for the first time that of fossil fuel sources 1.;New wind power of 302 MW capacity was installed in Finland. By the years end, installed wind power capacity amounted to 2,586 MW with 7.8 TWh of productiona 30 increase from 2019. Renewables provided about 42 of the countrys electricity consumption in 2020;THE BTSKAR WIND FARM IS THE FOCUS OF A MEASUREMENT CAMPAIGN IN PROJECT TUTTE, AIMING AT UNDERSTANDING THE WIND INFLOW AND WAKE INTERACTIONS. THE WIND FARM IS BUILT ACROSS FOUR ISLETS IN LAND ISLANDS. PHOTO CREDIT MANU HUTTUNEN;Year 2020 was remarkable for wind energy. Amidst the pandemic, installations continued to grow and higherthannormal wind conditions took the wind share to 9.6 of electricity consumption 1.;Windgenerated electricity met 48.0 of the domestic electricity supply in 2020 compared to 47.2 in 2019. This is still by far the highest share globally, and the share could have reached a new record of around 51 if the production from wind turbines had not been curtailed. The high amount of special downregulation is a sign that there;The wind power capacity in Denmark has been stable around 6 GW for nearly four years. Installed total wind power capacity increased by 220 MW onshore capacity and no new offshore capacity in 2020. This brings Denmarks total capacity to 6.311 GW of which 1.7 GW is offshore. Although the Covid19 pandemic caused a decrease in the domestic energy consumption in 2020, it has not affected the wind deployment or RD much.;2020. New wind power capacity accounted for 12.8 of installed power capacity nationwide.;Wind power remains the third largest generation source in China, following thermal and hydroelectricity sources. The average fullloadhour of wind power was 2,097 hours in 2020, an increase of 15 hours from 2019.;China continues to have the highest wind power capacity in the world. The wind power capacity growth presented a higher rate, and 54,427MW of new wind power capacity was installed, representing a 103.2 increase in growth from last year.
