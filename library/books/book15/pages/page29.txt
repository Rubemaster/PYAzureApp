Table 1.3 Wind farm consenting regimes in the UK.a Permit applications for wind farm projects over 50 MW in England and Wales will be consented by the Local Planning Authority under the Town and Country Planning Act from 2016.;The size of a proposed wind farm has a direct bearing on its planning process, with different consenting regimes for proposed wind farms of greater or less than 50 MW (Table 1.3). An important first step in the examination process for all applications is to determine whether they are in line with national, regional and local planning policies. It is therefore the duty of the applicant, invariably the wind farm developer, to ensure that the application meets all relevant policy requirements.;Since the introduction of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in the USA through the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, many industrialised counties have adopted some requirement for the consideration of potential impacts on the environment during the development phase of infrastructure projects (Table 1.4). Within the European Union (EU), this requirement is implemented through the EIA Directive (EU 2014), which requires an assessment to be carried out by the competent national authority in each member state for certain projects, such as wind farms (Box 1.1). Several other EU directives also influence the development process, such as the Habitats Directive (EU 1992) and Birds Directive (EU 2009b). These EU directives are discussed in more detail in Box 1.2.
