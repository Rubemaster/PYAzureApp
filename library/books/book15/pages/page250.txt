Figure 8.6 A Griffon Vulture, an obligate soaring bird with low manoeuvrability, flying among wind turbines in Tarifa Wind Resource Area. (Migres Foundation);Eichhorn et al. (2012) developed a spatially explicit agentbased model that simulates the foraging behaviour of breeding Red Kite around its eyrie in a landscape comprised of different landuse types. They detected a decline in the collision risk of Red Kite with increasing distance from the nest, with the strength of this depending on whether the bird was foraging, the ability to avoid turbines and the mean wind speed. Foraging behaviour was also an important determinant of the collision of Common Kestrels at wind turbines in Tarifa (Barrios  Rodrguez 2004). In the APWRA, Smallwood has suggested that foraging behaviour such as hovering by Redtailed Hawk or aggressive encounters between eagles and mobbing of large raptors by species such as corvids may be distracting and enhance collision risk. As a result, behavioural surveys should form part of any survey programme (see Chapter 11 in this volume).;Vision is the primary sense used by birds to gain information about their environment (Martin 2011). In visibility simulations in the laboratory, Hodos (2003) and Hodos et al. (2000) showed that when
