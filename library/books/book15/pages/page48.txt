This chapter examines how a collection of wind turbines in a defined region may create meteorological conditions different enough from its surroundings to change the structure and function of above or belowground ecosystems. Despite the rapid expansion in the number of wind farms, there are very few in situ measurements from which to establish the aerodynamic and thermodynamic characteristics, that is the microclimate, of wind farms. Consequently, conceptual models from analogues in natural or humanconstructed landscapes were needed to guide thinking about the ways in which wind farms may influence ecosystems. Wind tunnel simulations of wind farms provide insight on the changes in aerodynamic (e.g. wind speed, turbulence) characteristics of wind farms. Analysis of field measurements taken within wind farms and leeward of agricultural shelterbelts provides thermodynamic (e.g. heatingcooling, evaporationcondensation, solar and infrared radiation) characteristics needed to construct an informed conceptual model of how turbines may affect plant functioning. Measurements show that within wind farms, turbines create nighttime warming of about 1C and daytime cooling of less than 1C. Satellite measurements of surface radiating conditions provide spatial maps of surface temperature that generally agree with point surface measurements within wind farms. Carbon dioxide flux measurements in a wind farm suggest that turbines promote carbon uptake by plants during the day and increase plant respiration at night. Published studies on the regional and global impacts of large wind farms show that such effects are small as compared to, say, changes that would create measurable effects on crop yield. Global models give some evidence that large continental wind farms may create nonlocal climate effects, such as small
