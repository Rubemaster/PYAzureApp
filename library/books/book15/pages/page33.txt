Figure 1.8 Key stages in the development process.;Site selection is an important stage in the development process as location plays a vital role in the performance and efficiency of a wind farm, but also allows developers to identify sites where potential effects on local communities, wildlife and landscape will be minimised. Geographic information systems (GIS) are a key tool in this process. These systems are designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyse, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data. Generally, they comprise a base map of the area of interest into which data for relevant attributes can be incorporated.;The first stage in site selection is the identification of areas that provide a suitable wind resource. Exposed sites, coastal locations and sites at higher altitudes often provide this requirement and there are a number of resources that can assist in this processes. In the USA, the Department for Energy hosts wind resource maps that show the predicted mean wind speed across the country at 80 m with links to statelevel wind maps of finer resolution (US Department of Energy 2015). The European Environment Agency (EEA) provides a similar service for Europe (EEA 2009), and wind resource maps catering for small, medium and utilityscale wind turbines are provided by the Met Office in the UK (Met Office 2015).
