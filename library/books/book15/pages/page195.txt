Displacement of birds from onshore wind farms has been suggested for many species. The data available for evaluation (Table 7.1) is clearly biased towards bird species occurring in open landscapes and raptors because most wind farms are situated in open landscapes, with raptors receiving more attention as a result of their high collision rates (see Chapter 8 in this volume). Birds living in other habitats, such as woodland birds, have been studied less frequently, although there is an increasing trend towards planningwind farms in forests, at least in Germany (Richarz 2014). In six species, the analysis of all available data (including anecdotal observations) showed that there were significantly more studies showing displacement than studies not showing displacement (Table 7.1). The most severely affected groups of species were Anseriform (swans, ducks and geese) and Charadriiform (shorebirds and gulls) birds (Table 7.2). This general pattern is supported by the studies with BACI or GI designs, and it reflects the conclusions of earlier reviews (Langston  Pullan 2003 Reichenbach 2003 Stewart et al. 2007 Htker 2008). All other groups of birds seem to be less affected by displacement, although single species such as some opencountry passerines may be exceptions (see Box 7.1).
