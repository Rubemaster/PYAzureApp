Genetic pollution may be caused by revegetation with different species or varieties that are not of local provenance. Simple actions that favour the natural regeneration of vegetation are usually conducted at the end of the construction phase with the aim of achieving a more integrated landscape. Commonly used actions include terrain modelling, spreading topsoil in the targeted areas and distributing seed by hydroseeding, which is a specific technique using a slurry of seed and mulch sprayed over the landscape (Figure 3.8). Standard mixtures of commercial varieties of grass species, such as Common Bent Agrostis capillaris, Creeping Bent Agrostis stolonifera and Red Fescue Festuca rubra, are commonly used. Rather than promote natural revegetation, large landscaping projects may unintentionally promote genetic contamination risk, where the species used are in close proximity to native populations, are sexually compatible with native populations, comprise wind pollinated species and are of limited genetic diversity of clonal material from distant or unknown source populations (Rogers 2007). Genetic pollution can also be triggered by the accidental introduction and propagation of species within topsoil originating from locations other than the siting area, or even on vehicles or people from other regions as a result of increased accessibility due to the presence of new or better roads within the site.;Figure 3.8 The application of hydroseeding in a Portuguese wind farm (Bio3).;The introduction of nonlocal genes may ultimately affect the genetic integrity of the surrounding native populations as an indirect and permanent negative effect. Hybridisation between native and introduced individuals alters the gene pool of the native populations (Fraga et al. 2008). Some authors argue that any changes in genetic structure and their consequences should be monitored on both a shortterm and a longterm basis.
