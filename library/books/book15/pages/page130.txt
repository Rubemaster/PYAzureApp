It is important to note, however, that many potential conflicts can be overcome with targeted mitigation, and to illustrate thepoint, a case study on the Freshwater Pearl Mussel Margaritifera margaritifera, one of the most sensitive organisms in freshwater systems and considered to be a sentinel of aquatic ecosystem health, is provided (Box 5.1). This also helps to inform a series of general solutions to any potential issues outlined in the Concluding remarks.;The Freshwater Pearl Mussel (FPM) Margaritifera margaritifera (Figure 5.1) is a bivalve listed under both Annex II and Annex V of the EU Habitats Directive (9243EEC). Globally, freshwater mussel populations are declining at an alarming rate (Neves 2004), with many, like M. margaritifera, considered to be critically endangered (Reid et al. 2013). The species has a complicated life history (Bauer 1987 Skinner et al. 2003), with the early larval lifestage (glochidium) attaching to the gills of a salmonid fish (salmon or trout) encountered as the larva drifts downstream. In the following late spring or early summer the larva drops off and settles in suitable substrate where it may live for 100 years or more. The typical substrate preference is small sand patches stabilised amongst large stones or boulders in fastflowing streams and rivers (Skinner et al. 2003). A healthy population of suitable fish hosts in rivers of high water quality and clean substrate are essential, making the FPM a key biological indicator species for the habitat quality of river ecosystems.;Figure 5.1 Freshwater Pearl Mussels Margaritifera margaritifera on the bed of an Irish stream.
