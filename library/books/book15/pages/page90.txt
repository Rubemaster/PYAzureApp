The data collected showed that 3 years after construction in 2009, the number of stands and the number of individuals of invasive species had increased considerably (Figure 3.7). The invasive species were observed to be spreading along the windfarm infrastructure, especially access roads and platforms (pads). New invasion sites were also found, suggesting that this increase was related to construction activity (Figure 3.6). A further two other invasive species also appeared in the wind farm area. After the monitoring, a control and eradication plan was implemented to guarantee the eradication of the invasive vegetation.;Figure 3.7 The number of individuals of the alien species Acacia dealbata and A. melanoxylon in different types of wind farm infrastructure (access roads and platforms) and overall, in different years before, during and after construction in 2009.;When invasive plants are present and potential proliferation is identified as a negative effect resulting from project implementation, action during the construction phase in cooperation with the wind farm developer is recommended, with the specific aim of avoiding the spread of invasive species. Actions include the correct disposal of plant debris, measures to prevent seed dispersal during the removal of vegetation and using only soil from noninvaded areas in recovered areas.;After construction, it is important to implement a control eradication plan and a monitoring programme in the area surrounding the project area (Box 3.3). The control will eliminate any nuclei present, limiting seed input into areas otherwise suitable for dispersion. The methods can differ according to species, although combining different methods is usually is most effective (Plantas invasoras em Portugal 2015). For example, in the case of most Acacia spp. this consists of pulling seedlings out regularly, ring barking adults or cutting them accompanied by chemical treatment (Marchante et al. 2005 Passos 2014).
