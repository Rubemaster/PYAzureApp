Fatality rate adjustments cannot adjust for species whose individuals were killed by wind turbines but not detected during monitoring, because a zero value cannot be adjusted (Smallwood 2007). For this reason, the Ogin study revealed abat fatality rate whereas the ICF study did not. Also, whereas the all birds estimate from Ogins monitoring was three times larger when including only the species found by both Ogin and ICF, it was four times larger when including all of the species found by Ogin during the fiveday search intervals. In conclusion, the APWRAs impacts on small birds and bats are greater than previously believed, and the difference in the perceived impacts is due to the search interval. Raptors as a group may not be more susceptible to wind turbine collisions than other bird species.;Table 8.4 Fatality rates estimated from Ogins fatality searches in the period 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 at 157 wind turbines selected for known high fatality rates, and fatality rates estimated from ICF searches at the same turbines from 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012.
