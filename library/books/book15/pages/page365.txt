Figure 11.4 Densities of breeding Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago declined during construction of wind farms in the study of PearceHiggins et al. (2012), and did not recover during operation. The underpinning mechanism behind displacement was unclear. It was also unknown whether displaced birds were lost from the breeding population as a result of densitydependence or if they managed to breed elsewhere. (Martin R. Perrow);Figure 11.5 Increased densities of Eurasian Stonechat Saxicola rubicola were observed in wind farms undergoing construction in the study of PearceHiggins et al. (2012). Stonechats feed on invertebrates that are often caught on the ground and birds may have benefited from vegetation clearance and disturbance creating suitable foraging patches. (Martin R.
