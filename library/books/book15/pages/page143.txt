Figure 5.5 To accurately assess the impact of a proposed wind farm development and to inform effective mitigation, the provision of accurate baseline ecological data, such as by undertaking fisheries surveys through electric fishing, is essential. (William OConnor);Sensitive design is the most important mitigation measure to reduce impacts, for example ensuring the geotechnical stability of the site, minimising works near watercourses and providing a suitable Surface Water Management Plan. Avoidance mitigation would include not undertaking instream works during fish and lamprey spawning seasons, and locating turbines at least 50 m away from the nearest watercourse. It is noted that erosion control preventing runoff in the first place is much more effective than sediment control in preventing water pollution Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) 2006. Any works programme associated with wind farm construction needs to incorporate erosion and sediment control before starting site works, and provide monitoring and maintenance of these controls throughout the project. There is a range of suitable good practice guidance available, such as that by Scottish Renewables, Scottish Natural Heritage, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Forestry Commission Scotland and Historic Scotland (2013), which is specific guidance for wind farm construction. Other relevant guidance includes CIRIA (2006) for roads and cable trenches, Scottish Executive (2000) for the design of river crossings, Forestry Commission (2011) for forestry operations, and Scottish Natural Heritage (2010) and Scottish Renewables and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (2012) for working on peat.
