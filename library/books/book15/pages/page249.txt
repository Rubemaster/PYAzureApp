The age of a bird may also be an important factor in the probability of collision. Hunt (1999) showed that among turbine strike fatalities of Golden Eagles, 85 were subadults, 12 were floaters and only 3 were breeders, although this was not unexpected because breeders seldom visited the wind farm area. In the case of the Whitetailed Eagles studied by Dahl et al. (2013), behaviour was similar inside and outside the wind farm, but the flight activity of territoryholding adults within the wind farm was reduced compared to that of subadults passing through, potentially making them more vulnerable. Barrios and Rodriguez (2004) established that all the dead Common Kestrels they could age were juvenile birds.;Moreover, an uneven sex ratio among collision victims has been shown by some studies. Sixtyone per cent of the Golden Eagles found dead by Hunt (1999) were males, although this may have been due to a sex bias in the population. A similar bias (64) towards the mortality of male Common Tern was recorded in the study of Stienen et al. (2008). Here, the unequal sex ratio was most pronounced during the incubation period and early chickfeeding, when male fatalities increased to 78. An increased in the frequency of foraging flights by males relative to females as males provision their mate and young chicks was thought to be responsible. Similarly, Morinha et al. (2014) classified 90.9 of the Eurasian Skylarks Alauda arvensis found dead at wind farms in northern Portugal over 6 years of monitoring as adult males. This was attributed to the ascending song flight behaviour of males during breeding time. In the north of Spain, Onrubia et al. (2001) also detected high mortality of this species in a wind farm, again concentrated in the breeding period.
