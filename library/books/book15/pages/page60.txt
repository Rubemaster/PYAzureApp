Armstrong et al. (2014) expanded on this list and broadened the consideration to encompass natural ecosystems and carbon cycling. Considering the rate of and potential for wind plant development, they argued that the current knowledge on environmental impacts of large wind and solar energy installations is incomplete. They also specifically called for field studies and modelling of both above and belowground components of ecosystems to quantify the impacts of wind turbines on plantsoil cycling of carbon and plant nutrients. Carbon cycling influences will be particularly important for wind farms located in regions of high soil carbon content such as moist peat bogs (Carbon Brief 2013).;To attempt to answer the key question of whether these rates of exchange of heat, water and trace gases were large enough to have measurable effects on ecosystem structure and function, the Crop Windenergy EXperiment (CWEX) series of field experiments undertook extensive in situ microclimate measurements during the growing season within a wind farm (Rajewski et al. 2013).
