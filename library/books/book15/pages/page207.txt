Reported avoidance distances varied between species, but also within species between studies. In general, avoidance distances were small, such as 200 m for Northern Wheatear (PearceHiggins et al. 2009). Some species, however, consistently show high avoidance distances, especially during the nonbreeding season. These species, identified in Table 7.8 and Figure 7.3, represent the groups established as being the most wary of wind farms in the section Groups and species affected, above, including swans, geese, ducks and waders. In such species, the effect of wind farms can be noticed up to 800 m for Golden Plover (Pedersen  Poulsen 1991) and Eurasian Curlew (PearceHiggins et al. 2009). Avoidance distanceswere generally smaller in passerines, and particular studies during the nonbreeding season revealed hardly any avoidance at all (Figure 7.3). There is some limited evidence that avoidance distances are larger for flocks than for single birds (Everaert 2008).;Figure 7.3 Median avoidance distances maintained by different bird species from wind turbines. b breeding season (circles) nb nonbreeding season (rhombi). Species are arranged in systematic order. Common and scientific names for species codes are provided in Table 7.9.;Table 7.8 Minimum distances of different bird species from wind turbines according to different literature studies (from Htker 2008).
