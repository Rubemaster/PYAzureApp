As well as being liberally decorated with tables, figures and especially photographs, which are reproduced in colour courtesy ofsponsorship by Vattenfall, most chapters also contain Boxes of information. These were designed to be provide particularly important examples of a particular point or case or suffice as an all round exemplar and standalone from the text. In some cases, these have been written by an invited author(s) with the principal that it is better to see the words from the hands of those involved than to paraphrase published studies. Boxes also provided an opportunity to widen the geographic spread of information in the chapter.;I take any deficiencies in the scope and content in this and its sister volume to be my responsibility, particularly as both closely align to my original vision, and many authors have patiently tolerated and incorporated my sometimes extensive editorial changes to initial outlines and draft manuscripts. My sincere thanks to all 23 chapter authors and 16 additional Box (case study) authors for their contributions. From my perspective, at least, there can be no satisfaction without at least a little pain. I hope the authors feel the same. I also hope that these volumes are a further step towards the sustainable development of wind farms and the ultimate goal of winwin1 scenario for renewable energy and wildlife;1Kiesecker, J.M., Evans, J.S., Fargione, J., Doherty, K., Foresman, K.R., Kunz, T.H., Naugle, D., Nibbelink, N.P.
