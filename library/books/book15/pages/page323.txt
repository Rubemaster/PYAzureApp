Figure 10.3 Iberian wolf adults and pup in pack B resting near the breeding site. The adult on the far left is one of the GPScollared individuals. (Artur Oliveira);Results from both case studies (Figure 10.4) showed that (1) before construction of the wind farm, packs reproduced regularly and showed a high fidelity to breeding sites located less than 2 km from future wind turbines (2) during the two year construction phase, packs selected the same or a new breeding site located close to the turbines (1 km), although the breeding rate decreased and (3) during operation, packs selected new breeding sites that were located progressively farther from the wind farm (to 4 km), where they resumed more regular reproduction. Telemetry data revealed a shift in home range away from the wind farm during the first and second years of the operational phase, apparently following the changes in breeding site locations (Figure 10.5). However, the tracked wolves still used the wind farm area on a regular basis during both construction and operation.;Wolf packs show a complex response to wind farm development, involving a decrease in breeding success and a shift in denning sites to resume regular reproduction. Such effects raise concern, particularly where the availability of suitable breeding sites is a limiting factor and cumulative effects of other threats (e.g. additional infrastructure, human caused wolf mortality) may affect the population. This is particularly relevant in endangered wolf populations occurring in highly humanised and heterogeneous landscapes, such as in Portugal. On the evidence presented here, a precautionary approach of protecting known wolf breeding sites from wind power development should be adopted (i.e. as noconstruction areas) to minimise the negative effects of wind farms on wolves. Further longterm monitoring studies should also be conducted to evaluate both the degree of tolerance of wolves to
