Although the number of species reported to be killed at wind turbines in Europe (n19) is similar to the number in North America (n20) (Table 9.1), fatalities in Europe are not as stronglydominated by a few species. Nonetheless, 86.6 of recorded fatalities in Europe belong to species of two genera, Pipistrellus (Figure 9.3) and Nyctalus (Figure 9.4), and this increases to 93.3 if Eptesicus and Vespertilio are included. Some of these species are migratory (Table 9.1), and in others, such as the Soprano Pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Leislers Bat, northern populations are migratory but southern ones are resident year round (Ibaez et al. 2009). As in North America, some relatively common species such Myotis and Plecotus spp. (longeared bats) are rarely killed by turbines in Europe (Table 9.1).;Figure 9.4 Leislers Bat Nyctalus leisleri drinking. Northern populations of this species are migratory, a behaviour associated with many of the species killed in large numbers at turbines. (Jens Rydell);A feature common to the most frequently killed species, not only in North America and Europe, but elsewhere as well (Table 9.1), is a wing design associated with fast flight in open spaces, often well above the ground (e.g. Baage 1987 Collins  Jones 2009). These species have wings with a relatively high aspect ratio (a measure of wing shape, where high values indicate long, narrow wings) and high wing loading (the body mass per unit wing area). Collectively in North America and Europe, species making up 3 or more of total fatalities (Table 9.1) on average have a higher aspect ratio (n12, mean7.04) and wing loading (mean11.2 Nm2) than do those making up less than 3 of the total fatalities (n14, mean aspect ratio6.24, mean wing loading8.5 Nm2 t test, P0.05 in each case). High wing loading and high
