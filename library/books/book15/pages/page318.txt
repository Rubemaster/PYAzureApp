Studies on the impacts of wind power on the abundance of terrestrial mammals (excluding bats) in wind farms are few and show varying results. Studies on disturbance from noise and visual cues from wind turbines are particularly scarce, and the results are inconclusive. Nevertheless, a significant but temporary avoidance of wind farms during construction has been reported for large carnivores and ungulates. Studies addressing the effects of disturbance from the maintenance and operation of wind farms are nearly absent, but studies on similar types of roads and traffic in gas fields indicate some avoidance of the roads, even those with very low traffic. Another aspect of roads is that they may increase public access, with traffic potentially exceeding that required for maintenance, and a potential increase also in outdoor recreation and offroad vehicles. Large carnivores and ungulates are known to be particularly sensitive to these types of human disturbances. Roads and power lines associated with wind power can also function as barriers to movement for both smaller and larger species, or conversely roads can act as corridors for movement. Habitat conversion may also benefit some species by providing denning habitat, forage or prey. The total effects of wind farms on nonflying terrestrial mammals are expected to depend on species, degree of habituation, landscape type and pressure from existing human influence in the area, and are therefore difficult to predict. Particular concern is raised for larger mammals as current onshore wind power development can target refugia for large carnivores or important grazing or migration areas for ungulates. Efforts should be made to minimise the negative effects on these species as a
