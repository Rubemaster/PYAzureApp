Figure 11.3 Flight lines of visually tracked (see Perrow et al. 2011) breeding Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis at an offshore site in eastern England (a) before and during construction (total n739) and (b) in the first year of operation (n317).;In general, however, raptors are generally not thought to be susceptible to disturbance or displacement as a result of being insensitive to risk, in keeping with their position at the top of the food chain with no natural predators. Species lower in the food chain have evolved visual systems geared to detecting risks from predators as well as finding food, shelter and mates. This may be at the root of their tendency to be wary of unfamiliar situations including a new, large imposing object(s) in their environment. Waterfowl (ducks and geese), wading birds and passerines are among the most riskaverse groups and often respond negatively to the presence of wind farms. Responses have often been measured as avoidance distance from turbines. Pooling results from many, especially unpublished, studies, Htker (Chapter 7) was able to show that median avoidance distances of birds typically range from 50 to 300 m, although some individual studies report values of up to 800 m. Small passerines appear to be less likely to display avoidance over larger distances, perhaps as they are less able to perceive the threat of turbines. Alternatively, this could be an artefact of the nature of the studies undertaken as most studies on passerines were conducted in the breeding season when avoidance distances were generally lower. In turn, it could be that in the face
