The development of wind energy continues to increase around the world. Following the first studies on collisions of birds with turbines in the 1990s, knowledge has been shared through published papers and reports and through a series of regional, national and international meetings, and it is crucial that this trend continues. This chapter aims to summarise the current state of the science through a review of the available literature. A series of highprofile studies on raptors in various parts of Europe and North America have shaped the view that raptors are particularly vulnerable to collision. More recent studies have indicated that even passerines may be vulnerable in particular circumstances. Better experimental design and the standard use of methods to estimate scavenger removal, searcher efficiency and search radius are required to ensure that the effects on small species are detected. Various factors are responsible for collision events and the complexity of their interaction makes it difficult to understand how collision occurs. Speciesspecific factors (morphology, behaviour, vision, hearing, abundance and migration), wind farm characteristics (turbines, configuration and lights) and terrain topography may all be important. As a consequence, the estimates of bird deaths from collision with turbines range considerably. Nevertheless, the variation between turbines in the same site may be higher than the variation between sites and it is clear that some turbines are especially dangerous to birds. This introduces considerable scope to design and configure wind farms to reduce collision mortality. In general, populations of most species seem not to be significantly affected by this additional source of mortality, although there are examples of local depletion of vulnerable species. Moreover, cumulative effects of mortality across the range of migratory species
