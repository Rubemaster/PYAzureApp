Nevertheless, it has generally been noted that birds of prey are more prone to collision with wind turbines than other groups of birds (Table 8.1), including in the USA (Orloff  Flannery 1992, 1993 Nelson  Curry 1995 Hunt 1998 2002 Morrison et al. 1998 Morrison 2002 Smallwood  Thelander 2004 2008), Germany (Htker et al. 2006 Htker 2008), Spain (Lekuona  Ursa 2007 de Lucas et al. 2008 Farfn et al. 2009 Ferrer et al. 2012), Norway (Bevanger et al. 2008) and the UK (Madders  Whitfield 2006). This conclusion is typically based on the numbers of dead birds recovered. For example, the most frequent collision victims in a national collision database in Germany are Common Buzzard Buteo buteo, Red Kite and Whitetailed Eagle. However, if population size is taken into account, then it is Whitetailed Eagle that appears to be the most vulnerable, with Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina also prominent (see Box 8.1). Similarly, in Spain, Griffon Vulture, Common Kestrel and Shorttoed Eagle have the highest mortalityrates, but the analysis by Martin and colleagues in Box 8.2 for soaring birds in southern Spain suggests that whereas Griffon Vulture is the most frequent collision victim, disproportionally more Booted Eagles Aquila pennata, Common Kestrels and Montagus Harriers are killed relative to population size. This points to the importance of speciesspecific factors (see Speciesspecific factors, below).;Furthermore, in Box 8.3, Smallwood, working in Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA), illustrates that the general assumption that raptors are killed more frequently than other species may be more perception rather than reality, as a result of the failure to detect and recover the bodies of smaller species, including pigeons and passerines. In general, information on passerine mortality may have been limited by a combination of fewer studies, lower detection rates and rapid scavenger removal as well as lower actual collision rates, although this is difficult to establish (Drewitt  Langston 2008).;There are, however, studies that have shown passerines to be frequent collision victims (e.g. Kerns  Kerlinger 2004 Fiedler et al. 2007). In the north of Portugal, the most affected species recorded by Morinha et al. (2014) were Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis (37.3 of carcasses) and House Martin Delichon urbicum (32.2). A scientific review of 116 studies from the USA and Canada also draws attention to smallbird fatality rates (Erickson et al. 2014). In this study, some species of passerines were disproportionally represented within their respective families. For example, about 82.3 of collisions within Vireonidae were of Redeyed Vireo Vireo olivaceus, with 52.6 of found fatalities among the Icteridae being Western Meadowlark Sturnella neglecta. Regulidae is comprised of two species in North America, but Goldencrowned Kinglet Regulus satrapa made up 71.5 of fatalities for that family. Again, species specific differences in behaviour (see Speciesspecific factors, below), making some species more vulnerable to collision, may be indicated.;Table 8.1 Published collision studies (reports are indicated by a) with fatality rates for different species around the world.
