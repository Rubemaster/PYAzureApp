Previous studies have suggested that differences in experimental designs and data collection protocols from one study to another contribute to the observed variability in estimates of bird deaths from collision with turbines (Morrison 2002 Smallwood 2007 Sovacool 2009 2013). Here, an overview of estimates of collision rate was obtained from 24 studies varying in scale, from a number of countries across the world (Table 8.1). Where information is presented on an individual turbine basis in the studies reviewed, it is clear that the variation in mortality between turbines is extremely wide, from 0 to 125 birds per turbine per year (the upper figure is from Everaert 2014). Some turbines are therefore particularly dangerous for birds (see Turbines, below). However, on a wind farm basis, incorporating the range between turbines, the variation is considerably lower, with a range in rates from 0 to 39 dead birds per turbine per year between areas and species in the studies referenced in Table 8.1. Using the midpoint of any studies providing a range of estimates, an overall mean1 SE collision rate of 4.351.93 birds per turbine per year was calculated.;Despite the scope for considerable variation between studies, the results of this overview compare favourably with the carcass removal experiments of Doty and Martin (2013), which suggested that the mortality rate was within the range of 0.367.7 birds per turbine per year at a single pilot turbine over one year in sub Saharan Africa. Similarly, Bull et al. (2013) suggested a mortality rate of 4.645.38 bird collisions per turbine per year in New Zealand. Of more significance, there is also reasonable agreement with the largescale study of Zimmerling et al. (2013), who estimated collision mortality using data from carcass searches for 43 wind farms comprising 2,955 turbines across Canada, incorporating correction factors for scavenger removal, searcher efficiency and carcasses that fell beyond the area searched. On average, 8.21.4 birds were killed per turbine per year at these sites, with the numbers at individual wind farms varying from 0 to 26.9 birds per turbine per year. Accordingly, it was estimated that 23,300 birds (95 confidence interval 20,000 to 28,300) would be killed from collisions with wind turbines each year. A review of bird mortality in wind farms in the contiguous USA (Loss et al. 2013) estimated that between 140,000 and 328,000 birds are killed annually at monopole turbines. Erickson et al. (2014) produced similar
