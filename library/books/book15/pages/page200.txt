(see Box 7.1). Conversely, the same authors and Bevanger et al. (2010) found breeding Dunlin to be hardly affected by the presence of wind turbines. Similarly, Ketzenberg et al. (2002) found no statistical evidence for displacement for shorebird species breeding on wet grassland in northern Germany. Niemuth et al. (2013) showed that Willet Tringa semipalmata, Marbled Godwit Limosa fedoa and Wilsons Phalarope Phalaropus tricolor still occurred on wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region in close proximity to wind farms, although they found a slight but nonsignificant decrease in density in one of the two wind farm sites they studied. Outside the breeding season, several shorebird species, including widespread and common species such as Northern Lapwing and European Golden Plover (Winkelman 1992 Schreiber 1993 Bach et al. 1999 Sinning  Gerjets 1999 Walter  Brux 1999 Bergen 2001a 2001b Reichenbach 2003), seem to be often, but not always, affected by wind farms. This result is also supported by studies employing BACI or GI designs (Table 7.5). Gulls, particularly outside the breeding season, infrequently showed signs of displacement (Table 7.5).;Table 7.4 Impacts of wind turbines on several groups of Anseriform species.;P gives the results of binomial tests (ns not significant).
