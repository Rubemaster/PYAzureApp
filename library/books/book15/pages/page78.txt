To achieve these goals, the authors consulted 36 EIA studies conducted in 14 different countries from all around the world, but mainly in Europe and the Americas, that were available online (Table 3.2). Studies were conducted in the official web pages of companies (consultants), promoters (developers) and governments. The results, presented in Table 3.3, show that the most referenced effect was the direct destruction of vegetation andor importantflora populations, mentioned in almost 89 of the studies analysed. The degradation of surrounding habitats was named in 67 of the studies, whereas the proliferation of invasive species was noted in a much lower proportion of the documents (33). Sometimes, the proliferation of invasive plants is mentioned as an effect upon fauna and the effects on native vegetation are not considered. Surprisingly, genetic pollution was one of the less referred to effects, along with soil compaction, which was mentioned in several studies, but not as an effect upon flora and vegetation (Table 3.3). Similarly, soil contamination was described in several studies, but only in four of them was it considered to have negative effects upon plant communities. A key outcome of the review was that in only 51 of studies were effects on vegetation thought likely to occur during the operational phase, and in 43 of studies they were thought to be nonexistent. Moreover, the occurrence of cumulative effects was mentioned in only 50 of the studies.;Table 3.2 List of studies consulted in a brief review of important effects and impacts upon vegetation identified in the Environmental Impact Assessment.
