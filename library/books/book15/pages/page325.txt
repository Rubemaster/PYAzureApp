Figure 10.5 Location of wolf breeding sites used during pre construction, construction and operation of Alto Minho wind farm (Melgao, Portugal) and wolf home ranges during construction and the first 2 years of operation. Home ranges are estimated by minimum convex polygons using 95 of GPS locations (MCP 95) from two resident wolves. Three phases of operation are shown (1) Operation I, the first year of operation in 2009 (2) Operation II, the second year of operation in 2010 and (3) Operation IIIVI, the third to sixth years of operation from 2011 to 2014 inclusive.;In general, habitat loss is probably the most important factor causing longterm population decline and extinctions for wildlife (Brooks et al. 2002). The direct loss of habitat from wind power development is often permanent, but in most cases constitutes a relatively small part of the landscape and the home ranges of larger terrestrial mammals. Thus, the direct habitat loss is thought unlikely to have major negative effects on populations in most cases (Arnett et al. 2007 Kuvlesky et al. 2007).;However, predictions of low or no effect from habitat loss obviously depend critically on whether crucial areas or limiting habitats are being exploited. For example, it may be important to avoid highquality grazing areas (Walter et al. 2006 Webb et al.
