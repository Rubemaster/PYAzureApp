Clearing of forests for the construction of wind farms may have several effects on bats. Treeroosting species lose roosting habitat, and species that forage in forests lose foraging habitat. Conversely,forest edges and corridors created by clearing for rows of turbines and connecting roads may create foraging habitat because some species of bats forage preferentially along edges (Verboom  Huitema 1997 Morris et al. 2010).;Draining or other changes to wetlands may also affect bats. Many species of insectivorous bats forage near or over water, and insect densities tend to be higher in such areas (e.g. Barclay 1991). In natural grasslands and agricultural lands, the footprint of turbines and associated infrastructure is relatively small, and there may be little impact on bats from wind farms in these habitats.;Roosting and hibernating bats could be disturbed by the noise and dust created during the construction of wind farms. Indeed, some jurisdictions suggest or mandate setbacks of turbines from known maternity colonies or hibernacula (e.g. Europe Rodrigues et al. 2008 2015 Canada Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2011 USA Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies 2007).;The noise from operating turbines could also disturb bats, although no data regarding this type of impact were found. The likelihood that roosting or hibernating bats would be disturbed by turbine noise seems low given that the sound generated by an operating turbine is primarily of low (sonic) frequency (e.g. Mller  Pedersen 2011) compared to bat hearing, which is most sensitive at relatively high (ultrasonic) frequencies (e.g. Neuweiler 1984). However, natural or humanmade noise can interfere with the foraging behaviour of bats (e.g. Mackey  Barclay 1989 Schaub et al. 2008 Bunkley et al. 2015), so it is possible that foraging bats may avoid areas near wind turbines.;There are two proximate causes of direct mortality of bats at wind turbines (sensu Cryan  Barclay 2009) they are struck by moving turbine blades (e.g. Horn et al. 2008 Rollins et al. 2012) or they suffer fatal internal injuries associated with barotrauma (e.g. Baerwald et al. 2008). The most common and most obvious cause of death is trauma caused by being hit by a blade that, at the tips, can move at 300 kilometres per hour or more. However, some dead bats found under or near turbines show no external evidence of traumatic injury, but when examined internally have bloodfilled lungs and chest cavities or damage to their ear drums (Baerwald et al. 2008 Brownlee  Whidden 2011 Grodsky et al. 2011 Rollins et al. 2012 Escobar et al. 2015 Voigt et al. 2015). Such injuries have been linked to barotrauma caused by a sudden change in air pressure (Baerwald et al. 2008). As with other aerofoils, moving
