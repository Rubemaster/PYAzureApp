Figure 7.7 Numbers of wind farm victims per group of species recorded in the list of the Staatliche Vogelschutzwarte Brandenburg (last updated on 11 December 2014, T. Drr, personal communication 2014) relative to an index of avoidance derived from the percentage of reviewed studies showing displacement for a group of species.;Figure 7.8 Relationship of collision index and avoidance index (see text for definitions) for groups of bird species in Germany.;The preceding text demonstrates much evidence for local displacement of birds due to wind farms. Some of the affected species have an unfavourable conservation status (BirdLife International 2004), whereas others are protected by national and international law including the European Union Birds Directive andor international conventions. To see whether displacement of birds by wind farms has a major impact on the populations of these species, the critical question of whether displacement just causes a spatial rearrangement of individuals without consequences for individual fitness or whether it influences critical components of fitness such as reproductive output and survival needs to be answered. Cumulative effects also have to be taken into account when trying to answer this question. In the context of this chapter,
