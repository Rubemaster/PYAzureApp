Another factor influencing variation in fatality rate is the height of the turbines. Older generation turbines, on short towers (50 m), kill fewer bats than taller ones (Barclay et al. 2007 Rydell et al. 2010a Geogiakakis et al. 2012). It is suggested that tall turbines have blades in the airspace occupied by more bats, or that tall turbines attract more bats.;Lastly, within wind farms, certain turbines sometimes have higher fatality rates than others. Turbines with high fatality rates may be close to features that attract bats, such as trees, canyons and cliffs, features that bats may forage near or roost in, or wetlands that are rich in insects (e.g. Piorkowski  OConnell 2010 Rydell et al. 2010b Santos et al. 2013), or they may be the first turbines encountered by migrating bats as they enter a wind farm area (e.g. Baerwald  Barclay 2011). As for birds (Kerlinger et al. 2010), aviation lights on turbines do not influence bat fatalities (Johnson et al. 2003 Horn et al. 2008 Baerwald  Barclay 2011 Bennett  Hale 2014).;As previously mentioned, estimates of annual fatality rates of bats in North America range from 196,000 to 396,000 (Arnett  Baerwald 2013), to 600,000 (Hayes 2013) and as high as 880,000 (Smallwood 2013) in the USA. In Europe, the median estimated fatality rate (n40 sites) was 2.0 bats per turbine per year, considerably lower than that for North America (n24 sites) with a median of 3.7 bats per turbine per year (Rydell et al. 2012). However, European studies have reported higher fatality rates (e.g. DubourgSavage et al. 2011 Camina 2012 Voigt et al. 2012).;As of the middle of 2015, the global installed wind energy totalled 393,000 MW World Wind Energy Association (WWEA) 2015. No estimates of the rate of bat fatalities are available for the majority of that total. However, by using the mean rate for North America and extrapolating to the global situation, a rough perception of the magnitude of the issue may be gained. As of 2011, there was a total of 52,184 MW of wind energy installed in North America (Arnett  Baerwald 2013), and an estimated 196,190 to 395,886 bats were killed in 2012. Estimates of annual fatalities in the USA range from 600,000 (Hayes 2013) to 880,000 (Smallwood 2013), over the 46,919 MW operational there. Using the low and high estimates, the extrapolated global fatality estimate for 2014 would be between 1.48 and 7.37 million bats. In Germany alone, new estimates place annual fatality rates at 300,000 (Voigt et al.
