Previous chapters in this volume outline the effects upon wildlife at a range of trophic levels from flora to invertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles, terrestrial mammals, bats and birds. This chapter aims to provide a unifying synthesis of the effects and impacts described, whilst also incorporating information from recent studies and grey literature. The collision of birds and bats and the displacement of birds have been widely studied, particularly in Europe and North America. Unfortunately, no peer reviewed studies are available from China and India, amongst the worlds major producers of wind energy. Displacement has been demonstrated for riskaverse bird species, although the mechanisms behind disturbance typically remain unclear. For some large mammals, increased human presence may be important. The consequences of displacement upon individual fitness of any species generally remain unmeasured. In contrast, a small number of longerterm intensive studies of collision mortality of raptors have demonstrated impacts upon local populations with possible consequences at larger scales. Whilst the scale of bat collisions appears considerable, judging impacts has been hampered by a lack of knowledge of population demography and dynamics. Cumulative effects upon any taxon, particularly migratory species, have barely begun to be addressed. Until further research fills knowledge gaps, the uncertainty of impacts should be embraced by avoiding conflict in the first place through careful selection of sites and turbine locations. The combination of the typical scale of habitat loss and modification during construction activity, the installation of a road network that could promote the spread of alien plants and fragment
