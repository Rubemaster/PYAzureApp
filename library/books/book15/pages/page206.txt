P gives the results of binomial tests (ns not significant). Bold figures indicate predominantly negative effects.;It is hard to measure exactly at what distance displacement from wind turbines occurs. The strength of avoidance probably follows a gradient from the edge of the wind farm to some distance outside it, with this likely to be broadly species specific. However, as previously mentioned, other factors, such as habitat quality, may mask the effects of the wind farm on the distribution of birds. Species or groupspecific avoidance distances, therefore, can be expected to vary between studies. Here, avoidance distances are taken to mean the distances from the nearest wind turbines at which changes in the distribution become clearly visible. The distances were either given by the authors or were taken as those distances at which densities of birds were at least 20 lower than the expected densities without wind farm impact.;Reported avoidance distances varied between species, but also within species between studies. In general, avoidance distances were small, such as 200 m for Northern Wheatear (PearceHiggins et al. 2009). Some species, however, consistently show high avoidance distances, especially during the nonbreeding season. These species, identified in Table 7.8 and Figure 7.3, represent the groups established as being the most wary of wind farms in the section Groups and species affected, above, including swans, geese, ducks and waders. In such species, the effect of wind farms can be noticed up to 800 m for Golden Plover (Pedersen  Poulsen 1991) and Eurasian Curlew (PearceHiggins et al. 2009). Avoidance distances
