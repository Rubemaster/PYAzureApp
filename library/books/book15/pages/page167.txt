Relative to the large and growing body of literature reporting direct mortality of birds and bats at wind farms (Kuvlesky et al. 2007 Baerwald et al. 2008 Lovich  Ennen 2013a Lovich 2015a), there are only a few published studies assessing survival and mortality of herpetofauna, with these limited to Agassizs Desert Tortoise and related to vehicle traffic and infrastructure (Lovich et al. 2011a 2011b) (Box 6.1). The effects of traffic and roads on herpetofauna are well known (Dodd et al. 2004 Steen  Gibbs 2004 Andrews et al. 2008) and the effect of roads in wind farms would be expected to be similar on a traffic rate basis (Figure 6.4). Mortality indirectly associated with wind farm infrastructure is more obscure and harder to measure. Lovich et al. (2011a) reported an entrapment mortality at Mesa wind farm (Box 6.1), where an adult male tortoise used a road culvert as a burrow surrogate. Winter precipitation filled the culvert with highly erodible sediments, entombing the tortoise and resulting in its eventual death. Even with known wind farmrelated mortalities at their study site, Lovich et al. (2011b) and Agha et al. (2015b) reported a relatively high and comparable survivorship to other desert tortoise populations in more natural habitats.;Figure 6.4 Roads are a known source of mortality for many reptiles and amphibians. This young Agassizs Desert Tortoise was observed crossing a road in a wind farm near Mojave, California, USA. Signage warning of wildlife crossing and posting slow speed limits may effectively mitigate mortality. (Katherine Gray);There is also potential for mortality of subterranean reptiles and amphibians in wind farms. Many species spend a significant portion of their annual life cycle underground to avoid thermal extremes, to nest (Box 6.1) and to hibernate. Hibernation is often conducted at
