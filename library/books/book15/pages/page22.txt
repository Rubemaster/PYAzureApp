The wind blows on the angled blades of the rotor, causing the rotor shaft to rotate and convert some of the winds kinetic energy into mechanical energy. The generator converts this mechanical energy into electrical energy. Traditional wind turbines employ a gearbox to increase the rotational speed of the rotor shaft and, therefore, the efficiency of the generator (Figure 1.2). An anemometer on top of the nacelle monitors wind speed and direction, starting the turbine when wind speeds are sufficient, the cutin speed, and shutting it down when wind speeds exceed its maximum operating speed. In general, turbines cut in at around 4 or 5 metres per second (ms) and shut down at speeds exceeding 30ms (Boyle 2004). Additional sensors can also direct (yaw) the nacelle and rotor into the wind, and pitch (feather) the blades to control energy capture.;Figure 1.2 How a wind turbine generates electricity.;A transformer at the base of the turbine converts the electricity generated by the wind turbine at around 700 volts (V) to a more typical voltage for distribution to electrical distribution networks such as 33,000 V, which is equal to 33 kilovolts (kV). Where a turbine connects to a highvoltage distribution network, usually when the turbine is part of a wind farm, buried cables transfer the medium voltage electricity to a substation where it is converted to high voltage (132275400 kV). The highvoltage electrical distribution network transmits the electricity around the country. The process of electricity generation and distribution is illustrated in Figure 1.3.
