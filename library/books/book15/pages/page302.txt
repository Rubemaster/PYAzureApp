2012 Lehnert et al. 2014). It is expected that global wind energy will increase by more than 10 per year until 2020 (WWEA 2015). Even based on the geographically limited data that are available, primarily from studies in North America and Europe, the number of bats estimated to be killed by turbines globally per year is in the millions. In addition, these fatalities are concentrated on relatively few species. In North America, as noted above, the three species of migratory bats make up the majority of all fatalities (Arnett  Baerwald 2013). Based on the range of overall estimates (Arnett  Baerwald 2013 Smallwood 2013) and their proportion of total fatalities, the estimated number of Hoary Bats killed per year is between 74,552 and 2.64 million. The estimate for Eastern Red Bats is 43,162 to 1.53 million and for Silverhaired Bats it is 35,314 to 1.25 million.;The ultimate question regarding these fatalities is whether they are numerous enough to cause declines in populations of the species of bats affected. While Erickson et al. (2015) suggested that bird fatalities at turbines in North America are unlikely to have a significant impact on passerine bird populations, this remains difficult to assess for bats because two key pieces of information are missing that might otherwise allow a population viability analysis the sizes of the populations of the species killed at turbines and the natural background mortality rate. The fact that bats are long lived and have slow reproductive rates indicates that they have low natural mortality (Barclay  Harder 2003). Although longterm monitoring of some more easily counted species in Europe has occurred and populations of the majority appear stable or increasing (Barlow et al. 2015), few data for species that are killed in large numbers at wind turbines, or from other parts of the world, are available.
