Future research aims to undertake more indepth analysis of demographic parameters and the age classes most affected by mortality, as well as to evaluate the origin of Griffon Vulturesrecovered dead. It has also been suggested that an evaluation of any changes in the population breeding in the north of Spain should be conducted, as individuals there may also be subject to mortality at the many wind farms they are likely to cross during longdistance migratory flights.;Sitespecific differences in the habitat occupied by turbines may also be equally or more important in explaining the groups and species recorded as collision victims. To illustrate the point, in coastal habitats in Belgium, some studies have found high mortality rates of nonpasserines such gulls and especially terns, comprising Common Tern Sterna hirundo, Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis and Little Tern Sternula albifrons (Everaert  Stienen 2007 Everaert  Kuijken 2007 Everaert 2014).;Longterm fatality monitoring established the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) as one of the most dangerous wind resources in the world for large raptors, but of less significance for other birds and bats (Orloff  Flannery 1992 Smallwood  Thelander 2008 Smallwood 2013). However, this perception was based on fatality search intervals longer than 30 days, which favoured finding large birds over small birds and bats. An opportunity arose to compare fatality rate estimates between two teams performing fatality searches at the same wind turbines but using different periodic intervals between searches. The opportunity was to test whether the typical monitoring methods in the APWRA were suitable for estimating fatality rates for any volant species other than large birds.;A beforeafter controlimpact (BACI) test of a new wind turbine model was designed on behalf of Ogin Inc. The before phase monitoring overlapped the more extensive monitoring performed by the Alameda County Avian MonitorICF International (ICF) at 126 40 kW Enertech and 65 kW Micon turbines that operated at three sites on the eastern side of the AWPRA. ICF had selected turbine rows randomly, whereas to maximise the size of experimental effects, clusters of wind
