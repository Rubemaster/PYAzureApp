Figure 11.8 Dead Smla Willow Ptarmigan lying at the base of the turbine, showing its flight direction and the height of its bloody point of collision above the ground. (Lars Falkdalen Lindahl);Ptarmigan. To confirm this view, all Willow Ptarmigan flushed either during radiotracking or during spring and autumn censuses (Bevanger et al. 2010) were given an estimated flight height of higher or lower than 15 metres above the ground. During the period from April 2008 to December 2010 a total of 142 flight heights of Willow Ptarmigan were registered, with 138 (97) of these below 15 metres. There was no difference between the wind farm and a control area at Smla. Hence, it seems unlikely that Ptarmigan at Smla are in danger of colliding with rotor blades. A similar tendency to collide with the turbine tower and not the rotors has been recorded for Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix in the Alps (Zeiler  GrnschachnerBerger 2009).
