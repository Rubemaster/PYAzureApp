Millidine et al. (2015) demonstrated that wind farm projects can be constructed without resulting in significant adverse effects onaquatic organisms. Other studies have also demonstrated that water quality in local watercourse can be protected during largescale construction projects. For example, Purcell et al. (2012) found that the measures taken at the planning, design and construction stages of a major motorway scheme in Ireland were successful in minimising the water quality impacts associated with the road scheme crossing these watercourses. It is clear that largescale wind energy projects can also be constructed without significantly affecting aquatic areas. However, if mitigation is required, this must be effective and monitored for compliance (Figure 5.6).;Figure 5.6 Mitigation has to be effective and monitored for compliance. Here, loose straw bales have been installed in a stream draining a wind farm construction site to operate as a silt trap. It is difficult to see how this could function as intended. (William OConnor);Despite potential significant adverse effects, most of the conflicts between wind farms and the aquatic environment can potentially be avoided or mitigated through careful project design and management. This is partly because the overall footprint of a wind farm is usually relatively small. It is already recognised that wind energy developments can bring local biodiversity benefits (EC 2011), and it is possible that the development of a wind farm instigating suitable water quality protection mitigation could bring longterm benefits to the receiving aquatic environment, particularly on sites that are already disturbed and have existing erosion issues. Research is needed, however, and there is an almost complete absence of pre and postconstruction studies in relation to
