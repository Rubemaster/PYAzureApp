Overall, the comparison of data on growth, demography andsurvivorship of tortoises in the wind farm with the wider literature (Ernst  Lovich 2009) on G. agassizii and G. morafkai in natural areas by Lovich et al. (2011b) showed population density, sex ratio and size distribution, and other parameters for Mesa were generally within the range of values reported elsewhere. There was some evidence of slower growth rates for males and high estimated annual survivorship of females (see Esque et al. 2010 for comparisons), but with no obvious effect on what was considered to be a stable population.;Unfortunately, it is still not clear whether wind farm development may be generally compatible with the conservation of G. agassizii or not. Lovich and Daniels (2000) suggested that the protected nature of the Mesa site confers an advantage on the G. agassizii population living within it, as even though turbines are located on public land administered by the US Bureau of Land Management, access by the general public is greatly restricted through the use of landuse plans, fencing, locked gates and No trespassing signs. Protective fencing greatly limits vandalism (Berry 1986) and illegal collection of tortoises (Grandmaison  Frary 2012), conferring an added level of protection to tortoises and other wildlife (Brooks 1995 1999 Berry et al. 2014). Conversely, site operations have resulted in mortality and injury to tortoises, ranging from a road strike of a gravid female (Lovich et al. 2011b) to entrapment in road culverts (Lovich et al. 2011a) and injury from fire (Lovich et al. 2011c).;Moreover, the findings to date must be placed in the context of the population dynamics of a species that takes about 1415 years to reach maturity (Germano 1994) and has a generation time of about 25 years (Edwards et al. 2004). As a result, the duration of this study (19972013) has yet to span a single generation time. Shortterm studies of longlived species are rarely adequate for understanding processes that occur over long periods (Callahan 1984). Accordingly, after the accumulation of thousands of tortoise captures and recaptures, including at burrow locations, over the longer term (approximately 20 years), it now appears that tortoises generally avoid the areas of greatest turbine and road concentration at the site (Lovich 2015b). As such, the initial promising shortterm effects on burrow location have not been realised in the longer term. Moreover, there has been limited recruitment into the adult population since 2000, even though Mesa tortoises are fecund (Lovich et al. 2015), clutches are
