Figure 11.7 Radiotagged Smla Willow Ptarmigan. Birds were captured during the winter from November to March on nights with no moonlight, by using strong lights to dazzle the bird on the ground to allow a net on a long pole to be quickly placed over it before it escaped. (Sten Svartaas);In the threeyear study, the 34 radiomarked Willow Ptarmigan were monitored for the equivalent of 54 birdyears. Six birds (17.6) were still alive at the end of the study period. Thus, the sample for our mortality analyses was based on 28 birds. Of the birds lost, 57 (n16) died as a result of avian predation, with 32 (n9) placed in the collision category. The last category, other 11 (n  3), contained Ptarmigan that died of undetermined causes. However, none of the individuals categorised as killed as a result of collision with windturbines was found at the base of the turbines. Hence, it is difficult to quantify with certainty how many of the birds were actually killed through collision and not by predators. But with no clear signs of predation it was assumed that after colliding with turbines most dead Ptarmigan were moved by scavengers such as corvids (Bevanger et al. 2010). Indeed, during regular searches with dogs in the wind farm several unmarked Willow Ptarmigan were found at the base of turbines (Figure 11.8), with typical signs of collision (such as fractured bones and internal bleeding) when autopsied (Bevanger et al. 2010).
