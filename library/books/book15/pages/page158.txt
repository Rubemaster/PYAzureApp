Only two research projects explicitly investigate the effects of wind farms on reptiles and amphibians, including the present authors ongoing longterm research on Agassizs Desert Tortoise Gopherus agassizii in the USA (Box 6.1) (e.g. Lovich  Daniels 2000 Lovich et al. 2011a 2011b 2011c 2012 2015 Ennen et al. 2012a Agha et al. 2015a) and the work of Santos et al. (2010) assessing the responses of a community of reptiles and amphibians to wind farmdevelopment in Portugal (Box 6.2). Following Lovich and Ennen (2013a), potential impacts are discussed, based on a foundation of supporting information designed to reduce speculation. Because absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence, identification of potential effects at the very least provides a series of testable hypotheses for future research.;Agassizs Desert Tortoise Gopherus agassizii (Figure 6.1) is a conservationreliant species listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act in 1990. It occurs in both the Mojave and Sonoran deserts of the USA in portions of Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah (Ernst  Lovich 2009). Continuing threats to G. agassizii include habitat destruction and modification (Lovich  Bainbridge 1999), climate change (Lovich et al. 2014c), disease and predation, overutilisation, the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and renewable energy development (USFWS 2011). Wind farms could affect G. agassizii populations by further fragmenting what was once a largely continuous historical range of the species across wide areas of suitable habitat, broken only by major topographic features with unsuitable habitat (AverillMurray et al. 2013) and the historical effects of drought (Morafka 1994 Lovich et al. 2014c). The protected status of G. agassizii impacts on resource management decisions, including where to site and how to mitigate renewable energy projects (Lovich  Ennen 2011 2013a), and has led to increased research effort. Gopherus agassizii is now one of the best studied turtles in the USA (Lovich  Ennen 2013b). Much of that research may be of relevance to the closely related Morafkas Desert Tortoise G. morafkai that occurs in the US and Mexican parts of the Sonoran Desert (Ernst  Lovich 2009 Murphy et al. 2011).
