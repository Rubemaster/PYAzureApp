Elzay et al. in Chapter 4 of the potential large scale of bottomup foodweb effects that may be initiated by wind farm operation, cascading upwards to higher trophic levels including reptiles and amphibians, birds and mammals. It should also be noted that any changes in microclimate within a wind farm could directly affect ecothermic animals, including invertebrates and reptiles and amphibians (Lovich  Ennen, Chapter 6).;Figure 11.12 Ground Squirrels Spermophilus beecheyi in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area prefer short grass. A lack of management promoting taller vegetation may discourage squirrels and, in turn, one of their main predators, Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos, possibly making the birds less vulnerable to collision.
