 Stage 1  Screening The process of identifying the likely impacts of a project upon a European site, either alone or in combination with other plans and projects, and considering whether the impacts are likely to be significant. If likely significant effects cannot be discounted, Stage 2 must be undertaken.; Stage 2  Appropriate assessment The consideration of the impacts on the integrity of the European site, either alone or in combination with other plans and projects, with regard to the sites structure and function and its conservation objectives. Where likely significant effects are identified, an assessment of mitigation options must be carried out to determine adverse effects on the integrity of the site. If these mitigation options cannot avoid adverse effects then development consent can only be given if Stages 3 and 4 are followed.; Stage 4  Imperative reasons of overriding public interest (IROPI) Consideration of whether a development is necessary IROPI is undertaken where no alternative solution exists and where adverse impacts remain. If it is decided that the development should be permitted for IROPI, potential compensatory measures needed to maintain the overall coherence of the site or integrity of the European site network will need to be identified. Generally, there is a requirement to ensure that the compensation works satisfactorily before construction of the development can begin.
