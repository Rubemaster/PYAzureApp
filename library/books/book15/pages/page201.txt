Figure 7.1 Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis avoid wind farms when on their wintering grounds, but may be more tolerant of them at other times of year. (Hermann Htker);As a result of their high collision rates (see Chapter 8 in this volume), raptors (Accipitriformes and Falconiformes) have been the focus of many research studies, providing the opportunity to test for displacement. By definition, species that collide with turbines at high rates, such as vultures, and some eagles, do not actively avoid wind farms (Thelander et al. 2003 de Lucas et al. 2004 Hull  Muir 2013). Therefore, many studies showed that raptors were not disturbed, or were only slightly disturbed by wind farms. For example, Straer (2006) found that Red Kite Milvus milvus (Figure 7.2), Black Kite Milvus migrans, Common Buzzard Buteo buteo and Common Kestrel did not show any avoidance behaviour towards wind farms, although Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus seemed to be displaced to some extent. A telemetry study of Red Kite by Mammen et al. (2014) yielded a similar lack of effect, and summarising studies of Hen Harriers Circus cyaneus, Whitfield and Madders (2006) concluded that displacement (on a small scale) due to wind farms was recorded in only one of eight studies. Similarly, Grajetzky and Nehls (2014), Joest et al. (2014) and Rasran and Thomsen (2014) did not find statistical evidence for displacement of Montagus Harrier Circus pygargus in Germany. Nonetheless, there is some evidence for displacement of raptors, such as that documented
