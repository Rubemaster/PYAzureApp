On the island of Smla, midNorway, a 68turbine, 150 MW wind power plant is in conflict with a population of White tailed Eagles Halieeatus albicilla (WTEs) breeding at high density (Figure 8.7). The approximately 50pair WTE population within the whole Smla area has been closely monitored, including monitoring of DNA profiles from adult birds in the breeding territories. Before construction, 1012 pairs of WTEs were breeding within the wind farm, and this number has been reduced to 4 pairs. Searches for collision fatalities during the period 20052012 found 49 WTEs under the turbines.;WTE territories close to the wind farm experienced reduced breeding success in the postconstruction period compared to preconstruction. The effect is both to due mortality and the displacement of birds from their territories within the wind farm. Also, survival rates among both subadult and adult birds are lower for birds originating close to the turbines (5 km) than for those from farther away. The combination of reduced reproductive output and reduced survival rates has led to a reduction in population growth rate, with the subpopulation breeding close to the wind farm being most negatively affected. The subpopulation within 5 km currently experiences negative growth (1) with a replacement rate (net reproductive rate, R ) below 1 ( is the rate of growth, the ratio of population size at the end of one interval). Generation time is decreased with decreasing distance to turbines and the population more than 5 km from the wind farm displays positive growth.
