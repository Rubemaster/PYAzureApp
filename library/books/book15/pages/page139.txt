Figure 5.4 A landslide associated with wind farm construction works (2005) completely changed this watercourse in County Galway, Ireland. (William OConnor);Fluvial geomorphology is the process of water and sediment flows in a river catchment, and the landforms produced by these processes (Sear et al. 2003). It is related to, and includes an interaction of, the themes of hydrology, physical habitat and the sediment section of the water quality theme. Any changes in hydrology and erosion will affect fluvial geomorphology to some extent, and such changes can occur as a result of the construction or upgrading of wind farm site access roads or, for example, forestry works associated with the preparation of a proposed wind farm site. The effects of road construction on fluvial geomorphology are well documented (e.g. Forman et al. 2003). There is also a significant amount of literature describing the similar impacts of forestry operations (e.g. Hartman et al. 1996 Jones  Grant 1996). Roads and culverts can interrupt natural sediment flows in streams, depriving downstream areas of bedload material. Increased erosion can result in an oversupply and accumulation of sediment in watercourses, leading to habitat loss through filling of pools and riffles. Although many of the above effects are likely to be minor or localised, as reported above, landslides have occurred as a result of wind farm construction (Figure 5.4), which have had largescale geomorphic impacts.
