The significance of a potential impact is determined by considering sensitivity against the predicted magnitude of changewithin a matrix (Table 1.5). Assigning magnitude generally considers the extent, duration, frequency and severity of a potential effect, and whether the change is predicted to be permanent or temporary in nature. In Table 1.5, a receptor with a medium sensitivity exposed to a potential impact with a substantial magnitude of change will result in a major significant impact, be it adverse or beneficial. In the context of ecological impact assessment, CIEEM defines significance in terms of an impact (negative or positive) on the integrity of a defined site or ecosystem andor the conservation status of habitats or species within a given geographical area (CIEEM 2006). In general, impacts of moderate or major significant are unacceptable, whereas impacts of negligible or minor significance may be tolerated. Given that an impact assessment methodology is often receptor specific, it is good policy to agree receptorspecific methodologies and definitions of significance with the regulator and stakeholders at the EIA scoping stage and describe the different methodologies employed in the Environmental Statement (ES).;Table 1.5 An example of an impact assessment matrix used to determine impact significance. (Reproduced from Scottish Natural Heritage 2013);In addition to the potential impacts resulting from a proposed project, developers are required to consider the potential cumulative impacts with other existing and reasonable, foreseeable planned wind farm projects and other relevant anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, there is an increasing requirement for consideration of transboundary impacts, particularly between European member states.;An important step in the project design process for a wind farm is consideration of how the proposal might be adapted through mitigating measures that reduce andor minimise impacts of an unacceptable level. CIEEM (2006) advises that priority should be given to the avoidance of impacts at source, whether through the redesign of a project or by regulating the timing or location of activities. If it is not possible to avoid significant negative impacts, consideration should be given to ways of minimising the impacts by changes to design, timing or working practices, ideally to the point
