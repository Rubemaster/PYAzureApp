A beforeafter controlimpact (BACI) test of a new wind turbine model was designed on behalf of Ogin Inc. The before phase monitoring overlapped the more extensive monitoring performed by the Alameda County Avian MonitorICF International (ICF) at 126 40 kW Enertech and 65 kW Micon turbines that operated at three sites on the eastern side of the AWPRA. ICF had selected turbine rows randomly, whereas to maximise the size of experimental effects, clusters of windturbines were randomly selected from a pool of wind turbines documented to have caused the highest avian fatality rates measured in the APWRA during 20052009. The period of monitoring overlap was 1 April 2012 to 31 January 2013, or 11 months. The Ogin search interval averaged less than 5 days and the ICF interval averaged 40 days.;The methods of Smallwood (2013) were used to adjust the number of fatalitiesMW from both teams for the proportions of fatalities not found due to the effects of carcass persistence, searcher detection and maximum search radius. This relied on the national average (meanSE) searcher detection rates on annual grasslands of 0.4490.104 for bats, 0.6030.037 for small birds, 0.6750.080 for mediumsized birds and 0.7110.038 for large birds. The national average carcass persistence rates for the associated carcass size class and average search interval using the lookup tables in Smallwood (2013) were also used. Similarly, the mean proportion of carcasses found within the search interval of 50 m at wind turbine tower heights ranging 18.5 m to 24.6 m, which was 0.920.186, was also used.;Compared to the 40day interval, the fatality rates estimated from the search interval of less than 5 days were greater by 1.8 times for Burrowing Owl, 1.9 times for Common PigeonRock Dove, 3.2 times for Western Meadowlark, 2.3 times for all raptors and 4.2 times for all indigenous birds combined (Table 8.4). Also compared to the 40day interval, the searches at intervals of less than 5 days detected 20 additional species, or 3.33 times more species. All of the fatalities discovered by ICF had been found by Ogin.;The species found by Ogin but not by ICF were disproportionately small bodied. The proportion of fatalities mutually discovered by Ogin and ICF increased rapidly with increasing body mass typical of the species up to birds the size of Common Pigeons (Table 8.4). Searches performed every 40 days found only 2 (7.7) of 26 birds weighing less than 78 g, equivalent to birds smaller than European Starlings. The longer interval searches found only half of the eight birds weighing 1080 g or more, equivalent to birds at least the size of Red tailed Hawks.
