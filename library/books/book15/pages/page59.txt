Measuring the effects of turbines on microclimate and hence ecosystem functioning requires measurements of the factors described in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2. Such measurements are made with flux stations, as shown in Figure 2.3. A caveat in all the studies described in the previous section is that none reported in situ measurements of microclimate (even in situ air temperatures) within wind farms when crops or other plant communities were known to be growing and turbines were known to be operating. Based on discussions with agronomists, Takle (2012) (website cited by Armstrong et al. 2014) itemised a list of potential impacts that turbines could have on crops, and specifically identified daytime maximum temperatures, nighttime temperatures, evaporation (moisture fluxes), CO2 fluxes, pressure pumping of CO2 from the soil, plant movement (momentum fluxes) and mesoscale surface convergence as potential microclimate and mesoscale influences of wind farms (Table 2.1).;Figure 2.3 Flux measurement station (left), with further detail of the sonic anemometer for measuring turbulence in three dimensions (right). In the case of Rajewski et al. (2013), turbulent fluctuations of the wind were calculated from measurements, taken 20 times per second, of the difference in soundwave travel time between each pair of ports of the sonic anemometer.;Table 2.1 Potential impact of turbines on crops as suggested by informal discussions with 15 plant physiologists, soil physicists, soil chemists, plant pathologists, photosynthesis experts and extension agricultural climatologists (qualitative assessments only data on magnitude of effects are lacking).
