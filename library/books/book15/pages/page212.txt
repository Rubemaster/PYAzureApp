Drr 2014). Although the data for the list of collision victims in Germany (called the collision list hereafter) have only partly been collected systematically and, therefore, include only a small and unknown fraction of all victims, they give some indication of the species mostly affected by collisions.;The number of victims listed per species depends on many factors, including the population size of the species in Germany. As the collision list does not distinguish between seasons, population sizes both in the breeding season and in migration and wintering periods are relevant. In Germany, whereas the population sizes of breeding birds and wintering waterbirds are well known (Sudfeldt et al. 2013), this is the not the case for other groups of species in other seasons. To keep things simple, a class of the order of magnitude (199, 100 999, 1,0009,999, 10,00099,999, 100,000999,999, 1,000,0009,999,999, 10,000,00099,999,999) was assigned to each of those species occurring in Germany and with a record in the database on displacement. Population sizes (individuals) were taken from Hppop et al. (2013) and Sudfeldt et al. (2013). To be able to use the population size in calculations, the harmonic mean of the class was taken as the national population size. For each species, an index of collision risk (hereinafter the collision index) was determined by dividing the number of listed collision victims (collision list last updated on 11 December 2014, T. Drr, personal communication 2014) by the harmonic mean of the population size class. The resultant numbers were scaled by 10,000 to provide a more meaningful scale.;Figure 7.5 Number of wind farm victims recorded in the list of the Staatliche Vogelschutzwarte Brandenburg (last updated on 11 December 2014, T.
