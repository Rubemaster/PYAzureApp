Chapter 1) should weed out any significant deleterious effects and or lead to effective mitigation that aims to limit potential effects to an acceptable level. Where a protected species or site is involved an even more stringent assessment, such as Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) in Europe (see EU 2001) may be adopted. HRA has at its core a test of the effect upon the integrity of an internationally important site or sites designated under the Habitats (EU 1992) or Birds Directives (EU 2009).;Figure 11.1 Immature Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos in the APWRA in California. Smallwood  Thelander (2008) estimated a mean of 67 Golden Eagles were being killed annually by turbines in the area. (Shawn Smallwood);In the face of the inevitable uncertainty of any prediction, there is an expectation that the best scientific evidence be applied using the best available methods. As such, the assessment may be judged against the criterion of reasonable scientific doubt and with the adoption of the precautionary principle. The latter in particular is difficult to define and the level of precaution adopted may vary considerably according to the perceived sensitivity of the receptor species, perhaps with further influence of the context of the site and its stakeholders. To this end, it could be argued that no wind farm currently going through a consent process should ultimately present a serious threat to wildlife. Exceptions may include projects of inherent national (or international) significance where they may be
