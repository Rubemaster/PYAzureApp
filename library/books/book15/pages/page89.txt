A monitoring programme was developed in Serra da Lous wind farm, located in a mountain area in central Portugal. Currently, this wind farm has 20 turbines distributed over about 10 km. During the Environmental Impact Assessment phase, the presence of two invasive alien species, Acacia dealbata (Figure 3.6) and Acacia melanoxylon, was detected within the project area and its surroundings. Accordingly, the potential propagation of these species following construction was identified as an important negative impact, as it is known that the creation of open spaces favours the spread of alien species. A seed bank of these species was thought likely to greatly influence the evolution of the vegetation after wind farm construction. This motivated the establishment of a floral monitoring programme that began in 2006 before construction in 2009, and extended into the operational phase until 2013.;Figure 3.6 An individual of the invasive plant Acacia dealbata growing in the project area of the Serra da Lous 2 wind farm in Portugal. (Bio3);The programme comprised the characterisation of the area of future placement of wind farm infrastructure (access, turbines, substation, etc.) and the immediate surroundings. Regular systematic searches were undertaken, the location of all alien species was recorded with Global Positioning System (GPS) in the field and the number of individuals of each species was estimated (Passos et al. 2012 Bio3 2014).;The data collected showed that 3 years after construction in 2009, the number of stands and the number of individuals of invasive species had increased considerably (Figure 3.7). The invasive species were observed to be spreading along the wind
