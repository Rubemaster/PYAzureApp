Several authors have suggested that turbines kill more or different bats than expected by random encounters because bats are attracted to them (Kunz et al. 2007 Horn et al. 2008 Cryan  Barclay 2009 Rydell et al. 2010b Cryan et al. 2014). Their hypotheses include; Insects accumulate at, or are attracted to, turbines and this attracts foraging insectivorous bats (Kunz et al. 2007 Rydell et al. 2010b).;Various sounds attract bats, including the echolocation and social calls of other bats (e.g. Barclay 1982 Hill  Greenaway 2005) and insect sounds (e.g. Faure  Barclay 1992). The sounds of operating turbines are mostly low frequency, but could potentially attract bats from a considerable distance. Insectivorous bats also respond to, and are attracted by, the movement of insects (e.g. Barclay  Brigham 1994), and the movement of turbine blades may attract bats visually from a distance, or via echolocation at closer range.;Although the hypotheses that bats are attracted by the sound, movement or other features of turbines have not been tested directly, thermal imaging of bats interacting with turbines shows individuals closely approaching turbine towers, nacelles and blades (Horn et al. 2008 Cryan et al. 2014). Bats did not appear to focus their approaches on those parts of turbines from which noise emanates, such as the nacelle (Horn et al. 2008 Cryan et al. 2014), suggesting that if attraction was initially to sound, it was not responsible for the close encounters that bats had with turbines. Close approaches to turbines were most common when the wind speed was low and the blades were moving slowly or not at all, and bats investigated nonmoving blades and towers (Horn et al. 2008 Cryan et al. 2014 Rydell  Wickman 2015). These studies could only observe bats within approximately 50 m of turbines, so longer distance reaction to the turbines could not be assessed.
