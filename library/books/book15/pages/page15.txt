This chapter discusses the technological aspects of wind power the policy, planning and statutory requirements underpinning its deployment and the development process from site selection through to permit award, mitigation and monitoring. While this chapter presents a global perspective, many of the examples provided have a European focus drawn from the authors own experiences in developing wind farms in the UK. Research for the chapter was undertaken through a literature review of academic papers, government and industry reports and grey literature. The review found that policy support worldwide has led to the construction of wind farms in more than 90 countries and a contribution of around 3 to the renewable energy mix globally, but with much higher contributions in areas where there is a good wind resource. Large threebladed horizontalaxis wind turbines continue to dominate commercial wind farms, but deployment of small to mediumsized turbines for domestic and rural applications is increasing, in addition to the use of verticalaxis wind turbines in urban locations. The focus of Environmental Impact Assessment as a key stage in the development process is discussed and the importance of robust site selection is highlighted as mitigation against potential environmental impacts.
