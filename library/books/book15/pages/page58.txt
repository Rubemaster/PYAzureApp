Wider scale studies of regional and global impacts of wind farms are mostly limited to reports of remotely sensed nearby surface temperature differences and modelling studies of regional and global weather patterns attributable to wind farms. For example, satellitebased remotely sensed surface radiating temperatures in regions containing wind farms are reported by Zhou et al. (2012) for west central Texas, WalshThomas et al. (2012) for the much smaller San Gorgonia Pass wind farm in California and Harris et al. (2014) over Iowa. The study by Zhou et al. (2012) over the period 20032011 was conducted in an area where four of the worlds largest wind farms are located. The land surface temperature reported was derived from surface emission and was closely related to land surface radiative properties. A statistically significant temperature difference of about 1C within the wind farm compared to surrounding regions at night (2230 and 0130 LST) was found, but warming during the daytime (1030 and 1330 LST) was much weaker. Zhou et al. (2012) also reported satellite measurements of a statistically significant nighttime warming trend of up to 0.72C per decade over the years that the wind farm was built, compared to surrounding regions with no wind farms. In a followon paper, Zhou et al. (2013) reported seasonal land surface temperature anomalies for the same Texas location and times as the previous paper, derived from moderateresolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra and Aqua satellites. In this paper, they found a warming effect of 0.310.70C during nighttime for the nineyear period in all seasons, although the warming was larger in summer than spring and autumn (fall). Consistent with their earlierstudy, daytime temperature changes were within the level of background noise in the data.;Harris et al. (2014) applied the satellitebased measurement method reported by Zhou et al. (2012 2013) to five wind farms in Iowa. They compared nighttime (2230 LST) wind farm land surface temperature anomalies (differences from outside the wind farm) after wind farm construction with preconstruction anomalies in all seasons for the period 20032013. In all wind farms, a summertime relative warming effect of 0.120.44C in June, July and August that was spatially collocated with the turbines was observed. Results aggregated over spring and autumn revealed similar results, but winter plots had high uncertainty and essentially no anomaly in the land surface temperature. In addition, the night time (2230 LST) warming signal from the wind farm was strongest in summer and also in the centre of the wind farms, with weaker warming towards the edges. When Harris et al. (2014) examined changes at times other than 2230 LST they found, in contrast to the results of Zhou et al. (2012 2013) in Texas, that Iowa wind farms showed no cooling during the daytime. The nighttime warming at 0130 LST was weaker than earlier in the evening (2230 LST), supporting an interpretation that, rather than warming the land surface, wind farms are simply suppressing the normal nocturnal cooling earlier in the evening, more so than later at night.;WalshThomas et al. (2012) used data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper to measure 0945 LST land surface temperatures upwind and downwind of the San Gorgonio Pass wind farm for summer and winter episodes from 1984 to 2011. The Thematic Mapper provided data with 240 km resolution, compared to the 1 km resolution data of MODIS. Radiating temperatures downwind (some reaching 50C) were higher than concurrent values upwind. However, the complexity of the terrain, unreported wind direction at hub height and operational status of the turbines during the periods of satellite images limited the ability of the study to attribute the observed surface warming to the operation of the wind turbines.
