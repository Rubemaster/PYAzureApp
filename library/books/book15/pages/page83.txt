Moreover, indirect damage may be caused because developments have not taken sufficient account of the underlying hydrology of the peatland. So, while the actual amount of peat lost may be small, the damage caused to the natural drainage system of the peat through drainage ditches, and so on, may have repercussions over a much wider area and can ultimately lead to the deterioration of a more significant area of peatland and other related habitats, such as streams and other watercourses located downstream. Construction of a wind farm at Derrybrien in Ireland triggered a major earth movement which eventually affected 70 ha of very wet blanket bog and conifer plantation, releasing a very large volume of liquid peat into a narrow watercourse, damaging bridges, closing roads and probably eliminating the local fishery. In the future, geotechnical risk assessments are likely to be required for all wind farm developments sited on deep peat.;Figure 3.4 Example of soil compaction in a Portuguese wind farm. (Bio3);Habitat fragmentation is often defined as a process during which a large expanse of habitat is transformed into a number of smaller patches of smaller total area, isolated from each other by a matrix of habitats, unlike the original. The negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity (both flora and fauna) are well known (Wilcove et al. 1984 Fahrig 2003). One of the problems with
