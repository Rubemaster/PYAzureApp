Cryan et al. 2014). Whether they react at greater distances and avoid wind turbines, and thus potentially suitable foraging sites or migratory routes, remains to be determined, although an unpublished study provided evidence of bats moving towards wind turbines from several hundred metres away (R. Larkin, personal communication 2015).;Both bats and birds are killed at turbines primarily by being struck by moving blades. However, some bats are killed via barotrauma, internal injuries caused by a sudden drop in air pressure as bats fly through zones of low pressure around moving blades. This has not been documented for birds, perhaps because of the significant difference between the respiratory systems of birds and mammals, including bats (Baerwald et al. 2008).;Bat fatalities at turbines are highly seasonal, being concentrated during autumn, at the time that migrating species are moving (Arnett et al. 2008 Rydell et al. 2012). Although the timing of bird fatalities is more variable, depending on the species and location (Rydell et al. 2012 Marques et al. 2014), with the exception of raptors, the majority of fatalities appears to be of resident species, or migratory species on their summering grounds, not migrating individuals (Erickson et al. 2014).;While the initial focus regarding wildlife fatalities at turbines was on birds (e.g. Howell  DiDonato 1991 Osborn et al. 2000 Barrios  Rodriguez 2004 Drewitt  Langston 2006), with some notable exceptions such as Altamont Pass in California, USA (Smallwood 2013), bat fatalities now outnumber bird fatalities at most wind farms in North America and many in Europe, often by a large margin. Estimates by Smallwood (2013) suggest that the annual fatality rate of bats in the USA (880,000) is larger than the estimate for birds (573,000).;While the greater number of bat fatalities compared to bird fatalities should be a concern, those fatalities also occur among a small number of bat species compared to fatalities of birds. For example, at a wind facility in Maryland, USA, 262 bird fatalities were spread among 46 species, while 706 bat fatalities occurred among only eight species (Young et al. 2012). Across Canada, fatalities at wind farms included 145 species of birds, while only nine species of bats were represented, despite more than twice the number of fatalities at 4,020 bats versus 1,744 birds (Bird Studies Canada 2014).
