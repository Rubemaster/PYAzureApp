Figure 8.3 Number of breeding pairs (left axis) in relation to annual mortality rate with turbines (right axis) of soaring birds (raptors and White Stork) in the study area during the breeding season.;A comparison of annual mortality rates and number of pairs estimated in the study area during the breeding season was used to assess the potential negative impact of mortality due to collision with turbines (Figure 8.3). Although Griffon Vulture has been the most frequently killed species to date, the mortality rates of Booted Eagle, Common Kestrel and Montagus Harrier were among the highest relative to the number of breeding pairs in the study area. While Booted Eagle and Common Kestrel are not of conservation concern in Spain, Montagus Harrier is a vulnerable species at the national level. Further research is required to determine whether deaths due
