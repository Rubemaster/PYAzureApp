Figure 11.13 A Hoary Bat Lasiurus cinereus fatality at a wind farm in the USA. The increased carrion load around some wind farms may bring in scavenging mammals, birds and invertebrates. For scavenging birds such as Red Kite Milvus milvus, one of the most frequent victims at wind farms in central Europe, this could conceivably enhance collision risk and further exacerbate carrion loading. (Michael Shirmacher, Bat Conservation International);Wind farms may induce a number of topdown or bottomup effects cascading to other trophic levels through a diverse range of mechanisms. Reduction of bird density either through collision (see above) or displacement (see above) may benefit their invertebrate or vertebrate prey such as rodents. Winder et al. (2014) suggest displacement of mammalian carnivores benefited Greater Prairie Chicken. Conversely, the provision of particular habitats within wind farms may increase invertebrates, small birds (Figure 11.6) or mammals (Figure 11.11), which in turn attract their predators. The attraction of bats to insects attracted to wind farms is one of several mechanisms suggested to cause bat collision (Barclay et al., Chapter 9). Thelander  Smallwood (2007) described increased densities of rodents (Figure 11.12) and lagomorphs within wind farms as a result of habitat provision in the form of rockpiles and turbine bases, which attracted raptors that may then have been at risk of collision. This subsequently led to the idea of managing habitats to discourage rodents, and thus raptors, from entering wind farms
