Marques et al. (2014) and May et al. (2015), who have summarised the knowledge so far about avian mortality and mitigation measures that may be adopted. The consensus of opinion within the scientific community from these studies seems to be that the principal causes of collision are species specific, linked to wind turbine design and influenced by topography, although other as yet unknown factors may also be at work. The sequential discussion of different factors in the Themes below attempts to tease out their relative effect, bearing in mind that mortality may also be affected by a combination of different factors.;Not all species that inhabit the same area have the same probability of collision with turbines, and many authors (Orloff et al. 1992 Thelander et al. 2003 Drewitt  Langston 2006 Htker et al. 2006 de Lucas et al. 2008 Smallwood et al. 2009 Ferrer et al. 2012 Zimmerling et al. 2013 Erickson et al. 2014 Everaert 2014) have suggested that various speciesspecific factors are of central importance in bird collision (see Speciesspecific factors, below). Reviews published in the 2010s, including those by Kerlinger et al. (2010), Loss et al. (2013), Zimmerling et al. (2013) and Erickson et al. (2014), all focused on the high variety of species affected by collisions with wind turbines and the range of different mortality rates around the USA and Canada.;Nevertheless, it has generally been noted that birds of prey are more prone to collision with wind turbines than other groups of birds (Table 8.1), including in the USA (Orloff  Flannery 1992, 1993 Nelson  Curry 1995 Hunt 1998 2002 Morrison et al. 1998 Morrison 2002 Smallwood  Thelander 2004 2008), Germany (Htker et al. 2006 Htker 2008), Spain (Lekuona  Ursa 2007 de Lucas et al. 2008 Farfn et al. 2009 Ferrer et al. 2012), Norway (Bevanger et al. 2008) and the UK (Madders  Whitfield 2006). This conclusion is typically based on the numbers of dead birds recovered. For example, the most frequent collision victims in a national collision database in Germany are Common Buzzard Buteo buteo, Red Kite and Whitetailed Eagle. However, if population size is taken into account, then it is Whitetailed Eagle that appears to be the most vulnerable, with Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina also prominent (see Box 8.1). Similarly, in Spain, Griffon Vulture, Common Kestrel and Shorttoed Eagle have the highest mortality
