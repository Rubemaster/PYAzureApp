Displacement due to disturbance is one of the key threats to birds posed by onshore wind farms. This chapter summarises the knowledge on this issue, gathered from a review of the existing literature. The most severely affected groups of species were Anseriformes (swans, geese and ducks) and Charadriiformes (particularly shorebirds). All other groups of birds seemed to be less affected, although there were exceptions. Taxonomic and ecological groups of birds that suffered from displacement due to wind farms did not usually suffer strongly from collision mortality. Species showing high avoidance nearly all occurred in open landscapes such as grasslands, farmland and open wetlands. However, for hardly any species were the results completely consistent between studies, with factors such as habitat type masking the impact of wind farms. Some species were seemingly attracted by wind farms or, more likely, by new habitats that had become available through the construction of the wind farm and its infrastructure. For the majority of species, there was a tendency for stronger wind farm avoidance during the nonbreeding season than during the breeding season. In most species displacement took place on a small scale, usually up to 200 m from the turbines, but in sensitive species avoidance extended up to 800 m. A few species showed habituation towards wind farms in the sense that avoidance distances decreased with time after construction. In most cases, taller turbines had greater impacts. Barrier effects of wind farms were reported for many bird species, but the results were often not consistent between studies. Studies conducted so far revealed much evidence for local displacement of several bird species. Owing to a lack of studies on cumulative effects of wind farms there is no evidence for populationwide effects of displacement. To avoid damage to
