A second phase from 2009 to 2013 investigated more aspects of the ecology of tortoises in the wind farm compared to populations in more natural habitats and confirmed the importance of interannual variations in temperature (Agha et al. 2015a) and precipitation (Ennen et al. 2012b) on the behaviour and clutch phenology (Lovich et al. 2012) of tortoises. Nesting behaviour did not differ appreciably from that of populations living outside wind farms (Ennen et al. 2012a Lovich et al. 2014b). Nest sites were mostly found inside tortoise burrows but there was no evidence that nests were located in proximity to anthropogenic features of the wind farmlandscape as suggested for burrows (Ennen et al. 2012a). Female tortoises were observed to guard nests on several occasions (Agha et al. 2013), and the hatching success of eggs in both first and second clutches was over 65 including those lost to predators, and over 75 when excluding eggs lost to predators (Ennen et al. 2012a).;Fires started by turbine malfunctions and other anthropogenic sources have burned large areas of tortoise habitat at Mesa, substantially altering plant composition and abundance (Figure 6.3). Several tortoises carry the scars of past exposure (Lovich et al. 2011c) and one adult female was killed at her shallow burrow next to a row of turbines in 1995. The 1995 fire, unrelated to wind energy operations, provided an opportunity to examine tortoise activity areas, reproductive output and body condition (Lovich et al. 2011c) in the short (19972000) and longer term (20092011) postfire. Activity areas of tortoises remained in their same general locations between intervals and some tortoises shifted their activity area centroids into burned areas from unburned areas. In addition, annual reproductive output and body conditions did not differ significantly between monitoring periods.;Figure 6.3 A turbineinduced fire landscape in the Mesa wind farm near Palm Springs, California, USA, burned the Agassizs Desert Tortoise habitat shown in the photograph. Note the burned Creosote Bush Larrea tridentata in the foreground. This plant is a common associate of Desert Tortoise habitat and is poorly adapted to fire, rarely regenerating following a severe burn. (Joshua Ennen)
