Figure 8.7 Whitetailed Eagles interacting within the Smla Wind Farm. (Espen Lie Dahl);The impact from mortality has a wider spatial component than the impact from disturbance as the impact from reduced survival rate among adult eagles can be traced in territories out to 5 km from the wind farm, with reproductive success reduced in territories out to 1 km. For species such as the WTE, such effects have demographic consequences, making their population growth rate particularly vulnerable to changes in adult survival rates. It is therefore essential to take both disturbance and mortality into consideration when planning future wind farms.;For nonraptors, Everaert (2014) suggested a significant impact at a regionalnational level in the breeding colony of terns as a result of the increase in additional mortality (1.42.0) through collision at Zeebrugge wind farms. Using the population simulation model VORTEX on eight bird species (passerines, raptors and waders) and employing data from the literature, Htker et al. (2006) detected a high variation in the impact on population development of additional mortality due to wind farms. However, even with relatively small increases in mortality, decreasing trends were clearly recognisable for all species. A collision of an individual of a longlived species resulted in a larger increase in the overall
