Figure 3.3 Example of an inconspicuous plant species, Vernica (Veronica micrantha). (Bio3);This chapter summarises the negative effects of wind farm construction and operation on flora and vegetation, including both the obvious direct effects of removal during construction and the more subtle effects during operation. As far as the authors were aware, an exhaustive compilation of all the effects and actions responsible for them does not yet exist. Although a full treatment was beyond the scope of this chapter, the objective was to review and document what are thought to be the more important effects and impacts. It was hoped that this process would illuminate gaps in knowledge or data and identify major problems with impact assessment. For example, most EIAs present only a brief analysis of potential effects, frequently with just a superficial analysis of flora and vegetation, which limits researchers ability to quantify any impacts.;To achieve these goals, the authors consulted 36 EIA studies conducted in 14 different countries from all around the world, but mainly in Europe and the Americas, that were available online (Table 3.2). Studies were conducted in the official web pages of companies (consultants), promoters (developers) and governments. The results, presented in Table 3.3, show that the most referenced effect was the direct destruction of vegetation andor important
