ROBERT M.R. BARCLAY, ERIN F. BAERWALD and JENS RYDELL;Using data from published studies and unpublished reports, this chapter summarises what is known regarding the effects of wind turbines on bats, assesses hypotheses as to why bats are killed, and suggests where critical gaps in our understanding exist. Although there may be nonlethal effects of wind turbines on bats, such as loss of roosting or foraging habitat, there are few data regarding these potential impacts. On the other hand, based on numerous studies at individual wind farms and the current total global wind energy production, it is estimated that millions of bats are killed at wind turbines globally each year. Although data are almost exclusively from North America and Europe, rather than where bat diversity is its highest andor wind energy is most prevalent, more recent research has helped to elucidate the causes of bat fatalities. Fatalities occur because of direct impact by moving turbine blades, and from internal injuries caused when bats fly through zones of low air pressure along turbine blades. Although there is considerable variation in the species composition of fatalities across wind farms, the majority of bats killed belongs to species that fly high in open spaces, including migratory and nonmigratory species. Fatalities peak in late summer or autumn and in conditions of low wind and warm temperatures. These patterns may be driven by changes in the abundance of bats flying in the zone of risk (the bladeswept area) because of changes in behaviour such as during autumn migration and changes in feeding areas, but also by attraction of bats to wind farms or turbines as the bats search for resources including roosts, mates and prey. Future research must assess the populationlevel consequences of bat fatalities and consider cumulative effects of wind farms on both local and migrant
