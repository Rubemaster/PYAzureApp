Terrestrial invertebrates are often the dominant consumers and pollinators of plants, are a major food resource for birds, bats, mammals, reptiles and other invertebrates, and are critical soil engineers and detritivores. Although invertebrates are vital to ecosystems, exceptionally few published studies have investigated the potential effects of wind farms on terrestrial invertebrates. Many insects are likely to be killed by colliding with turbine blades and vehicles on wind farm access roads, but the magnitudes of these losses and their impacts on local communities have not been measured. Although these collisions may be more apparent, other aspects of wind farm development may have more pronounced effects on invertebrate communities. Constructing and operating wind farms may lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, chemical pollution and dust, noise pollution, the introduction of invasive species along access roads and changes in environmental factors. Changes in the bat and bird communities may alter the numbers and species of invertebrates at wind farms, which may cascade to lower trophic levels. Data are largely lacking on how wind farms may affect terrestrial invertebrates however, the literature suggests that the byproducts of wind farm development may, individually and in concert, have strong impacts on terrestrial invertebrates. Future research should address the degree to which wind farm developments affect terrestrial invertebrates, and possible research directions are suggested based on a literature review. Overall, despite the rapid development of wind farms, little is known about their interactions with invertebrates. Wind farms could be better sited and managed through informative studies addressing the points suggested in this chapter.
