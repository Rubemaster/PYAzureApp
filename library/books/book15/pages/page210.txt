Barrier effects have been reported for many species (Htker 2008) and the phenomenon seems to be very widespread. There are many casual observations of flocks of migrating birds becoming disorganised when approaching a wind farm (Koop 1999 Isselbcher  Isselbcher 2001). In only very few cases, however, have barrier effects been systematically studied (de Lucas et al. 2004 BioConsult SH  ARSU 2010), and there are also many examples of birds overflying wind farms without any sign ofdisturbance (Handke et al. 1999 Still et al. 1996 van den Bergh et al. 2002 Steinborn  Reichenbach 2011). Different bird species react to wind farms to different extents (Winkelman 1992 Albouy et al. 2001 Reichenbach 2003 BioConsult SH  ARSU 2010). In particular circumstances at particular locations, large numbers of travelling birds may be affected (Albouy et al. 2001 Bergen 2001b). For Pinkfooted Geese migrating over the sea along the east coast of the UK, Plonczkier and Simms (2012) showed that 94 of the original 292 flocks on course to enter two small offshore wind farms actively avoided them. Moreover, ducks at Lake Ijsselmeer in the Netherlands avoided flying through wind farms at night (Dirksen et al. 2000) and over 70 of soaring birds changed flight altitude or flight direction when approaching wind farms in southern Spain (de Lucas et al. 2004). Avoidance does not, however, automatically mean an enormous loss of time and energy. Masden et al. (2009) showed that the additional flight distance of 500 m incurred by Common Eiders when avoiding a single offshore wind farm in Denmark carried negligible energetic consequences.;Habituation may be defined as a form of learning in which an organism decreases its response or ceases to respond to a stimulus after repeated exposure (Hinde 1970). In the context of birds and wind farms, the term habituation is used to describe a reduction of avoidance of wind farms by birds over time. In the biological sense, habituation refers to individuals, whereas in bird and wind farm studies it is how the effect upon individuals is manifested at a population scale that is important. But, unless marked individuals are studied, it cannot be clear whether a population of birds is truly demonstrating habituation. Even in bird species experiencing high survival rates, many, if not most, of the individuals will have been replaced over a study period of several years. In this chapter, habituation will be used as the context of an apparent response through a change in distribution or abundance consistent with habituation, and not in the strict biological sense.;In fact, few studies of avoidance have lasted long enough to be able to detect any influence of habituation. Madsen and Boertmann (2008) showed that springstaging Pinkfooted Geese reduced avoidance distances from approximately 200 m to 100 m, from more than 100 m to 40 m and from 125 m to 50 m in three wind farms in Denmark over periods of 810 years. A compilation of earlier studies, lasting for at least two years, provided little evidence for habituation. Birds did not show a general tendency to reduce
