Figure 2.4 Measurements of the differences (downwind minus upwind) in sensible heat flux for the overnight period of 2728 August 2010 in a large wind farm. Measurements were taken at 4.5 m above the surface in a Maize field (height 1.8 m). Station 1 was upwind of a line of turbines, and Stations 2, 3 and 4 were successively farther downwind. Station 4 reported the largest difference from Station 1. The differences all are negative, indicating that the upwind flux was larger (in this case less negative) than the downwind flux.;Wind tunnel studies have a long history of providing new insight into aerodynamic flow mechanisms that are difficult or expensive to explore in the free atmospheric boundary layer (Vermeer et al. 2003 Chamorro  PortAgel 2009). Wind tunnel models represent smallscale physical replicas of actual wind farm layouts that are very useful for developing an understanding of the aerodynamics of wind farms. However, until recently, wind tunnel studies of wind farms have been limited to conditions of neutral thermal stratification and therefore have not contributed to the understanding of changes in wind farm microclimates. Reports by Chamorro and PortAgel (2010), Markfort et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2013a 2013b) extended previous thermally neutral flow simulations to include the effects of thermal stratification, including both stably stratified (by use of a cooled floor) and thermally convective (heated floor) boundary layers. These reports generally agree that the overall change in surface heat flux induced by wind farms is small. However, the rotation of the blades creates a highly asymmetric wake influence on surface heat flux, with the downwardmoving half of the wake having an opposite effect from
