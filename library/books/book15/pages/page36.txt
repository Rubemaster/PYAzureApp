However, screening is still advised as it can offer early opportunities for consultation on the suitability of a proposed site. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) advocates this approach in its guidance for landbased wind energy projects (USFWS 2012), and the EIA Directive in Europe (Box 1.2) also advises a staged approach that includes the screening of potential wind farm projects to determine highlevel issues and the need for EIA.;Additional information such as proposed survey and impact assessment methodologies add value to the scoping process by reducing the potential for challenges to the survey and assessment approach at the decision stage. This is particularly important for receptors that lack a single standard survey approach, such as birds, where there are a number of potential survey methodologies depending on the species that may be present, or for which project receptor specific assessment criteria may need to be agreed.;Scoping documents are often made available for public consultation, particularly to the local community and stakeholders that may be directly affected by the proposal. Such exercises can provide a very effective means of capturing local knowledge of the environment in and around a proposed project, while also providing an opportunity for the public to feed into the project design process. It also allows developers an early opportunity to mitigate any concerns raised. For this reason, public consultation generally continues throughout the preapplication stage. Scoping documents usually contain the following information
