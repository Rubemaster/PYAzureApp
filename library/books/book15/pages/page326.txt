This stresses the importance of considerate siting of new wind farms by taking into account the potential impact on terrestrial mammals.;Also, habitat conversion need not result in reduced habitat quality for all species (Lovich  Ennen 2013). In the Altamont Pass in California, grounddwelling mammals such as Desert Cottontail Sylvilagus audubonii, Pocket Gopher Thomomys bottae and to some degree California Ground Squirrel Spermophilus beecheyi are attracted to new ground structures associated with wind farm construction, such as concrete turbine pads, rock piles and hillside cuts for access roads (Smallwood  Thelander 2004). In forested areas, wind power development will create permanent forest edges to roads, power lines and turbine pads. Here, the amount of forage in the field and shrub layer may increase in comparison to a forest with a closed canopy. In agricultural areas, strips of permanent grassland often skirt access roads and turbine pads. The new ecotones may attract seed eating, grazing and browsing animals (e.g. Ecke et al. 2002 Kuijper et al. 2009) and, in turn, predators (e.g. Brandt  Lambin 2007 Sidorovich et al. 2010 Latham et al. 2011). Thus, the habitat change may have positive or at least complex effects for many species.;Kaitlyn L. Taylor, Jeffrey L. Beck, Snehalata V. Huzurbazar and Shannon E. Albeke;In temperate North America, some landscapes with high potential for wind energy development support valuable wintering habitat for ungulates. This has become a critical issue for future development of wind farms on the Wyoming landscape because Wyoming is home to approximately half of the North American population of Pronghorn Antilocapra americana. Several ungulate species exposed to oil and gas development have shown avoidance behaviour (Cameron et al. 2005 Sawyer et al. 2009 Beckman et al. 2012 Buchanan et al. 2014), but the response of these same species to wind farms has not been thoroughly evaluated. The Dunlap Ranch wind farm, located in Carbon County in southcentral Wyoming approximately 11.8 km north of Medicine Bow, was
