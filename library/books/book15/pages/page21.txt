The first theme will review the technology the types of wind turbines in use and how they work. The theme focuses on three bladed wind turbines, which are most commonly deployed in wind farms, but also considers small to mediumsized wind turbines and verticalaxis wind turbines. The second theme will consider the planning and statutory permitting requirements, focusing on those relative to considering wildlife and the environment, using the UK as a specific example. The third theme will describe the development process that wind farm companies typically undertake in identifying wind farm sites, from initial site selection through to mitigation and monitoring.;Wind turbines use the kinetic energy of the wind to generate electrical energy. Traditional turbines consist of three main elements the tower, the nacelle and, most commonly, three rotor blades. The steel tower is fixed to the ground by a concrete foundation. The nacelle, composed of glassfibre reinforced plastic, sits at the top of the tower and is connected to the blades via the rotor hub. Both hub and blades are also typically composed of glass fibre reinforced plastic. A rotor shaft inside the nacelle connects the hub to the generator, usually via a gearbox.;The wind blows on the angled blades of the rotor, causing the rotor shaft to rotate and convert some of the winds kinetic energy into mechanical energy. The generator converts this mechanical energy into electrical energy. Traditional wind turbines employ a gearbox to increase the rotational speed of the rotor shaft and, therefore, the efficiency of the generator (Figure 1.2). An anemometer on top of the nacelle monitors wind speed and direction, starting the turbine when wind speeds are sufficient, the cutin speed, and shutting it down when wind speeds exceed its maximum operating speed. In general, turbines cut in at around 4 or 5 metres per second (ms) and shut down at speeds exceeding 30
