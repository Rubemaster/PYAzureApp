There is increasing awareness that wind farms have the potential to impact on wildlife. Freshwater ecosystems can also be affected and the aim of this chapter was to draw together the current state of understanding on the effects of onshore wind farms on aquatic organisms. This study is based on a literature review and a number of themes are discussed, including water quality, hydrology and habitat fragmentation. A case study of potential effects upon a highly sensitive protected species, the Freshwater Pearl Mussel Margaritifera margaritifera, is included. Although the types of potential impacts on aquatic areas are broadly understood, there is a general absence of scientific studies on actual observed effects. However, it is clear that the problems will be similar to those that occur as a result of other types of development and activity, such as road building and forestry operations. A deterioration in water quality is the most easily identifiable potential impact. Wind farms also usually require access roads, and watercourse crossings bring the potential for habitat fragmentation. There have been a number of cases of wind farm developments causing major landslides, which have resulted in serious impacts on river catchments. Impacts on aquatic areas generally occur only during the construction phase, and ongoing operation of wind farms is usually unlikely to result in significant effects. Impacts can again potentially occur when a wind farm is being decommissioned. Most of the potential issues arising between wind farms and the aquatic environment can be avoided or mitigated through careful project design and management. On sites that already have erosion issues, the development of a wind farm, instigating suitable water quality mitigation, could potentially bring longterm benefits to the receiving aquatic environment. However, more research is needed as there is a general absence of preand
