Invertebrates dominate the animal component of the terrestrial biosphere in terms of abundance, biomass and species diversity (Gaston 1991). They play critical roles as herbivores, predators, detritivores and pollinators, profoundly affecting local communities, biomass turnover and ecosystem function (Collins  Thomas 1991). Terrestrial invertebrates, primarily insects, also form a critical and often dominant food resource for birds, bats, reptiles and small mammals, as well as other invertebrates (Pianka  Parker 1975 Drut et al. 1994 Valdez  Cryan 2013). Any effects of wind farm development on terrestrial invertebrates could therefore have impacts that reverberate throughout the broader community (Pace et al. 1999).;Figure 4.1 A number of wind farms in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have included monitoring for protected butterflies such as this Marsh Fritillary Euphydryas aurinia, even leading to habitat plans to benefit particular species (e.g. RES UK  Ireland Ltd 2014). However, to date, such information has not been published in the peerreviewed literature. (Martin R. Perrow);Wind farms are rapidly developing in many areas of the world, and are generally located in windy areas (with wind speeds 20 kmh) (Pimentel et al. 2002) with available land, access roads, connection to a transmission line and acceptable environmental conditions (Serrano Gonzlez et al. 2014). Turbines are rapidly being installed in North America, Europe, China and Brazil to help meet rising energy demands. Most wind farms are sited in cultivated fields or in natural areas with short vegetation, such as prairie. An exception to this is the wind farms being built in Swedish boreal forests. Hilltops and mountains can be popular places for wind farms (Clarke 1989 Karydis 2013), in part because winds are often
