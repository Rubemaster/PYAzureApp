Finally, the importance of good site selection is identified as a key process in mitigating potential impacts on wildlife and the permitting process in general. It is recommended that local and national regulators support this process by preparing strategic locational guidance to assist wind farm developers in selecting appropriate areas where the inclusion of a wind farm may betolerable.;Sincere thanks to Renewable Energy Systems Limited (RES) and Nick Bristow for kindly providing photographic material.
