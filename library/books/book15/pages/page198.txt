James PearceHiggins and coworkers (PearceHiggins et al. 2009 2012) studied the extent to which wind farm developments affected densities of a range of representative Scottish upland bird species. They investigated whether local densities of birds changed from the preconstruction period through the construction period and into the postconstruction (operational) period. They also examined whether there was reduced occurrence of breeding birds in close proximity to wind farms within one season.;In their first study, PearceHiggins et al. (2009) examined bird survey data (breeding bird surveys, counts of individuals, numbers of raptors flying) from areas extending up to 1 km from the turbines and from reference areas. Bird occurrence was modelled as a function of habitat before examining the additional effects of wind farm proximity. After accounting for habitat variation, 7 out of the 12 species studied were found to occur at significantly lower frequencies close to the turbines. No species were more likely to occur close to turbines, and no significant effects were found for Common Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus, Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis or Eurasian Stonechat Saxicola rubicola. Levels of turbine avoidance suggest that breeding bird densities may be reduced within a 500 m buffer of the turbines by 1553 (Table 7.3). In some species reductions covered an even wider buffer.;Table 7.3 Predicted reductions in breeding densities, or raptor flight activity, within 500 m of the turbine array in upland habitats according to PearceHiggins et al. (2009).
