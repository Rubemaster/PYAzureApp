Since 2002, the State Bird Observatory of the Brandenburg Environmental Agency has collected data on collisions of birdsand bats with wind turbines all over Germany (Drr 2004). The goal of the register has been to assimilate information scattered in various places in order to provide information on species potentially affected by existing and future wind farms. The data collated have been mostly collected and reported at random. However, the proportion of systematically collected data has been increasing, and thereby improving the quality of the register. The geographic coverage is incomplete, and both the search effort and the chances of reporting are largely unknown. Hence, the numbers reported to the register are far from being complete, making the total number of collision victims in Germany likely to be far higher than officially listed. The lack of systematic data collection and the presumably highly variable reporting rate between species both complicate statistical analyses and prevent the calculation of meaningful mortality rates due to collisions with wind turbines. Still, the data provide an overview of which groups of species may be most affected.;Figure 8.1 Numbers of recorded collision victims per bird species in the German wind turbine collision register as of 11 December 2014. Species are sorted in systematic order following Bauer et al. (2005) 1 Cygnus atratus 333 Emberiza schoeniclus. The small letters are species codes, which are deciphered in Table 8.2.
