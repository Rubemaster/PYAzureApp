Figure 1.3 Electricity generation and distribution.;There are two main classes of wind turbine those whose rotors spin about a horizontal axis, termed horizontalaxis wind turbines (HAWTs), and verticalaxis wind turbines (VAWTs), whose rotors spin about a vertical axis (Figure 1.4). HAWTs typically have either two or three blades. Threebladed HAWTs are operated upwind, with the blades facing into the wind. Sensors mounted above the turbine nacelle orientate the rotor with respect to the wind. The rotor speed as well as the power output can be controlled by pitching the rotor blades along their longitudinal axis. This blade pitching allows the aerodynamically engineered blades to control lift and thus power generation from the wind, but also acts as a form of protection against extreme wind conditions and overspeed through pitching to reduce lift.;Most early HAWT designs operated at fixed speeds and utilised brakes to hold the blades until a sufficient wind speed was detected. Modern HAWTs (Figure 1.5) operate at variable speeds with sensors allowing the rotor blades to match the wind speed until peak or rated speeds are attained. This allows costeffective energy generation at low speeds in light winds.
