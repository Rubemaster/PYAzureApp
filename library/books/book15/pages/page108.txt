Figure 4.2 Schematic showing potential impacts of wind farm development on terrestrial invertebrates. Solid and dashed lines indicate direct and indirect impacts, respectively. (Creative Commons Share Alike, Blue73);To organise the discussion, this chapter examines where wind farms are typically located and how invertebrates may overlap with these areas. The remainder of the chapter addresses wind farm impacts arising from two main sources the turbines themselves with their spinning blades and associated environmental effects and the associated effects from construction and use of roads, such as collisions and dust (Figure 4.2). These sources may affect invertebrates directly (e.g. from collisions with turbines or vehicles) or indirectly via habitat fragmentation and loss, chemical and noise pollution and dust, facilitation of the spread of invasive species and changes in local climate. Wind farms may also have neutral, positive or negative effects on invertebrate populations by altering higher trophic levels (e.g. Romero  Koricheva 2011). Potential impacts are summarised within this framework in the next section.;Turbines have generally been placed in rows facing the prevailing wind direction, with neighbouring turbines separated by an appropriate minimum distance (Serrano Gonzlez et al. 2014) (Figure 4.3A). Increasingly complex models are being used to micro site turbines in patterns that generate more power and higher profits (Serrano Gonzlez et al. 2014) (Figure 4.3B). These micro siting decisions may strongly alter the impacts of wind farm developments on terrestrial invertebrates for a number of reasons. Because invertebrates are unlikely to be uniformly distributed
