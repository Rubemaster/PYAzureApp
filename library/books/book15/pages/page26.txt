Table 1.1 Definitions of micro, small and mediumsized wind turbines according to RenewableUK (2010).;In parallel with the trend of increasing rotor blade length and the size of turbines, there has also been significant increase in the development and deployment of small and mediumsized wind turbines. These classes of turbine range in size from microturbines less than 20 m in height to mediumsized wind turbines of up to 55 m (Table 1.1). RenewableUK (2014a) commonly categorises small wind turbines as singleturbine installations, usually owned by individual homeowners or farmers for onsite electricity consumption, such as the example shown in Figure 1.7. In comparison, mediumsized wind projects are larger developments that may also supply electricity to the grid, and are often investor financed. Importantly, RenewableUK notes that despite the size differences, small and mediumsized projects are typically installed to provide onsite electricity to homes, farms and small communities. They only use the electricity grid to sell back any excess generation above their immediate energy needs. This is in contrast to largescale wind farms that feed all their generated electricity direct to national electricity grids.
