Figure 9.5 Corrected bat fatality rates at eight wind farms in southwest Alberta, Canada, illustrating the decline of fatalities over time. Each symbol represents a different site.;If populations of bats have been negatively affected by fatalities at turbines, then it may be predicted that fatality rates would decline over time, reflecting the declining population at risk. In support of this prediction, fatality rates at several wind farms in southwestern Alberta declined significantly over a relatively short timeframe (Figure 9.5). The mean fatality rate declined by 74 between the first 3 years and the last 4 years (t5.44, P0.001).;Aside from declining population sizes, another potential explanation for the decline in fatality rates is that bats learn to avoid turbines. This would require some negative, but nonlethal, experience such as a close encounter with moving turbine blades. While it is unlikely that such encounters occur frequently enough to cause the steep declines observed at the Alberta sites, several studies using thermal imaging to observe the behaviour of bats around turbines have reported close approaches to turbine blades, especially slowmoving blades (Horn et al. 2008 Cryan et al. 2014), although these are relatively rare. Learning could perhaps also involve bats being attracted to turbines looking for resources (mates, roosts, insects), finding none and thus being less attracted in the future. If learning is responsible for at least some of the decline in fatalities, then it may be predicted that subadults (young of the year) would become a greater proportion of fatalities over time as they have not had a chance to learn about turbines. At one site in Alberta, the proportion of subadults among fatalities did indeed increase from one year to the next for both Hoary Bats (31.7 to 52.1 212.5, P0.001) and Silverhaired Bats (36.0 to 57.5 27.9, P0.005) (Baerwald  Barclay 2011).
