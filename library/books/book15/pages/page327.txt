In temperate North America, some landscapes with high potential for wind energy development support valuable wintering habitat for ungulates. This has become a critical issue for future development of wind farms on the Wyoming landscape because Wyoming is home to approximately half of the North American population of Pronghorn Antilocapra americana. Several ungulate species exposed to oil and gas development have shown avoidance behaviour (Cameron et al. 2005 Sawyer et al. 2009 Beckman et al. 2012 Buchanan et al. 2014), but the response of these same species to wind farms has not been thoroughly evaluated. The Dunlap Ranch wind farm, located in Carbon County in southcentral Wyoming approximately 11.8 km north of Medicine Bow, wasconstructed from September 2009 to September 2010 by Pacifi Corp on crucial winter range for Pronghorn as identified by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (Figure 10.6). The wind farm consists of 74 General Electric Company 1.5 MW wind turbines (119 m tall), 28.3 km of access roads, 3 meteorological towers (80 m tall), an onsite 34.5230 kV substation and on site maintenance buildings.;To gain insight into the potential impact of the site, 47 adult female Pronghorn at the Dunlap Ranch were monitored using storeonboard GPS collars over three winters 2010 (January April), 20102011 and 20112012 (both NovemberApril), covering late construction and early operation phases of the wind farm (Figure 10.6). Females are generally thought to represent the local population better than males, as they are less likely to disperse and will contribute to the local population directly through reproduction. The objectives of the study were to evaluate (1) movement rate in relation to distance to wind farm infrastructure (2) habitat selection at the population and individual levels and (3) mortality risk of exposure to the wind farm.;Figure 10.6 Winter at the Dunlap Ranch wind farm in Wyoming, USA. A total of 47 female Pronghorn were fitted with GPS collars (inset photograph) over three winters during and following construction of the site to evaluate the response of the local Pronghorn population to wind energy development.
