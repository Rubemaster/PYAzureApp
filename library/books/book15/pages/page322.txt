In Portugal since the mid2000s, the development of wind farms has overlapped with the known range of Iberian Wolf Canis lupus signatus, and now covers almost half of all known packs territories. Wind farms are mostly constructed in mountain ridges used by packs as core areas, creating a potential source of disturbance for wolves. To test this assumption, a longterm monitoring programme was conducted in two wind farms built within core areas of wolf pack territories to evaluate the effects on breeding occurrence and breeding site selection. The two wind farms were Serra da Nave wind farm (Moimenta da Beira, central Portugal), comprising 19 turbines within the territory of pack A, and Alto Minho wind farm Melgao, northwest Portugal), comprising 49 turbines within the territory of pack B (Figure 10.2).;Figure 10.2 The construction phase of Alto Minho wind farm showing the extent of the access road, habitat modification and the level of machinery and human presence. (Helena RioMaior);Wolf breeding parameters were evaluated over a 15year period from 2000 to 2014, throughout preconstruction, construction and operation phases of both wind farms. The parameters were occurrence of breeding, cumulative number of breeding sites used and distance of breeding sites to the nearest wind turbine. Breeding occurrence and location for each pack in each year were assessed by visual and acoustic detection of pups during the puprearing period (July to September). For Alto Minho wind farm, the home ranges of two wolves from pack B were obtained by GPS telemetry during construction and the first 2 years of operation (Figure 10.3).
