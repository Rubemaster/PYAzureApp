Figure 11.10 Wind farms occur in a wide variety of locations, such as here in the car park of a zoological park in Suffolk, England utilised in the study of avoidance rates by Cook et al. (2014). The site attracts large numbers of a variety of gull species feeding on foodstuffs intended for the animals, and on human leftovers. A study of avoidance behaviour and collision risk here is likely to deliver very different results from another site in different circumstances, but on the same species. (Martin R. Perrow);This emphasises that the use of CRM as a tool to help predict the level of mortality that might be expected at a site still relies on rigorous empirical studies of a range of species in different circumstances of which there are still relatively few. In other words, much remains to be learned about the nature of bird collision with turbines. For bats, even more needs to be understood.;A number of other effects of turbines and related infrastructure have been documented. Bats are known to be attracted to turbines, with one theory suggesting they are attempting to access roost sites in and around the nacelle and other structures (Barclay et al., Chapter 9). Oldergeneration turbines, especially those with lattice structures, offer a range of nooks and crannies. In the APWRA, hole nesting species such as American Kestrel Falco sparverius and several owl species have often been recovered from turbines. Indeed, entrapment accounts for 0.31.5 of fatalities in different studies in this area, with oiling also commonly recorded, indicating that birds
