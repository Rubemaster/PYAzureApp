Available measurements of microclimates in wind farms are verylimited. More studies are needed in a wider variety of wind farm locations. Furthermore, the range of microclimate changes caused by wind farms may be of more significance to some ecosystems than others. The limited measurements taken over monoculture agricultural crops in the Midwest region of the USA are unlikely to capture the impacts that may exist within a rich and heterogeneous natural ecosystem, particularly in regions that are climatically different. For instance, climates that are very dry and windy (good locations for wind farms) are prone to soil erosion and loss of vegetation, such as occurred over a wide region of the Great Plains of the USA in the 1930s. The response of landowners after that event was to plant agricultural shelterbelts  long lines of trees  to slow the wind and reduce soil loss. Ecosystems in such extreme climates would be likely to experience a highly positive effect of reduced surface wind speeds as would be expected from wind farms, according to the conceptual model.;Armstrong, A., Waldron, S., Whitaker, J.
