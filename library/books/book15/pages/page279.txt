Secondly, fatalities of bats are concentrated on relatively few species, thus potentially having significant impacts on their populations. For example, three species make up almost 80 of fatalities in North America, including Hoary Bat Lasiurus cinereus (Figure 9.1), and four species make up over 60 of fatalities in Europe (Table 9.1). In addition, migratory bats make up a large proportion of fatalities (Table 9.1), and bats killed at individualwind farms are drawn from large areas (Voigt et al. 2012 Baerwald et al. 2014). Thus, there is the potential to have much farther reaching effects than simply on local populations.;Figure 9.1 A dead Hoary Bat Lasiurus cinereus found during carcass searches at a wind farm in West Virginia, USA. (Cris D. Hein, Bat Conservation International);Thirdly, the life history traits of bats enhance the potential for significant populationlevel effects caused by fatalities at turbines. Bats have slow life histories, involving long lives and thus relatively low natural mortality rates (Racey  Entwistle 2000 Barclay  Harder 2003). They also reproduce slowly, with females of almost all species producing only one or two offspring per year. The limited reproductive capacity and low natural mortality rate suggest that bats have restricted ability to respond to increased mortality rates, and therefore increased mortality due to wind turbines is likely to have a negative effect on population stability.;Fourthly, bats play significant and varied ecological roles in ecosystems, and provide essential ecological services (Kunz et al. 2011). Virtually all of the bat species killed by wind turbines to date are insectivorous (Table 9.1), and bats are the major consumers of nightflying insects. Bats reduce insect populations and herbivory (Kalka et al. 2008 Morrison  Lindell 2012), including in agricultural and forestry systems (Federico et al. 2008 Williams
