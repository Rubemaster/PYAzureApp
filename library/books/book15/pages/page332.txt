Gulo gulo (May et al. 2006).;Figure 10.7 Access roads to wind farms are often relatively wide and may involve clearance of fringing vegetation, especially trees, creating new habitat for some mammals and barriers to movement for others. (Anna Skarin);It should be noted that avoidance may not be consistent, however, but differs between species and seasons (Johnson et al. 2005), and depends inter alia on individual condition and reproductive status, and on the presence of alternative sites (Stankowich 2008). In addition, animals may habituate to disturbance (Reimers  Colman 2006 Stankowich 2008 Reimers et al. 2010). Accordingly, several studies have been unable to document negative impacts from disturbance on large mammals (e.g. McLellan  Shackleton 1989). In addition, disturbance of large carnivores may create predationfree refugia for ungulates, resulting in higher ungulate abundance in disturbed areas (Rogala et al. 2011). Hence, the ultimate effects from human disturbance on the behaviour, distribution or fitness of terrestrial mammals may be complex and difficult to forecast.
