The construction of wind farms potentially threatens important natural assests, such as rare habitats and plant species. Unfortunately, there are very few specific studies on the impacts of wind farms on vegetation compared to fauna such as birds and bats, to assess the scale of the issue. As a result, the authors consulted several Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies available online conducted in different countries around the world, and made a brief analysis of the negative effects on vegetation evaluated, although these were rarely the focus of the EIA. The consensus was that direct effects related to the removal of vegetation and destruction of protected plant species and indirect effects of disturbance may obviously operate during construction, but in operation, impacts may also originate from more subtle effects like the deposition of dust on vegetation and genetic pollution. The most commonly cited and potentially significant effects were then discussed in more detail using related information in the literature. It was concluded that it is not unlikely that impacts could lead to loss of biodiversity at a regional scale, particularly taking into account the effects that invasive flora can have upon native vegetation, and consequently this should not be considered as a minor detail in impact assessment. The general lack of basic information about natural features present in potential wind farm sites appears to be partly responsible for a more rigorous evaluation of effects. Owing to the uniqueness of some habitats and species and the danger that alien species pose to biodiversity, appropriate methods to minimise possible impacts must be defined and action taken with the support of appropriate monitoring. The end of construction does not necessarily mean that vegetation can readily return to its original state, and landscape restoration is often
