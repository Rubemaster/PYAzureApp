Figure 10.7), only the preliminary studies of Tanis and Finck (2012) suggested avoidance of roads by Coyote, whereas Pronghorn showed no obvious effect (Box 10.2). In contrast, the more extensive studies in gas fields in North America, where access roads are built between well pads, often in previously relatively undisturbed areas, showed avoidance of the roads as well as the well pads by Mule Deer Odocoileus hemionus (Sawyer et al. 2006 2009), Wapiti (Harju et al. 2011 Buchanan et al. 2014), Caribou (Dyer et al. 2001 Polfus et al. 2011) and Pronghorn (Beckmann et al. 2012). The avoidance increased with traffic frequency, but even roads with fewer than ten vehicles per day were avoided to some extent (Sawyer et al. 2009).;It is important to realise that building access roads into a previously unexploited area also increases the access for the public. While maintenance crews are unlikely to move outside roads and pads, this is not the case for hikers, hunters, berrypickers, wildlife watchers and dogwalkers (depending on the country concerned) that may make use of the increased accessibility. Even if roads are gated, bicycles and offroad vehicles may be difficult to keep out. Thus, the public may be more likely to create disturbance to wildlife than the maintenance crews. Clearly, the effects of increased public accessibility must be factored in when discussing the potential effects of wind power development.;For ungulates, there are studies showing displacement from human disturbance in Moose Alces alces (Neumann et al. 2011), Wapiti (Harju et al. 2011), Mule Deer (Sawyer et al. 2009) and CaribouReindeer (Nellemann  Cameron 1998 Vistnes  Nellemann 2008 Nellemann et al. 2010). Ungulates are known to be particularly vulnerable to disturbance during the calving period (Nellemann  Cameron 1998 Phillips  Alldredge 2000 Nellemann et al. 2010) and in winter (Dyer et al. 2001 Webb et al. 2013), when frequent human disturbance may lead to reduced reproductive success or reduced winter survival.;Larger carnivores may show a clear preference for undisturbed, rugged terrain (May et al. 2006 Elfstrm et al. 2008) and generally be very sensitive to human disturbance, although they may sometimes visit populated areas. A tendency to concentrate home ranges and select denning sites away from areas regularly frequented by people and traffic has been observed for Grey Wolf (Theuerkauf et al. 2003 Jedrzejewski et al. 2004 Karlsson et al. 2007 Houle et al. 2010), Bobcat Lynx rufus (George  Crooks 2006), GrizzlyBrown Bear Ursus arctos (Mace et al. 1996 Gibeau et al. 2002 Nellemann et al. 2007 Martin et al. 2010) and Wolverine
