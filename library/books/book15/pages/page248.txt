Figure 8.5 Griffon Vulture found dead under a wind turbine in Tarifa, Spain. This species suffers one of the highest collision rates recorded in wind farm studies. (Manuela de LucasCSIC);A final key point in relation to collision rates is that the collision rates of small rselected species such as passerines, accepting that these may be underestimated (see above), may be matched by long lived, slowturnover kselected species. For example, although the mortality of Griffon Vulture at a number of sites in Spain varies between sites and turbines, the highest rate at 8.17 birds per turbine per year is above the mean collision rate recorded (4.35 birds per turbine per year see above) and among the highest rates recorded by any study (Table 8.1 and Figure 8.5). This illustrates the potential for population effects on such species (see Populationscale effects, below), particularly those of conservation concern.;In the case of power lines, Janss (2000) classified species on the basis of their morphological characteristics as being more or less susceptible to collision or electrocution. A high wing loading is associated with low manoeuvrability in flight, and a low capacity for powered flight is typical of some soaring birds, such as Griffon Vultures (Rayner 1988) (Figure 8.6). Such species are susceptible to electrocution and collision in power lines (Bevanger 1998), and resulting collision with wind turbines (Barrios  Rodrguez 2004 de Lucas et al. 2008) (Figure 8.5). However, using a extensive database of bird fatalities in wind farms, HerreraAlsina et al. (2013) revealed that birds of small size and with longer wings and low wind loading were likely to collide because they spend a lot of their foraging time close to the turbines, thereby increasing their probability of collision.
