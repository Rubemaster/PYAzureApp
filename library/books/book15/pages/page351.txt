Themes would most usefully explore the nature of any effects, including whether they were realised or only offered potential from a consideration of ecological principles. Whilst I have faithfully tried to represent the findings of the respective authors, my interpretation of the information they provide may differ, and any reader is encouraged to refer to the original work. The information tabulated (Table 11.1) demonstrated that even where a topic had been subject to considerable amount of study, such as the collision of birds, it was often difficult to generalise over effects and subsequent impacts, primarily as a result of site and species specificity and even the interaction between the two. There was considerable uncertainty over the potential for populationscale impacts especially from cumulative effects.;Table 11.1 Summary information of how flora and the different faunal groups have been treated and studied in relation to wind farms, and the main effects and impacts, including at a populationscale, that have been revealed.
