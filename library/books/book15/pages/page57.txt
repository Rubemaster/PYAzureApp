Although the research literature includes numerous studies of the aerodynamic effects of wind turbines on wind speed and turbulence, studies on the influences of wind turbines or wind farms on microclimate effects in wind farms are very limited. Indeed, the only studies that report the influence of wind farms on temperature from in situ measurements are the studies of Baidya Roy and Traiteur (2010), Smith et al. (2013) and Rajewski et al. (2013 2014). However, the latter are the only reports up to now of microclimate concurrent in situ conditions inside as well as outside wind farms during known operational periods (see Measured effects of turbines on microclimate processes, below). The first two studies provide measurements only at points upwind and downwind of the wind farm and cite no observations inside the wind farms. For example, Baidya Roy and Traiteur (2010) provide data from a meteorological field campaign that consisted of nearsurfacetemperature measurements taken upwind and downwind of a wind farm in California for 53 days during the summer of 1989. The results show significantly lower temperature at 5 m height at the downwind location from about 1300 to 2100 local standard time (LST) and slightly warmer temperatures occasionally between 0100 and 0700 LST at the downwind station compared to the location upwind of the wind farm. The maximum difference (cooling) attributed to the wind farm of about 3.6C occurred at 1300 LST and maximum warming was less than 1C at about 0200 LST. Similarly, Smith et al. (2013) report temperature measurements taken southwest and northeast of a large wind farm in the Midwest region of the USA during a 48day period in spring 2012. No observable impact was reported for daytime vertical potential temperature gradients within 2 km of the boundary of the wind farm. However, nighttime warming of 1.61.9C at 2.5 m above the surface was attributed to the wind farm.;Wider scale studies of regional and global impacts of wind farms are mostly limited to reports of remotely sensed nearby surface temperature differences and modelling studies of regional and global weather patterns attributable to wind farms. For example, satellitebased remotely sensed surface radiating temperatures in regions containing wind farms are reported by Zhou et al. (2012) for west central Texas, WalshThomas et al. (2012) for the much smaller San Gorgonia Pass wind farm in California and Harris et al. (2014) over Iowa. The study by Zhou et al. (2012) over the period 20032011 was conducted in an area where four of the worlds largest wind farms are located. The land surface temperature reported was derived from surface emission and was closely related to land surface radiative properties. A statistically significant temperature difference of about 1C within the wind farm compared to surrounding regions at night (2230 and 0130 LST) was found, but warming during the daytime (1030 and 1330 LST) was much weaker. Zhou et al. (2012) also reported satellite measurements of a statistically significant nighttime warming trend of up to 0.72C per decade over the years that the wind farm was built, compared to surrounding regions with no wind farms. In a followon paper, Zhou et al. (2013) reported seasonal land surface temperature anomalies for the same Texas location and times as the previous paper, derived from moderateresolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra and Aqua satellites. In this paper, they found a warming effect of 0.310.70C during nighttime for the nineyear period in all seasons, although the warming was larger in summer than spring and autumn (fall).
