Up to now, there is seemingly no evidence for populationwide effects of displacement. The lack of evidence is at least partly due to the fact that only very few studies have tried to cast light on the cumulative effects of wind farms. Cumulative effects are likely to become stronger in future because the number of wind farms and the area occupied by wind farms will greatly increase within the coming years. Wind energy is seen as one of the most feasible waysof producing electricity without using fossil or nuclear resources. Increasing the share of renewable energy to reduce the speed of climate change is on the political agenda of many governments around the globe. Wind farms have a local impact on bird species with an unfavourable conservation status, such as the Eurasian Curlew, now listed as near threatened in the Global Red List of the IUCN (IUCN 2014). To avoid damage to populations of endangered and protected bird species, the magnitude of cumulative effects has to be studied before the next wave of wind farm developments takes place. One challenge for future studies is not only to address the impacts of adding more wind farms to the landscape but also to include the effects of other humaninduced threats such as changes in land use. Studies of avoidance that add significantly to the current knowledge will probably have to be on a large scale to include cumulative effects, comprehensive to include interactions with other factors and long lasting to study habituation.;Table 7.9 Common and scientific names associated with species codes used in Figure 7.3, Figure 7.5 and Figure 7.6.
