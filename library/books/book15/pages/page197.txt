P gives the results of binomial tests (ns not significant). Bold figures indicate predominantly negative effects. BACI beforeafter controlimpact GI gradient impact b breeding season nb nonbreeding season.;Within the Anseriformes, the order most impacted by displacement, many species of swans, geese and ducks migrate from Arctic or subarctic breeding grounds to resting or wintering sites in temperate regions where they rest, forage and sleep in open landscapes and thus frequently encounter wind farms. Most Anseriform birds generally seem to be very sensitive to disturbance by tall features in open landscapes (Ballasus  Sossinka 1997 Spilling 1998), especially wind farms (Winkelman 1989 1992 Kruckenberg  Jaene 1999 Sinning  Gerjets 1999 Walter  Brux 1999 Larsen  Madsen 2000 Everaert et al. 2002 Schreiber 2002). All studies, including those with BACI and GI designs, show that geese in particular avoid resting or feeding close to wind farms during the nonbreeding season. Ducks also avoid the proximity of wind farms during the nonbreeding season. The results, however, were not significant in BACI and GI studies. The only grazing duck species, Eurasian Wigeon Anas penelope, showed the strongest response, although more aquatic species also tended to avoid wind farms (Table 7.1). Breeding ducks, however, seemed to be much less affected (Table 7.4). Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis showed strong avoidance of wind farms on their wintering grounds in Germany (Figure 7.1), but no such effect on a staging ground in Sweden where food resources were limited (Percival 1998 2005 Kowallik  BorbachJaene 2001).
