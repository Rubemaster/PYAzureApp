Pronghorn Antilocapra americana (e.g. Taylor 2014). Therefore, knowledge about the potential effects from wind power on terrestrial mammals, particularly the larger species, is in increasing demand from conservation bodies, wildlife managers, hunters, and indigenous and other local communities (e.g. Brotas  Oliveira 2011 Mockrin  Gravenmier 2012 Swedish Environmental Protection Agency 2014).;Figure 10.1 In northern Europe and Sweden in particular, wind farms are increasingly built in otherwise undisturbed boreal forest landscapes that provide habitat for a range of mammals including large ungulates and carnivores. (Jan Olof Helldin);This chapter reviews the understanding of the potential effects of wind power construction and operation on wild (i.e. excluding semidomestic populations of species such as Reindeer Rangifer tarandus) terrestrial nonflying mammals. Owing to the limited availability of studies of wind power per se, attempts were also made to utilise lessons from studies of related exploitation projects, principles from the wider ecological literature and the potential for similar effects on better studied taxa such as birds. This review is based mainly on peerreviewed scientific publications retrieved through searches in Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar conducted in 2011 and in 2014. In addition, the authors incorporated some recent relevant technical reports and conference papers after making an assessment of their scientific quality based on the presentation of original data, methods and analyses used and robustness of the conclusions. As such, only those reports that the authors considered to be reliable were included. Finally, priorities
