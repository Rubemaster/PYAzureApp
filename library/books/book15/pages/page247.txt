Despite the scope for considerable variation between studies, the results of this overview compare favourably with the carcass removal experiments of Doty and Martin (2013), which suggested that the mortality rate was within the range of 0.367.7 birds per turbine per year at a single pilot turbine over one year in sub Saharan Africa. Similarly, Bull et al. (2013) suggested a mortality rate of 4.645.38 bird collisions per turbine per year in New Zealand. Of more significance, there is also reasonable agreement with the largescale study of Zimmerling et al. (2013), who estimated collision mortality using data from carcass searches for 43 wind farms comprising 2,955 turbines across Canada, incorporating correction factors for scavenger removal, searcher efficiency and carcasses that fell beyond the area searched. On average, 8.21.4 birds were killed per turbine per year at these sites, with the numbers at individual wind farms varying from 0 to 26.9 birds per turbine per year. Accordingly, it was estimated that 23,300 birds (95 confidence interval 20,000 to 28,300) would be killed from collisions with wind turbines each year. A review of bird mortality in wind farms in the contiguous USA (Loss et al. 2013) estimated that between 140,000 and 328,000 birds are killed annually at monopole turbines. Erickson et al. (2014) produced similarestimates, predicting the annual loss of 134,000230,000 small passerines at all wind energy facilities in the USA and Canada. This equates to 2.103.35 small birds per megawatt of installed capacity.;The number of birds colliding per megawatt, calculated from the studies listed in Table 8.1 (11 studies actually present values), was generally lower than this, with a range from 0.01 to 6.21. Using the mean value from any studies with a range of values (as above), the overall mean1 SE value was 1.851.01. Including the much larger values of 27.75 and 61.96 birds per megawatt per year reported by the study of Smallwood in Box 8.3 in part of the APWRA increases the mean1 SE value to 6.383.5 birds per megawatt per year. The reason for the scale of the difference between the Smallwood (Box 8.3) study and other studies may be linked to the particularly intensive attempt to account for detectability biases, such as those caused by scavenging, searching efficiency and search radius (Bernardino et al. 2013 Huso  Dalthorp 2014) (see also Chapter 4 in volume 2), although the other studies referenced also attempted to correct for scavenger removal and searcher efficiency in their calculations (e.g. Zimmerling et al. 2013). Variation between studies may also be caused by seasonal and interannual differences in mortality rate stemming from the duration of searches. To detect all species, Smallwood and Thelander (2008) note that carcass monitoring needed to be conducted for at least 3 years. The high values presented by Smallwood may also be linked to the selection of turbines that were known to have high fatality rates, and especially that these were smaller, older generation turbines that tend to record relatively high collision rates for relatively little power output (see Turbines, below). Any differences in rates of collision between studies will also depend on a range of factors, from the types of birds present and their relative vulnerabilities (see Speciesspecific factors, below) to the nature of the terrain and the configuration of the wind farm and its turbines (see Wind farm factors, below).
