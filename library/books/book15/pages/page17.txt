However, it was the climate change research undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s that led to the development of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the Rio Convention on Climate Change and Biodiversity in 1992. Following the Rio Convention, targets were set for ratifying countries to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as defined by the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997 and came into legal force in 2005. This protocol requires that a number of industrialised countries reduce their GHG emissions by an average of 5 below 1990 levels during the first commitment period of 2008 to 2012, with additionalreduction in the second period from 2013 to 2020 (UNFCCC 2015a). The protocol has been described as a historic first step to controlling GHG and provided a basic framework around action to combat climate change. Importantly, it has led many industrialised countries to put in place the policies and action plans needed to achieve emissions cuts. For example, the European Union (EU) has made commitments to a reduction of 20 by 2020, discussed further below, and China, the worlds biggest emitter of carbon dioxide (Oliver et al. 2012), created a National Action Plan on Climate Change in 2007.;The Paris Agreement of the UNFCCC in December 2015 is set to have the same impact as the Kyoto Protocol, with almost 200 world leaders pledging commitments to reducing GHG emissions and holding the increase in global average temperatures to below 2C over preindustrial levels (UNFCCC 2015b). These targets will be reviewed on a fiveyearly basis from 2020 with an aim of achieving GHG emissions neutrality (net zero anthropogenic GHG emissions) in the second half of the century. A move towards the use of renewable energy is therefore essential to achieving this aim. Encouragingly, the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21) reports that more than 160 countries have established renewable energy targets and support policies in place, including feedin tariffs, tax credits, green certificates, mandatory targets, capital cost subsidies, and support for research, development and demonstration (REN21 2015).;Wind power is an important component of the renewable energy mix. Although it only contributes about 3 to global renewables when considered alongside hydroelectric and biomass Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) 2015b, it is a significant contributor in markets where there is a good resource. Wind power accounted for more than 50 of renewable energy generation during 2014 in the UK and provided 10 of national electricity requirements (RenewableUK 2015b). In the same year, wind power accounted for nearly 40 of Denmarks national demand (GWEC 2015b), while cumulatively across Europe it meets just over 10 of EU electricity requirements (European Wind Energy Association 2015).
