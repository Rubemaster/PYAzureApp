Wolf packs show a complex response to wind farm development, involving a decrease in breeding success and a shift in denning sites to resume regular reproduction. Such effects raise concern, particularly where the availability of suitable breeding sites is a limiting factor and cumulative effects of other threats (e.g. additional infrastructure, human caused wolf mortality) may affect the population. This is particularly relevant in endangered wolf populations occurring in highly humanised and heterogeneous landscapes, such as in Portugal. On the evidence presented here, a precautionary approach of protecting known wolf breeding sites from wind power development should be adopted (i.e. as noconstruction areas) to minimise the negative effects of wind farms on wolves. Further longterm monitoring studies should also be conducted to evaluate both the degree of tolerance of wolves toexisting wind farms and the role of cumulative effects from other human activities in wolf population viability.;Figure 10.4 Breeding occurrence and breeding site selection in two wolf packs affected by the Portuguese wind farms (a) Serra da Nave wind farm within the territory of pack A (b) Alto Minho wind farm within the territory of pack B. The black line is the cumulative number of breeding sites, and grey bars indicate the distance from breeding sites to the nearest wind turbine (for the preconstruction phase, distances are given to future turbines). The identity of the annual breeding site is shown at the bottom of each part of the figure, with A1A3 for pack A and B1B5 for pack B. ND no data available NB no breeding detected probable breeding site from indirect evidence of pups, such as a high intensity of territorial marking at a previously known breeding site.
