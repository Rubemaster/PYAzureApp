Figure 3.1 Example of a new access opening to a planned turbine or other infrastructure. (Bio3);Figure 3.2 Examples of large machinery operating on a construction site. (Bio3);At the end of the construction phase, landscape restoration is usually undertaken to promote a more integrated landscape. This usually consists of simple actions that favour the natural regeneration of vegetation, such as terrain modelling and spreading topsoil in the targeted areas, and sometimes includes seeding.;During the operational phase several further activities are carried out. The operation of the wind turbine and substation requires the constant presence of maintenance workers, implying the frequent transit of vehicles and people into the area. The need to perform periodic maintenance in the wind farm, especially in relation to the turbines, implies the frequent presence of skilled technicians. Likewise, the maintenance of underground cable networks can necessitate frequent vegetation removal and site disturbance.
