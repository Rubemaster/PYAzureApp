Any effects documented in the chapters effectively fell into two groups direct effects where some aspect of the turbines and associated infrastructure, including roads and buildings, affects the distribution or abundance of organisms in some way and indirect effects where some change to ecological form or functioning ultimately leads to an effect upon a species or taxonomic group of interest, but often via a circuitous route through the foodweb. Obvious direct effects include disturbance and displacement and collision with blades (and other structures), whereas indirect effects result could result from changes in hydrology and soil structure, the introduction of alien competitors or predators, and increased human access. The distinction between direct and indirect effects is blurred
