Guillen et al. 2008 Bhm et al. 2011). In the USA, insectivorous bats are estimated to provide ecological services worth billions of dollars per year (Boyles et al. 2011). In tropical and subtropical regions, bats take on additional ecological roles, including as pollinators and seed dispersers (e.g. Medellin  Gaona 1999 Henry  Jouard 2007 Fleming et al. 2009). Whether these types of bats are, or will be, subject to fatalities at wind turbines is unknown as there are few data from the appropriate regions (Table 9.1). However, some fruit and nectarfeeding bats do undertake long migratory movements (e.g. Thomas 1983 Fleming  Eby 2003 Richter  Cumming 2008 Roberts et al. 2012), a behaviour associated with fatalities of many insectivorous bats at turbines (Table 9.1). To date, at least two species of fruiteating bats have been found dead around turbines (Table 9.1).;Table 9.1 Species of bats killed at wind turbines in various geographic areas, and characteristics of those species.a
