The past decade has seen unprecedented deployment of wind power worldwide driven by renewable energy targets established in more than 160 countries Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21) 2015. The World Wind Energy Association (WWEA 2015) reports a global installed capacity of nearly 370,000 megawatts (MW) of wind power, the majority of which is distributed across Asia, North America and Europe (Figure 1.1). At the time of writing, China is the world leader, generating over 30 of global wind power, followed by the USA, Germany, Spain and India, with emerging markets in Brazil and Africa. Furthermore, themajority of the generation is from onshore wind, with only 2.5 being generated offshore by the end of 2014 Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) 2015a, although the huge potential for offshore wind should be noted (see Wildlife and Wind Farms Conflicts and Solutions, Volume 2 Offshore).;Figure 1.1 (a) Global distribution of installed wind power capacity (MW) by region (b) installed wind power capacity (MW) for the top ten countries.
