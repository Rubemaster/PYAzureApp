At the time of writing (11 December 2014), the bird register comprised 126 species and nine species groups (victims not identified to species level). Many species (31) were registeredwith one record only and of the 333 species regularly occurring in Germany (personal selection), 207 were not listed. The register is dominated by raptors, with Common Buzzard the most often reported species, followed by Red Kite and White tailed Eagle (Figure 8.1). As a species population size is one of the factors influencing the abundance of victims listed, a simple collision index has been calculated. First, population size was determined by assigning the maximum number of individuals of a species regularly occurring in Germany to one of the following abundance classes 199 100999 1,0009,999 10,00099,999 100,000999,999 1,000,0009,999,999 or 10,000,00099,999,999 data from Sudfeldt et al. (2013) and Hppop et al. (2013). The index of collision risk was then calculated for each species by dividing the mean of listed collision victims by the harmonic mean of the respective population abundance class. Multiplication by 10,000 then followed to avoid extremely small numbers. The collision index emphasises the susceptibility of raptors to collisions with wind turbines (Figure 8.2). Besides raptors, owls equally emerge as a group with relatively high collision indices. Some species with very low populations in Germany, such as Great White Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus and Alpine Swift Apus melba, score relatively high collision indices.;Figure 8.2 Collision indices per bird species based on the German wind turbine collision register as of 11 December 2014.
