JEFFREY E. LOVICH and JOSHUA R. ENNEN;A review was conducted of all the peerreviewed scientific publications that could be found on the known and potential effects of wind farm development, operation, maintenance and decommissioning on reptiles and amphibians (collectively herpetofauna) worldwide. Both groups are declining globally owing to a multitude of threats, including energy development. Effect studies were limited to the longterm research by the authors on Agassizs Desert Tortoise ecology and behaviour at a single operational wind farm in California, USA, and an analysis of the effects of wind farm installation on the species richness of vertebrates, including reptiles and amphibians, in northwestern Portugal. Research on Agassizs Desert Tortoise found few demonstrable differences in biological parameters between populations in the wind farm and those in more natural habitats. High reproductive output is due to the regional climate and not to the presence or operation of the wind farm. Site operations have resulted in death and injury to a small number of adult tortoises and over the long term tortoises now appear to avoid the areas of greatest turbine concentration. Research in Portugal using models and simulations based on empirical data shows that vertebrate species richness (including herpetofauna) decreased by almost 20 after the installation of only two large monopole turbines per 250  250 m plot. Knowledge of the known responses of herpetofauna to various disturbances allows identification of potential impacts from construction material acquisition in offsite areas, mortality and stress due to impacts of roads and related infrastructure, destruction and modification of habitat, habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow, noise, vibration, electromagnetic field generation, heat from buried highvoltage transmission lines,
