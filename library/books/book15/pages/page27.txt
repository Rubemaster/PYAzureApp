Figure 1.7 A domestic wind turbine providing power to a residential property. (Nick Bristow);The WWEA reports that globally, 806,000 small wind turbines were in operation by 2012 (WWEA 2014), with over 25,000 small and mediumsized wind systems reported in the UK alone (RenewableUK 2015a). With inevitable advances in the manufacturing processes, the cost of these turbines is likely to decrease and one would imagine that their deployment would increase accordingly. Crucially, the small to mediumsized wind market provides the diversity of scale to allow a wider range of society to implement renewable energy options to suit their needs, thus reducing our reliance on energy from fossil fuels.;The term wind farm generally refers to more than two wind turbines connected to the national electricity grid. Modern wind farms tend to comprise turbines that generate more than 1 MW, and typically 2 MW of power. As wind farms are only as productive as the wind resource that powers them, they tend to be sited at elevated and exposed locations where there are good average wind speeds and a minimum of obstacles and obstructions such as trees, hills and other buildings to affect the wind resource. Other important aspects of their siting include sufficient separation from
