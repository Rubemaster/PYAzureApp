SD standard deviation. The equation (Minimum distance  Coefficient  Wind turbine height  Exponent) demonstrates the relationship between the total height of wind turbines and the minimum avoidance distance of birds. F values of the analyses of variance to verify the regression coefficients. P gives the significance of the analyses of variance (ns not significant).;Part of the variation within species can be explained by the fact that different studies took place at wind farms that differed in the heights of turbines. Modern wind turbines tend to be much taller than those installed several years ago. It could be that disturbance due to tall turbines is much greater than that of smaller turbines. Madsen and Boertmann (2008) and Scheller and Vlker (2007) suggested an impact of turbine height on staging Pinkfooted Geese Anser brachyrhynchus and Common Cranes Grus grus, respectively.;Table 7.8 shows that outside the breeding season, 16 out of 23 species showed an increase in minimum avoidance distance with increased turbine size. The results were statistically significant for Northern Lapwing (Figure 7.4), Golden Plover, Carrion Crow Corvus corone, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris and finches. Lower disturbance by taller turbines was found in species or species groups that are sensitive to disturbance, such as Eurasian Wigeon, Common
