Figure 3.5 Mobilisation of dust from vehicle traffic along an unpaved road in a Portuguese wind farm. (Bio3);Dust deposition may cause negative effect on vegetation, in a physical andor chemical way. Farmer (1993) provides a comprehensive review of the effects of dust on plants and vegetation communities. It is important to understand that dust consists of solid matter in a fine state of subdivision, so that the particles are small enough to be mobilised and carried on the wind. Several characteristics of dust, including its source, particle size and chemical composition, are important in this respect and its subsequent effect. In simple terms, dust may physically smother the leaves, depending on the absolute level of deposition, which is affected by dust emission rates, meteorology and conditions on the leaf surface. Rates of dust deposition affected by factors such as surface roughness and rain. An increase in surface roughness causes a significant increase in deposition rates (Belot et al. 1976 Farmer 1993). Conversely, wet surfaces can cause increased deposition (Chamberlain et al. 1967 Farmer 1993). Thus, while rain may partially wash leaves clean of deposited dust, the resulting wet surfaces may then experience higher deposition rates.;A wide variety of tree species (e.g. European Alder Alnus glutinosa, European Ash Fraxinus excelsior, Silver Birch Betula pendula and Catawba Rosebay Rhododendron catawbiense) have been studied in their response to the effects of urban road dust (Farmer 1993). The responses studied have been limited to a reduction in photosynthesis and diffuse resistance and an increase in leaf temperature, the last two effects making the tree more susceptible to drought. This may be exacerbated by the dusted leaves allowing greater penetration of road salt, which further increases water stress
