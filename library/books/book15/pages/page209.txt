Snipe, Blacktailed Godwit Limosa limosa, Eurasian Curlew and Common Redshank Tringa totanus. Why taller turbines cause less displacement is not known, although the visual field of the birds may play a role. The rotor tips of larger turbines are farther away from birds on the ground and the relative speed of the rotors may be perceived to be slower and less disturbing. It is of interest that during the breeding season there were no statistically significant relationships between avoidance distance and hub height.;Figure 7.4 Relationship between minimum distances maintained by Northern Lapwings from wind turbines outside the breeding season in relation to hub height. Each of the 36 studies from Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands is represented by a rhombus. (Adapted from Htker et al. 2005);Besides avoiding being close to a wind farm when breeding, feeding or roosting, birds can avoid close proximity to wind turbines when in flight. Wind farms can therefore pose obstacles to flying birds that they avoid by increasing their flight height, by making a detour around the wind farm or by interrupting or reversing their flight. This socalled barrier effect can occur during migration (de Lucas et al. 2004) or in relation to other more regular flights, such as when commuting between feeding, roosting and nesting sites (Dirksen et al. 2000). As a result of barrier effects, flight times can become longer and energetic costs of travelling can increase.;Barrier effects have been reported for many species (Htker 2008) and the phenomenon seems to be very widespread. There are many casual observations of flocks of migrating birds becoming disorganised when approaching a wind farm (Koop 1999 Isselbcher  Isselbcher 2001). In only very few cases, however, have barrier effects been systematically studied (de Lucas et al. 2004 BioConsult SH  ARSU 2010), and there are also many examples of birds overflying wind farms without any sign of
