Following scoping and agreement on the focus of the EIA, the next stage is data acquisition to describe the existing environment. Although this may be achieved through a review of existing data, there is usually a need to acquire new data through survey and census. The European EIA Directive (Box 1.2) specifies the need to consider the following receptors human beings, fauna and flora, soil, water, air, climate and the landscape, material assets, cultural heritage and the interaction between these receptors.;Depending on the scale of the proposed project, and with respect to species sensitive to wind farm construction and operation or protected species in particular, there is generally a need to undertake surveys during key seasons or periodically over a 12 month period. In some cases, it may be necessary to undertake surveys over several seasons or years to establish interannual variation. As mentioned earlier, it is good policy to ensure that the methodologies used to collect and analyse data are agreed with the regulator and appropriate stakeholders to mitigate their challenge at the application stage.;The results of survey and deskbased studies are then used to describe the existing environment against which the potential direct and indirect, positive and negative impacts of the proposed project will be assessed. A key conclusion of this activity is identification of the sensitivity of the existing environment to the proposed project. Typically, the environment is comprised of a number of receptors, which could be habitats or even key ecosystem functions such as the ability to retain water in the case of a wetland, although individual species often become the focus of interest. The sensitivity of a receptor is a function of its capacity to accommodate change and reflects its ability to recover if it is affected. The sensitivity of the receptor is therefore quantified through a number of factors, including adaptability, tolerance, recoverability and value.
