Finally, the impact of wind farms on birds must also be viewed in the context of the possible impact of climate change in the absence of wind farms. Some authors have contextualised the mortality caused by wind farms (Calvert et al. 2013 Erickson et al. 2014) and it appears to be lower than the mortality produced with other humanmade structures, such as power lines, buildings, communication towers or even traffic. Furthermore, Sovacool (2009 2013) assessed and compared the avian deaths per gigawatt hour from three electricity systems wind farms, fossilfuelled powerplants (coal, natural gas and oil generators) and nuclear power plants. These works showed that fossil fuels and nuclear power plants were more dangerous to avian wildlife than wind farms, suggesting that the most visible impacts from a given technology are not always the most egregious.;We would like to thank Beatriz Martn, Alejandro Onrubia and Carlos Torralvo (from Migres Foundation, Spain), Espen Lie Dahl (from NINA, Norway), Shawn Smallwood (USA), Hermann Htker (from MichaelOttoInstitut im NABU, Germany) and Tobias Drr (from Landesamt fr Umwelt, Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz Brandenburg, Staatliche Vogelschutzwarte) for their collaboration in this chapter.
