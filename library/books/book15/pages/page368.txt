Ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus variegatus, an endemic subspecies of Willow Ptarmigan found on coastal islands in central Norway, was high on the list of dead birds found at the power plant (Figure 11.6).;Figure 11.6 Number of bird collision victims recorded close to the wind turbines in the Smla wind farm in different years. Wetland birds comprised waders, ducks, geese, swans and Grey Heron Ardea cinerea, whereas coastal birds included gulls, auks and Northern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialis. (Redrawn from Bevanger et al. 2008);Smla Willow Ptarmigan has been protected on Smla from 2005 as a result of its small population size. The wider population of Willow Ptarmigan has also been in decline in recent years (see Henriksen  Hilmo 2015). The possible negative effects of the planned rapid increase in wind farms both in coastal areas in Norway as well as alpine and subalpine areas in Scandinavia (see httpwww.energinorge.no) on Willow Ptarmigan need to be addressed. Recent studies of grouse in relation to windpower plants document both mortality due to collision and displacement due to disturbance (Pruett et al. 2009 Zeiler  GrnschachnerBerger 2009).;A radiotracking study was initiated by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA) to compare mortality in the coastal Smla Willow Ptarmigan population inside the wind farm area and outside it in a control area, in addition to possible displacement from the wind farm. In 20082010, 34 Willow Ptarmigan (19 males and 15 females) were fitted with lightweight (1012 g) necklace VHF radio transmitters equipped with threehour mortality sensors (Holohill) (Figure 11.7). The birds were radiotracked at irregular intervals and almost all birds, when found, were located within the wind farm area.
