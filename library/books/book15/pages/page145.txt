Despite potential significant adverse effects, most of the conflicts between wind farms and the aquatic environment can potentially be avoided or mitigated through careful project design and management. This is partly because the overall footprint of a wind farm is usually relatively small. It is already recognised that wind energy developments can bring local biodiversity benefits (EC 2011), and it is possible that the development of a wind farm instigating suitable water quality protection mitigation could bring longterm benefits to the receiving aquatic environment, particularly on sites that are already disturbed and have existing erosion issues. Research is needed, however, and there is an almost complete absence of pre and postconstruction studies in relation toimpacts on aquatic ecosystems. Indeed, such studies are rare for wind farm projects (Kuvlesky et al. 2007). Millidine et al. (2015) recommended that future work in relation to assessing the impacts of wind farm developments on aquatic habitats should consider assessing the effects of contrasting (size, design) wind farm developments across a broad environmental range (rainfall, geology, soils) with a range of contractors using a comparable BACI style design.;Ahtiainen, M.
