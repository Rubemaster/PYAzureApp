Unfortunately, little is known about the degree to which invertebrates are attracted to wind farms, whether areas of high invertebrate abundance and diversity tend to overlap with desirable wind farm sites, the scale of any impacts of wind farms on local invertebrate populations, or whether changes in invertebrate populations around wind farms affect plants and other animals. Answering these questions will be critical to both siting and operating wind farms such that they maximise power production and minimise potential wildlife impacts. Welldesigned studies that investigate how capturing wind may affect these animals will help planners and operators to site and manage future development.;Sarah Elzay was supported by a Bureau of Land Management grant to Michael E.
