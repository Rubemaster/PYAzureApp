156 A. Rauh et al.ways. First the 10min speeds Ui are inserted into the empirical power curve function;An inspection of Fig. 27.3 indicates that LPC significantly overestimates the power output  L exp, in particular since in the region of the plateau most data points have to be shifted by a relatively large distance from below onto the power curve. As a matter of fact, due to safety reasons, power output is kept limited near the rated power. Also in the large time interval of 24 h our power curve average overestimates  L exp, i.e., by 17. In comparison with this, the Tjareborg power curve, available in the world wide Web 4, overestimates the same 24h data by about 8.;One reason for this difference may lie in the fact that our 24 h data base forestablishing the power curve is rather small. However, in both cases neglection of the finite response time causes systematic errors.;d dtL(t)  r(t) LPC(U(t))  L(t)  r(t)  0, (27.4)where LPC denotes the power curve and U(t), L(t) the instantaneous wind speed and power, respectively. Because the relaxation function r(t) is posi tive, the above model exhibits the attraction property of the power curve. In principle, the model could be nonlinearly extended by adding uneven powers of LPC(U(t))  L(t) with positive coefficients to preserve attraction.;Thus, the average based on the power curve predicts the true meanpower output, provided the averaging time T is much larger than the relaxation time   1r0. To see this, one integrates (27.4) from time t  0 to T
