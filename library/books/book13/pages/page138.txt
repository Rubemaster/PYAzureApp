Fig. 20.3. Atmospheric PDFs Symbols represent the normalized PDFs of the atmospheric data sets. Straight lines correspond to a fit of distributions according to (20.4). All graphs are vertically shifted against each other for clarity of presentation. Left sonic anemometer From top to bottom  takes the values 0.5 s, 2.5 s, 25 s, 250 s and 4, 000 s. Right hotwire anemometer From top to bottom  takes the values 2 ms, 20 ms, 200 ms and 2, 000 ms;Fig. 20.3. Atmospheric PDFs Symbols represent the normalized PDFs of the atmospheric data sets.

In both cases the scale dependent statistics can be described with 20.4.;Atmospheric velocity increments and their occurrence statistics are related to loads on wind turbines. For constructing wind turbines a model that reproduces the right increment distributions for every location should therefore be used. Our approach is a good candidate to achieve such a robust model.;1. U. Frisch Turbulence. The Legacy of A.N. Kolmogorov, Cambridge University;2. B. Castaing, Y. Gagne, E.J.
