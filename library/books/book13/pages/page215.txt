Fig. 36.2. Vorticity contours at two timeinstants during upstrokedamping. If these loops are travelled in anticlockwise sense, the situation is stable, i.e. energy is shifted from the blade into the surrounding fluid. However if the loop is traversed in the clockwise sense (see indication in Fig. 36.2) an unstable flow condition occurs and energy is transferred from the flow to the blade structure. This is a critical situation insofar as dangerous stall flutter may occur. Figure 36.2 shows the calculated details of the vorticals flow at two instants of time during the upstroke motion. In the left figure the vortex has just been created close to the blade leading edge, has started to travel along the upper surface but is still attached to the surface. In this phase the vortex creates extra lift (see Fig. 36.1). Very short time later (right sequence of Fig. 36.2) the vortex has been lifted off the blade surface, stall has been started and neg ative vorticity is created at the blade trailing edge moving forward underneath the Dynamic Stall Vortex. In this phase the complex flow phenomenon occur which cause the strong decay of lift and creation of negative aerodynamic damping.;In October 2004 DLR has done experiments in the DNWTWG wind tunnel facility located at the DLRCentre in Gottingen. These tests are part of the DLRONERA joint project Dynamic Stall. Within this project it was de cided to use the OA209 (9 thickness) airfoil section as the standard airfoil. The OA209 airfoil is in use on a variety of flying helicopters. Measurements on a 0.3 m chord and 1 m span blade model (extended between wind tunnel sidewalls) have been carried out. The objectives of these almost full size tests have been to study the details of the dynamic stall process by both numerical
