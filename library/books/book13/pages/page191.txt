31 Characterisation of the Power Curve for Wind Turbines 175where (t) is the deterministic relaxation of the fluctuations, which growth and decay exponentially, on the stationary power Lfix(u). The term g(L, t)(t) describes the influence of dynamical noise from the system, e.g. shutdown states, pitchangle control, yaw errors, etc. 5.;To obtain the stationary power curve by means of fixed points, the stochastic temporal state nvector L(t)  (L(t1), L(t2), ..., L(tn)) is assumed to be statio nary for wind velocity intervals ua  u  ub with an time evolution  which is described by an onedimensional Langevinequation 3,4;To obtain the stationary power curve by means of fixed points, the stochastic temporal state nvector L(t)  (L(t1), L(t2), ..., L(tn)) is assumed to be statio nary for wind velocity intervals ua  u  ub with an time evolution  which is described by an onedimensional Langevinequation 3,4d dtL(t)  D(1)(L) ;The analysis was based on measured data of about 1.6  106 samples of elect. power output and wind speed at hub hight of a WEC of 2 MW 5. First, D(1)(L) was evaluated in a width of the wind velocity bins of 0.5 m s1 and power bins of 40 kW. Next, the fixed points of the power were found by search ing the minD. We show evidence that the power exhibited multiple fixed points for u  20 m s1 where the wind generator was switched to other rated speed change by means of a maximal power extraction (optimal opera tion), e.g. Fig. 31.2. Finally, all fixed points of the power were reconstructed and presented in a twodimensional vector field analysis D(1)(L, u) of the deterministics dynamics of power and wind velocity, respectively, Fig. 31.3.
