Summary. At the University of Braunschweig the effects of ultrasonic peening (UP) and shot peening on the fatigue life and fatigue strength of new and existing wind energy plants have been investigated. The test results demonstrate that UP is an effective and practical means to extend their service life.;The design of wind energy converters is significantly defined by fatigue. In the coming years a large number of converters will reach their designed service life of 20 years, so that methods to increase their fatigue life are required. At the University of Braunschweig research has been initiated on the application of ultrasonic peening and shot peening to increase the fatigue life of new and existing wind energy plants.;The effectiveness of weld improvement methods to increase the fatigue life has been investigated in several studies. Methods known are local or overall grinding, burr grinding, TIGdressing, needle peening, hammer peening, shot peening, UP or ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT). Methods which combine geometric and mechanical effects show the best fatigue strength improvement. A large amount of data from literature show that SN curves of improved specimens run flatter than the SN curves of untreated specimens 1. So far, only few empirical investigations on the effectiveness of UP on the increase of the preloaded specimens are available 2.
