The new generation of large wind turbines, which is specifically designed for Offshore application, is now in the prototyping phase. The currently largest wind turbine REpower 5M is in operation since autumn 2004. First offshore prototypes of this type shall be installed in 2006. This paper focuses on the mechanical and structural issues related to large Offshore Wind turbines. Other challenging areas  like electrical engineering, financing or operation and maintenance  are not discussed.;Due to the demanding offshore environment with a reduced accessibility, the main emphasis in the development is an economic design of the turbine with a high reliability and a high availability. The REpower 5M is based on proven technology and can be regarded as a logical evolutionary step compared to the smaller turbines. This is a significant difference compared to other large wind turbines which are based on new concepts but does not have a proven track record.;Rated power is 5,000 kW (5 MW) with a rotor diameter of 126 m. The pro totype has been installed on a steel tower with a hub height of 120 m. The turbine has been designed for strong wind sites with an annual mean wind speed of 10.5 ms1 at hub height.
