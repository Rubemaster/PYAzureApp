x2 j (48.1)where fbody represents the force extraction from the blades. To avoid numerical instabilities, the forces are distributed among neigh bouring node points using a Gaussian distribution.;The result from the CFD simulation is evaluated and special attention is paid to the circulation and the position of vortices. From the evaluation, it will hopefully be possible to improve the engineering methods and base them, to a greater extent, on physical features instead of empirical corrections. Since the actuator line method uses tabulated airfoil data from measurements, data with good quality must be used. Data from the turbine Tjaereborg has been used for all simulations in this project 6. The performed simulations are carried out in cylindrical coordinates and the mesh is reduced to a 120 slice with periodic boundary conditions to account for the rest of the required cylinder volume (see Fig. 48.1). The simulations are performed for steady conditions only. The mesh was created as a 5block mesh to be able to capture large gradi ents in the wake. To evaluate the sensitivity of the grid four different meshes with different resolutions were constructed 48, 64, 80, and 96 nodes on each;Fig. 48.1. The 5block mesh and the distribution of the nodes. There are 96 nodes on each block side. In total this mesh contains 963  5  4.4  106 nodes
