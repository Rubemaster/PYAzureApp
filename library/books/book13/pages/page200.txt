It is necessary to note also, that for all considered flow velocities thehydrotray rotors with controlled blades have selfstarted, while rotors with rigidly fixed blades must be spin upped, i.e., certain auxiliary torque M must be applied on the windrotor model shaft. Only after that a rotor continued rotation with constant revolution velocity.;The dependencies Cp on Z for windrotor models with 2, 3, and 4 blades arepresented in Fig. 33.1. It appeared, that the positional relationship of curves Cp(Z) for windrotor models with various numbers of blades essentially differ from that of similar curves for windrotor model with rigidly fixed blades. For the last, increasing number of blades leads to a shift of the right part of domeshaped curve Cp(Z) to the left (i.e., reduces rapidity of a wheel), and on the contrary happens for windrotor models with controlled blades. Here the least highspeed has appeared for the rotor with 2 blades. The greatest values of both the operating ratio of flow energy Cp and the coefficient of windrotor torque Cm ware received just for the windrotor models with 3 and 4 blades.;4 bl.fix. 3 bl.fix. 2 bl.fix. 4 bl. cont. 3 bl. cont. 2 bl. cont.;4 bl.fix. 3 bl.fix. 2 bl.fix. 4 bl. cont. 3 bl. cont. 2 bl. cont.model N1;4 bl.fix. 3 bl.fix. 2 bl.fix. 4 bl. cont. 3 bl. cont. 2 bl. cont.;Fig. 33.1.
