Any measured time series has a finite sampling rate that limits the available time increments for the limiting procedure (23.3). Hence this expression has to be extrapolated to the value   0.;(x  x0) (23.4)with L being the FokkerPlanck operator. A Taylor expansion of this expression yields;This pdf can be used for analytical calculation of the conditional moments (23.3). Eventually one can assess the deviations of the estimate of drift and diffusion D(i);Depending on the shape of drift and diffusion functions significant deviations from the intrinsic functions occur for finite . These deviations cannot be grasped with statistical considerations as they originate in the properties of the propagator for finite time.;On the other hand one has to consider the finite number of data points. Dis cretization of state space confines the number of points even more. Especially in sparsely populated regions that come along with natural boundary con ditions the low density leads to huge errors in the estimation of drift and diffusion.
