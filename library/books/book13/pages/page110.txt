Meas. on blade Veers 1D Veers 1D (dir.);Special phenomena such as microbursts or weird gusts in complex terrain are not taken into account in the simulation described above. Here constrained simulation may be of value. Constrained for wind turbines has been created recently 1 and developed further and formulated differently by Ris.;20 m (corresponding to a time 20 mU) in the center of the rotor plane is simu lated. The field is random but is required to display the sudden velocity jump. It should be emphasized that the constrained simulation is still Gaussian and that incompressibility is still obeyed 6. The threedimensional secondorder tensor behind the simulation is described in detail elsewhere 4.;Another important aspect of dynamic loads is wakes. Turbines in parks often experience large fluctuations in wind speed because an upwind turbine creates a meandering wake. Blades going in and out of this wake can, if the turbines are very close to each other, cause very large loads.;One such model is shown in Fig. 15.3 where the velocity deficit from eightturbines is advected passively by a large scale turbulent field. This field is simulated according to Mann (1998), but on a quite crude resolution. The wakes expand according to CFD calculation in essentially laminar flow.
