One result of the detail analysis is shown in Fig. 60.3. For tubular con nections hotspot stresses at the transition between brace and chord cannot be avoided. The knowledge about stress distribution enables the localization of critical areas for partial damage calculation. The size of hotspot stresses is depending on loading and tubular geometry. The hotspot stresses can be calculated by use of stress concentration factors (SCF) or by finiteelement methods. To increase the fatigue resistance of the upper central joint the hotspot stresses has to be reduced. One possible solution is shown in the right part of Fig. 60.3. Here a stress reduction is achieved by conical widening of the braces at transition. Another possibility for a construction with high fatigue resistance is worked out together with crane constructors which have many experiences in fatigue design. An analogous connection to the upper central joint is solved in conveyor technique with a ring insert. In this construction the shear forces are carried off by internal stiffeners and not by plate bending, which reduce hotspot stresses. Another effect is that the central shaft below the upper central joint is no longer needed, which also leads to an omission of the lower central joint and the lower braces. This idea of an innovative construction without lower central joint is trans ferred to a tripod foundation structure for offshore wind turbines. At first a global and a detailed model of the upper central joint without ring insert was developed, see Fig. 60.4. The braces of this structure have the bearing behaviour of bending beams. Typical for tubular connections is that hotspot stresses appear at tubular intersections. Figure 60.5 shows the results of the stress calculation for the same load case as before for a tripod structure with ring insert. Here one can see that the hotspot stresses are enormously reduced, which will lead to an efficient solution regarding fatigue design.
