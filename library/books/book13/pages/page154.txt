The trace of G is called the elliptical dimension Del. The basic 299D model has G with eigenvalues 1, 1, Hz, Ht with Hz  59, Ht  23 so that Trace G  299. An overall advection (Gallilean transformation) is taken into account by introducing offdiagonal terms in G. This generalized scale invariance (GSI) is the basic framework for defining scale in anisotropic scaling systems 6.; (r, t)   (r, t)  g (r, t)   (k, )    (k, ) g (k, ) (24.3)by convolving () (r, t) with the propagator (spacetime Greens func tion) gt(r, t) where we have indicated fourier transforms by tildes. The conserved flux  is then obtained by exponentiation;The horizontal velocity field is obtained by a final convolution with the (generally different) propagatorv (r, t)  13 (r, t)  gv (r, t)  v (k, )   13 (k, ) gv (k, ).

(24.6);The real space and fourier scale functions are different the latter is scaling with respect to the transpose of G, i.e., satisfies (24.2) with GT in place of G. H must be chosen  D(1  1) for g, and H13 for gv. h(t) is the Heaviside function necessary to account for causality.;Although the FIF is quite general, its classical implementation ( 7,8, Fig. 24.1 upper left) is obtained by using the same localized spacetime scale function for both g and gv. We now allow gv to be nonlocal in spacetime (wave packets). The key is to break R into a separate spatial and temporal parts in a frame with no advection, the classical FIF uses the strongly localized
