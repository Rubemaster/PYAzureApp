17 power law exponent varying 0.07  0.35;Fig. 30.2. Estimated power of Vestas V902.0 wind turbine at 80 m hub height for the period of 20012003 vs. the estimated production in year 2003 (left panel) and the estimation made with a stability dependent exponent (right panel);Estimation for the energy production was done using the power curve of a low cutin speed 2 MW nominal power equipment (Vestas V902.0). Results are demonstrated in Fig. 30.2 (left panel) at 80 m hub height. Compared to the windy year 2001, in 2002 and 2003 we got 18 and 68 less energy, respectively, (see Fig. 30.2 left panel). With the use of a stability dependent exponent instead of the suggested 17 one, another 12 uncertainty is intro duced into the estimation. Note that the estimation of wind energy was larger with the latter method (see Fig. 30.2).;The great interannual variability is the nature of the wind climate in the Carpathian Basin. The wind energy production of a calm year can be as little as the half of a windy one. Joint analysis of the longrange meteorological data set and wind tower measurements  for at least one year  is fundamental in the estimation of the available wind energy for a certain project.;1.
