Valery L. Okulov and Jens N. Srensen;Summary. The work is a further development of a model developed by one of the authors Okulov (J. Fluid Mech. 521319342 2004) in which linear stability of N equally azimuthally spaced infinity long helical vortices with constant pitch were considered. A multiplicity of helical vortices approximates the tip vortices of the far wake behind a wind turbine. The present analysis is extended to include an assigned vorticity field due to root vortices and the hub of the wake. Thus the tip vortices are assumed to be embedded in an axisymmetric helical vortex field formed from the circulation of the inner part of the rotor blades and the hub. As examples of inner vortex fields we consider three generic vorticity distributions (Rankine, Gaussian and Scully vortices) at radial extents ranging from the core radius of a tip vortex to several rotor radii.;The influence of an assigned flow on the stability of multiple vortices has so far only been studied for circular arrays of point vortices or straight vor tex filaments (the limiting case of a helical vortex with infinite pitch) 2, 3. A nonperturbed multiple of helical vortices (Fig. 46.1a rotates with con stant angular velocity   0  Ind  Sind and moves uniformly along its axis with velocity V  V0  VInd  VSind. Note that in contrast to the plane case, where the total vortex motion consists of an assigned flow field (0, V0) and the mutual induction of the vortices (Ind, VInd) with VInd  0, we also include selfinduction of each of helical vortex (Sind, VSind) 1. From linear stability, introducing infinitesimal space displacements rk   (t) exp (2iksN), k   (t) exp (2iksN), of the kvortex from the its equilibrium position(a, 2kN  t, V t) a correlation equation B  0 was derived for dimensionless pitch   la and vortex radius   rcorea
