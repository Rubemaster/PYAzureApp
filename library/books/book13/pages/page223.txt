Drag coefficientrR  31.6 rR  45.8 rR  65.7 rR  84.2 2D data;Lift coefficientrR  31.6 rR  45.8 rR  65.7 rR  84.2 2D data;We have now developed a general method for determining AOA. Comparisons with the AT shows good agreements. The method can also be used to extract data from experiments (for example, with Pitot tube). Moreover it can be used to study airfoil properties in the region near the tip.;1. Abbott I.H., von Doenhoff A.E. (1959) Theory of wing sections. Dover, New;2. Hansen M.O.L., Johansen J.
