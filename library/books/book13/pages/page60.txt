Summary. The flow over steep hills has been studied experimentally and numer ically. The sinusoidallyshaped hills follow the parametric shape equations of the RUSHIL experiments. In the wind tunnel of the University of Kaiserslautern the flow over the hill was measured with the Laser Doppler Anemometry. Thereby, devices had to be found in order to thicken artificially the boundary layer. The numerical investigation has been carried out using several turbulence models comparing the calculated results with the experimental ones. In order to carry out reliable wind energy power predictions recommendations concerning numerical calculations are given.;Wind speed and power predictions are of high importance when installing new wind parks, even more in complex terrain. The topographic effects on air flow cause speedups and increase velocity fluctuations which have a signifi cant influence on wind energy resource assessment and on wind loading on structures. As sites in forests are becoming interesting the flow field in and above the canopy should also be taken into account 1.;Wind speed and power are mostly forecasted using linearized models whichdo not count very well for the topographic effects. Moreover, measurements at low heights are used in order to interpolate data. The forecast is therefore of low accuracy. Though being expensive, the best method for predicting wind power is measuring the velocities on site at hub height. Additionally, the measured velocities must be correlated with a longterm measurement of at least 20 years in order to define whether the measured period is an average wind year or not 2.;The present investigation has been focused on the flow over complex terrain, especially on flow over steep hills. Though being important stratification has been neglected focusing on a neutral flow.
