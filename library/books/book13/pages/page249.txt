Fig. 43.4. Aerodynamic performances of the conventional Savonius rotor 8model represented in Fig. 43.2. The three geometric parameters e, e and  are selected for the numerical study.;ReD, based on the rotor diameter D of the rotor, has also been investigated 7. Only the influence of the overlap is presented in this paper.;The finite volume mesh obtained is about 50,000 cells large and madeof quadrilaterals. Firstorder discretisation schemes have been used for the pressure and the velocity computations of an incompressible flow, together with a high Reynolds number two equations turbulence model.;The calculations have been realised using a static calculation (rotor supposed to be fixed whatever the wind direction ) and also a dynamic calcula tion. Only the static calculation is presented here.;For the present calculation, the Reynolds number corresponds to the nominal conditions for the prototype 6 ReD  1.56  105.;A static simulation of the flow around few Savonius rotors, allowed to deter mine the pressure distribution on the paddles for different values of the wind direction . (c.f. example on Fig. 43.5). Then the static torque is calculated as a function of  (Fig. 43.6).
