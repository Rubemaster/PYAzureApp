296 P. Schaumann and F. Wilke;Fatigue design is a multiparameter challenge. The number of parameters significantly increases the sensitivity of results when applying local concepts, in particular the notch strain approach. Therefore experimental verification of the theoretical analysis is indispensable but unlikely for the extreme large dimensions of the proposed structures. Nevertheless the two local concepts show their benefits if transfer to new structures or weld types is needed. For offshore structures with actions in the highcycle region, the notch stress ap proach should be chosen. The application of the notch stress approach has shown a very good compliance with the structural stress approach for the weld toe locations, but great differences in fatigue strength for the roots. Here the design rules for singleside welded joints have to be examined in more detail with fracture mechanics.;1.
