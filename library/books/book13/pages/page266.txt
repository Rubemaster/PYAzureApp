254 A. Wessel et al.where  is the von Karman constant (set to 0.4) and zH the height above the ground.;Inside a wind farm, the downwind turbines may be subject to multiple wakes on the rotor from the upwind turbines. The model has to superimpose the wakes from the upwind turbines.;add,i, (47.3)where N is the number of upwind turbines. The effect of the incoming tur bulence intensity on the wake development of a turbine inside a wind farm is taken into account by using the modelled turbulence intensity from the upwind wind turbines as ambient turbulence for the Ainslie model.;The inertial parameters A and B of (47.1) are estimated by a fit of the model to turbulence intensity profile from the Nibe 3 onshore wind farm, described in 4. The values are A  1.42 and B  0.54.;The model has been compared with measurements of the onshore windfarms Nibe and Sexbierum with good result 4. Here a comparison to the offshore wind farm Vindeby is performed. Fixed values were used for the parameters A and B for all wind farms with good results. Although in general it could be expected, that they depend on the wind turbine and specific site.;47.2.1 Vindeby Double and Quintuple Wake;Denmark. The 11 Bonus 450 kW turbines are arranged in two rows as shown in Fig. 47.1. The Bonus 450 have a rotor diameter of 37 m and a hub height of 35 m 5.;Outside the wind farm the two measurement mast SMS and SMW areinstalled. For a wind direction of 75 a double wake situation occurs for mast SMW while the mast SMS is in the free flow. A quintuple wake is measured at mast SMS at a wind direction of 320, where SMW captures the free flow conditions.
