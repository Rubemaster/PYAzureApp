Fig. 17.5. GEV1 (red straight asymptote) and GEV2 (green convex curve) distrib utions fitted to the data of Fig. 17.4that swept across France by the end of the last century (2526121999 and 2728121999). They correspond to sharp spikes in daily wind time series at various meteorological stations (Fig. 17.1a). However, intermittent fluctua tions are also present at scales of 1 min (Fig 17.1b) and all these fluctuations respect the Kolmogorov scaling (Fig. 17.2 ab). Furthermore, their probability distributions (Fig. 17.3 ab) display a rather clear powerlaw falloff with an exponent qD  7, in agreement with previous studies. Looking to larger time scales, let us consider the yearly wind maxima in Paris area during the period of 19701999 (Fig. 17.4), as well as the fitted GEV1 and GEV2 distributions (Fig. 17.5) in the socalled Gumbel paper (i.e. wind speed vs. double logarithm of the empirical probability distribution) in which the asymptote of GEV1 is a straight line, whereas GEV2 curve remains convex. It is rather obvious, that both fits are rather equivalent up to the year 1998, whereas the latter can be only captured by the convexity of GEV2.
