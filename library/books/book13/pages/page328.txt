Fig. 60.2. Woehlercurves for butt welded plates with sealing runpresent investigations for OWEC are compared. In addition, the corresponding Woehlercurve in EC3 part 1.9 is shown for comparison 4. All Woehlercurves result from fatigue tests on butt welded plates with sealing runs. The diagram shows that the fatigue resistance for butt welded plates made of S960 is much higher. The result from the present test on 30 mm thick plates seems to fit into the Woehlercurve for 8 mm thick plates.;The IMS Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH already analysed different structural forms with varying dimensions and came up with an innovative solution for the tower of OWEC via finiteelement calculations. In the first step of the analysis a global model was calculated for the ulti mate and the fatigue limit state. This model includes all environmental loads acting on the foundation structure like wind and waves. The fatigue resistance of the joints is always the decisive design criteria for the lifetime of the struc ture. To carry out detail solutions regarding fatigue design further analyses were worked out via finiteelement calculations. For this the forces and mo ments of different load cases were transferred from the global structure to the finiteelement model. The main focus in this project lies on the construction of the upper central joint of the tripod, which is the most critical construction for fatigue design.
