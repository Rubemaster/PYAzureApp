An efficient and reliable use of offshore windenergy requires a condition con trolled maintenance. Thereby information about the state of damage and the residual load carrying capacity of the structure has to be provided by means of condition monitoring systems (CMS). Such a system is not yet available. In the following, a new method is demonstrated treating this problem. The method is based upon the fact that damages influence the dynamic behavior of elasto mechanical structures. Turek et al. 1 show that with the aid of a validated finite element model damage detection can be made by means of measured modal quantities. However, their method does not provide infor mation about quantification and localisation of damage. By formulating the identification problem as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem using the finite element model with parametrised model matrices, damage can be quantified and localised 2.;Starting from the known linear elastic and lightly damped supporting struc ture the first step is the approximation as a finite element model. Thereby the model has to be validated with the real structure. It is advantageous to apply preexisting knowledge about structural area or parts, e.g. welded or bolted joints or the splash zone, which are prone to damage. For this purpose the portions of the model matrices  particularly of the stiffness matrix  associated with these details are parametrised. Herewith, the mathematical model characterising the dynamic behavior is given. On the other hand, the information about the current dynamic behavior of the potentially damaged structure is provided by the modal quantities. The modal quantities which are most exactly measurable are the eigenfrequencies. These can be mea sured by means of ambient excitation. The identification should provide the
