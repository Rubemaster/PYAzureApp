A briefly mentioned mathematicalnumerical model (10.2) has been applied to a realcase 3D ABLflow problem over a complex topography. Also the two different wallmodelling approaches have been presented and some numerical results have been shown for comparison indicating an acceptable agreement. All the results have been obtained using a simple algebraic turbulence model.;1. Sladek I., Kozel K., Janour Z., Gulkova E. On the Mathematical and Nu;1. Sladek I., Kozel K., Janour Z., Gulkova E.
