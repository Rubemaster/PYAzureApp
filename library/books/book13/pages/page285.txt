51.3.1 Linear Models. WAsP 8.1 (Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program) and WAsP Engineering 2.0;The linear model WAsP developed by Risoe allows simulating wind behaviour by obtaining the socalled geostrophic wind atlas regime taking into account the effects of terrain variation, surface roughness and nearby obstacles at a local mast. The model, as it occurs with other linear models, is limited to neutrallystable wind flows over low, smooth hills with attached flows 1,2.;The wind atlas offers the possibility to spatially extrapolate the wind statistics obtained at a certain meteorological mast to different hub heights at other locations. The program has been validated at different sites and widely used for assessing wind.;51.3.2 Non Linear Models. Fluent 6.2;The NavierStokes solver Fluent 6.2 is one of the worlds leading CFD com mercial packages widely validated for a huge variety of flows supporting differ ent mesh types. This nonlinearized solver permits to recognise detached flows and to obtain iteratively the velocity magnitude and its components, the sta tic pressure and the fields of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and turbulence dissipation rate through the K model. In this study, wind is considered a 3D incompressible steady flow in which Coriolis force and heat effects have been omitted so neutral state of the atmosphere is considered 4.;The comparison shown in Table 51.1 indicates that CFD extrapolates wind speed between masts more accurately in almost all cases giving an average absolute error of 1.75 significantly less than the others 5.67 for WAsP Eng and 5.41 for WAsP.
