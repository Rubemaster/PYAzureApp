28nominal power production(Cp  0.41), 46 efficiency range.;The optimization process described in the present study is based on a parametric DOERSM approach which implies a specific interfacing between Optimization and CFD tools. The physical efficiency of the model used can confirm a certain realism of the optimal shape design which is very close to NACA0025 profile. An improvement of the numerical simulation by a phaseaverage eddy simulation will accurate the physical model and thus the reliability of the optimization. Furthermore, this improved CFD method will be used to take into account of unsteady effects like dynamic stall and aerodynamical interac tion between blades. The next step of this study will consist in implementing other shape design technics like topological analysis and levelset method.
