Summary. An experimental study on unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of NACA0012 airfoils at angles of attack  from 0 to 80 and Reynolds number of 5103 was carried out in a low speed water tunnel, concerning the starting problems of a small wind turbine. The unsteady characteristics of lift together with PIV and laser sheet visualization results shows that the second maximum lift at   40 is induced by the large vortex developed from the amalgamation of the smaller vortices from the leading edge.;For a small wind turbine generator, the starting performance has a great influence on the power generating capacity. During the starting process, the blades usually operate at high angles of attack and low Reynolds numbers. The aerodynamic study on this region is essential for improving its starting performance 1. However, such study was seldom conducted before. Most of the researches concentrated on the problems at low angles of attack and high Reynolds numbers for aeronautics. The flow physics at high angle of attack and low Reynolds number is also hardly to study effectively due to its complexity and lack of theory and advanced test techniques. With the development of wind turbine generators, efforts have been made to address this problem 24, but there are still many problems urgently to be solved.;The experiment was conducted in the water tunnel LW2330 at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The test section is 0.3 m (width)  0.6 m (height)  2.0 m (length). The test velocity is 0.05 m s1. The NACA0012 airfoil with
