TLWs with embedded rotors and prevents a downslope shooting flow. The boundarylayer developed on the obstacle thus plays an important and fun damental role on the wave field dynamics, as was shown for other stratified flow configurations (e.g. 2,5,6).;The experiments consist in towing a Gaussianshaped quasi twodimensional obstacle in an upright configuration on the bottom of a hydraulic tank at constant velocity U0, yielding a uniform base flow. The tank is filled with linearly stratified salt water, characterized by a uniform frequency N of order 1 rad s1. (See 3 for more details.) All experiments are carried out at FH  0.6 where wave breaking occurs. The tank is seeded with particles to apply the particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) technique developed by Fincham and Spedding 7. The CCD camera and the vertical laser sheet, placed on the symmetry plane parallel to the flow, are fixed to the towing carriage. The no slip condition behind the obstacle is realized with a thin baseplate attached to the trailing edge of the obstacle. Two tanks, whose dimensions HtWtLt are 0.7  0.8  7 m3 and 1  3  22 m3, enable Re  U0H of order 102 and 104 to be reached, respectively.;Figure 18.1 shows the stationary ucomponent of the wave field over the ob stacle obtained by the PIV technique. (Two separated and overlapping PIV flowfields have been assembled.) We can clearly identify a wedge of stag nant fluid at high altitude corresponding to the wavebreaking region, below which the flow separates and forms a TLW train. Under both humps, negative velocities are observed, indicative of rotors. The separation occurs at half the wavelength   2U0N  3.8H which suggests that the flow separation is leewave induced. Given the uniform base N and U0, TLWs are not expected,;Fig. 18.1. uU0 velocity field and streamlines for wave breaking conditions. Re  102 and noslip condition is on the obstacle.
