In order to simulate dynamic loads on a wind turbine rotor it is necessary to simulate the turbulent inflow to the rotor realistically. In this paper we review various methods to do so. In many situations, for example for strong winds over flat terrain, turbulence may be considered for practical load calculation purposes not far from being Gaussian. In this situation it is enough to know the secondorder statistics, e.g. spectra and crossspectra, to be able to simulate. The secondorder statistics are either obtained from empirical onedimensional spectra and coherences as in the Sandia method, or from a semiempirical threedimensional spectral tensor as in the Mann model 4,5. These methods, which both appear in the third edition of the IEC standard 614001, will be compared.;The assumptions of the models stationarity, homogeneity, and gaussianity, can all be questioned, especially when the terrain is not simple or when turbines appear in wind farms. Here a variety of methods are possible and we will present a few practical examples of these. Particular emphasis will be put on constrained Gaussian simulation where extreme gusts can be embedded in a turbulent field. This method can also be used simulate entire fields based on measurements in a few points. Practical simulations of wake turbulence based on meandering will also be presented together with preliminary remote sensing measurements 2.;The basis of most practical models to simulate the inflow turbulence for aero elastic codes, such as HAWC and FLEX, is the second order statistics. It is true that real turbulence can not be gaussian. This can, for example, be seen from the famous relation
