The test setup 1  airfoil, 2  side plates, 3  airfoil supporters, 4  torque resisting system, 5  setup base, 6  connection pole, 7  force sensor system, 8  water tunnel, 9  cover plate, and 41  U shaped connectors, 42  circular plate, 43  pins around which the connectors can turn freelychord length of c  0.1 m is selected as the test model, and the test Reynolds number in terms of the airfoil chordlength is Re  5  103. The test angle of attack of the airfoil ranges from 0 to 80.;A 3component force sensor, 9251A, made by Kistler Company, was usedto measure the instantaneous lift and drag simultaneously. The test setup is shown in Fig. 38.1. The force sensor had to be positioned out of the test section due to its nonwater resistant. A unique torque resisting system, shown in Fig. 38.1c, was designed to successfully avoid the influence of any torque. Two sideplates are used to prevent 3D flow effects.;The typical power spectrum density (PSD) results of the lift at   20and 40 and the corresponding PIV results are presented in Fig. 38.2a,b, respectively, where  is the circulation  around the PIV view field divided by its area. The PSD results of lift will reflect its response to the flow field unsteady properties which are shown by the temporal changes of . From the comparison, following findings are summarized;1. At lower angles of attack,  10, there is no evident peak in the PSDcurve of lift except at f   1.2, the selfvibration frequency of model.;2. At   20, a peak appears at f   0.16 Hz in the PSD curve of;2. At   20, a peak appears at f   0.16 Hz in the PSD curve oflift measurements, and grows to its maximum with the angle of attack increasing to   40, when  nearly has the same primary frequency of f   0.18. Such synchronization implies that the second peak lift
