148 S. Jost et al.to destination node f is transmitted along the links of the shortesthop path ifhop. Out of all N(N  1) paths between the N nodes, the betweenness centrality;path(ifhop n)sif (26.1)counts all shortesthop paths which go over the picked node n and defines its load during normal network operation. The index function path(ifhop n) is equal to one if n belongs to the shortesthop path ifhop, and zero else.;In case of a heterogeneous network structure, a very heterogeneous loaddistribution emerges see Fig. 26.1. A few nodes have to carry an exceptionally large load. If some of them fail, it comes to a networkwide load redistribution. The shortest flow paths, which were going via the failed nodes, are readjusting and are using the other (transmission) nodes. As a consequence of this read justment, some nodes have to carry a larger load than before. If the new loads exceed their capacities, then the respective nodes will also fail, triggering a new load redistribution with possibly more overload failure.;In order to reduce the occurrence of such a cascading failure, an (N1)analysis is evoked. One of the N nodes, say m, is virtually removed from the network. The shortesthop flow paths of the reduced (N1) network are recalculated, which then according to (26.1) determine the readjusted loads Ln(m) of the remaining N1 nodes. This procedure is repeated for every;Fig. 26.1. Distribution of node loads Ln resulting from the hop metric (vertical crosses) and the loaddependent metric (rotated crosses). The two curves are aver aged over 50 independent random scalefree network realizations with parameters N  1000 and   3. A scalefree network is characterized by the degree distribu tion pk  k to find a node attached to k links. The load is given in units of the network size
