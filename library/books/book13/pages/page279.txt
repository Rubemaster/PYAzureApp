The feasibility of this concept is proved and the parametrical study about the porous disc shows how the different disc features control the velocity deficit. Playing with the porosity level, any velocity deficit could be reproduced. Play ing with the porous material homogeneity, one could reproduce even a non uniform velocity deficit, which is more realistic. These experiments show also that the physical modelling is a good alternative andor complement to the nu merical modelling. For fundamental studies, it can help to better understand the interactions between wind turbine wakes and wind farms, to quantify the impact of wind farms on the atmospheric boundary layer, to validate numer ical models and to develop the numerical porositydrag concept. For applied studies, real situations can be reproduced in wind tunnel. Even complex ter rain can be studied. The wind resource assessment for actual wind farms, as well as the wind farm impact on the site, can be performed.;1. Dupont S., Otte T.L., Ching J.K.S. (2004) Simulation of Meteorological Fields;1.
