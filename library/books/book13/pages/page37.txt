Summary. A concept for describing design waves for a nearshore site of a windpower plant and ultimately the wave loads is to transform the offcoast wave spectrum to the target site by a model for wave transformation. At the site second order, irregular, nonlinear, shallowwater waves are subsequently realized in the time domain. Alternatively a Boussinesq model is used. Finally in the examples here Morisons equation is used for the wave load and overturning moment.;Usually there is little knowledge of longterm wave conditions at prospective sites for windpower plants, while the deepwater or open sea conditions may be more known and geographically less varying. Then a concept for assessing design waves for the site and ultimately wave loads would be to transform the offcoast waves to the target nearcoast site or shallow offshore shoal by some model for the wave transformation. Such models can be divided into two general classes phaseresolving models, which model the progression of the physical wave train, predicting both amplitudes and phases of indi vidual waves, and phaseaveraging models, which model the progression of average quantities such as the wave spectrum or its integral properties (e.g. Hs, Tz). Here examples of using phase average models (WAM and SWAN) and a phase resolving model (Boussinesq) will be demonstrated. Using e.g. the phaseaveraging model SWAN for the transformation to the site, it is subsequently necessary to make a time realization of the transformed wave spectrum into the time domain as the loads on a slender structure is due to nonlinear drag forces, the instantaneous elevation of the water surface and  for high waves  the skewness of the elevation. For a phase resolving method the transformed wave is already in the time domain and can thus be used directly in the load modelling.
