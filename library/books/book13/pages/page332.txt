N. Cosack, S. Emeis and M. Kuhn;The variation of wind speed with height above ground is an important design parameter in wind energy engineering, as it influences power production and loading of the wind turbine. In a convective boundary layer we usually expect small vertical gradients of atmospheric variables like momentum or tempera ture. These unstable conditions are the normal case during daytime. At night, when the thermal production of turbulence vanishes and the mechanical pro duction of turbulence is small (low to moderate wind speeds), the surface layer can decouple from the rest of the boundary layer. Such stable conditions lead to strong vertical gradients of atmospheric variables at night. Especially we observe very low wind speeds near the ground and higher wind speeds above the surface layer. This high wind speed band above the surface layer is called LowLevelJet (LLJ). In addition to the change in wind speed, the wind direc tion in the various layers can also differ significantly. In the following sections we evaluate the influence of LLJs that have been measured in the northern part of Germany on wind turbines by means of computer simulation.;Since 1996, the Institute of Meteorology and Climatic Research of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe performed measurements of vertical wind pro files at various sites in Germany using Sodar. Details on the measurement cam paigns and their results have been presented in 1,2. From the vast amount of data, two typical profiles of change in wind speed with height have been chosen for the described analysis. Although the change in wind direction with height has a significant impact on loading and power, only results from profiles with constant wind direction will be shown here.
