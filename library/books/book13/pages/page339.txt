Fig. 62.3. Failure Frequency and downtimes of componentsa certain extent by short standstill periods. But still, damages of generators, gear boxes, and drive trains are of high relevance due to long downtimes of about 1 week as an average.;Wind turbines achieve an excellent technical availability of about 98 on average, although they have to face a high number of malfunctions. It can be assumed that these good availability figures can only be achieved by a high number of service teams who respond to turbine failures within short time. In order to further improve the reliability of WTs, the designers have to better the electric and electronic components. This is particularly true and absolutely necessary in the case of new and large turbines.
