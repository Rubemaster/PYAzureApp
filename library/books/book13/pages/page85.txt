(11.1)with height z, roughness length z0, MoninObukhov length L, friction velocity u, and von Karmans constant   0.4 and the empirical power law;(11.2)with reference height zA and Hellmann exponent n. Due to its mathematical simplicity (11.2) is widely used for wind energy purposes. The first part of this study (Chap. 11.2) investigates the possible approximation of (11.1) by (11.2), the second part (Chap. 11.3) compares (11.1) and (11.2) to measured offshore wind profiles.;In extension to existing studies (e.g. 2) the slope and the curvature of the logarithmic and the power law profiles should coincide in a selected height si multaneously in order to give a good fit over a wider height range. The surface roughness and thermal stratification conditions for which such a simultaneous coincidence is possible are calculated analytically (see the full equations in 3). It turns out that for neutral and unstable conditions slopes and curvatures of the two profiles (11.1) and (11.2) cannot coincide simultaneously. Only an approximate coincidence is found in the limit z0  0 for very smooth surfaces.
