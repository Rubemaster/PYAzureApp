Fig. 53.3. Overview of calculation processcomponents substructure, tower, nacelle and rotor are installed sequentially, very much in the same way as onshore construction is performed.;Due to the fact that conventional installation is not feasible as jackups for 45 m water depth are not available for economical conditions, an installation in two parts is foreseen. The OJQ will be installed and piled first and the full assembly of wind turbine, rotor and tubular tower will be installed as one complete unit subsequently. A detailed investigation on how and if this approach can be made to work is currently underway.;1. Schubert, M. Gowein, J. Aufstellung und erste Betriebserfahrungen;1. Schubert, M. Gowein, J.
