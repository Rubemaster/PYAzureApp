Equation (32.2) shows;denotes the variance of fluctuations. Equation (32.2) showsthat the real power curve Pr(V ) (as it would be realized in laminar wind flows) has to be modified. This modification is strong for large variance of fluctuations. For negative curvatures the real power curve is underestimated by P(u) while for positive curvatures it is overestimated.;Obviously (32.2) is only appropriate for small fluctuations, i.e., for small;Obviously (32.2) is only appropriate for small fluctuations, i.e., for smallturbulence intensities   V . In addition to that Pr(V ) is in general not known in advance 2.;We thus propose an alternative approach (based on the theory of Langevinprocesses) to determine the real power curve even for very noisy (turbulent) wind conditions. To this end a simple power curve model will be analyzed.;32.1.1 Reconstruction of a Synthetic Power Curve;A Langevin equation generally describes the temporal evolution of a state vector q(t)  (q1(t), q2(t), ..., qn(t)) and has the following form;A Langevin equation generally describes the temporal evolution of a state vector q(t)  (q1(t), q2(t), ..., qn(t)) and has the following formqi  D(1);j(t), (32.3)where D(1) denotes the deterministic drift coefficient, D(2) the stochastic diffusion coefficient 3, and (t) Gaussian distributed white noise (with i(t)j(t)  ij(t  t)). The coefficients are obtained via the conditional moments;ij (q, )  qi(t  )  qi(t)qj(t  )  qj(t) q(t)q (32.4)by first dividing them by  and then calculating the limit   0. For a good temporal resolution the relation between moments and coefficients can be approximated according to;ij (q, )    D(2)ij (q). (32.5)
