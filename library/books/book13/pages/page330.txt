This specified innovative construction for the foundation structure of OWEC builds the basis for all further investigations in the new research project, which is now continued by material testing. Structures with large wall thicknesses cause problems for the execution of the tests, so that simplified test specimens are investigated at first. In the second step, further tests on sections of the tripod joint are to be carried out. To determine the complex stress distribution in the tripod joint and to consider the surrounding conditions for the test setup, further comprehensive finiteelement analyses are performed, as is illustrated in Fig. 60.3. In parallel, practical parameter studies are supported by extensive numerical work.
