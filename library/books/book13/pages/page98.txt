Engineers 7. However this scale belongs to the inertial range it is usually not a characteristic time scale, so that the results obtained here are expected to be valid for any other scale  belonging to the inertial range. Here we consider the recurrent times of gust events the times between successive gust events. The recurrent times of meteorological events have practical importance, and correspond to the knowledge of some dynami cal properties of wind fluctuations. Here we not only focus on the mean return times, but also on their pdf. We consider the evolution of this pdf with increasing velocity thresholds . For illustration purposes, we have taken an atmospheric turbulent velocity data base velocity measurements taken 25 m from the ground in southwest France, with a sonic velocimeter sampling at 10 Hz (see 8, 9). We analyze here three portions of duration 55 min each, recorded under nearneutral stability conditions. A portion of the data is shown in Fig. 13.1 this illustrates the intermittent behavior of wind turbulence. The power spectrum of the 3 portions is shown in Fig. 13.2, in loglog plot, indicating a very nice 53 scaling law over most of the available dynamics (between 0.2s and about 10 min). We have then trans formed the velocity time series into an amplitude increment time series Y3(t)  V (t  0)  V (t) with 0  3s. The new time series is shown in Fig. 13.3, together with an example of threshold (  1 m 1), and the asso ciated recurrent times. Successive return time form a new time series which is represented in Fig. 13.4. An interesting question is now to evaluate the tail behavior of the pdf of return times since gust events are associated to large return times, their probability of occurrence is given by the tails. There are in fact many results providing the form of the tail of the pdf of recurrent times (also called firstpassage times) for scaling processes. One of the most classical scaling
