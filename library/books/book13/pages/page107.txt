The starting point for OWID is the measured undisturbed wind conditions at the FINO1 platform. For large offshore wind farms, wind conditions will be severely influenced by the wake fields of the wind turbines. This extra turbu lence may dominate the design conditions for certain situations. Therefore in a next step wind park effects will be simulated by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods 7,8. Both undisturbed and disturbed (park effect) wind conditions are taken as input for modelling a 5 MW wind turbine and study the effect on the layout. Together with an evaluation of life time effects this will be the basis for proposals to improve standard wind conditions in the guidelines.;1. T. Neumann, et al. DEWIMagazin Nr. 23, August 2003 2.
