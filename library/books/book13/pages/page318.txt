310 L. Lohaus and S. Anders;UHPC Univ. of Aalborg UHPC (heat treated) Univ. of Kassel;The advantage of calculating Youngs modulus instead of the deformationdevelopment is that a degradation formula can be derived and implemented into Finite Element Programs. Different approaches for the development of Youngs modulus for normal strength concrete without fibres have been proposed so far.;As stated for instance in the existing design rules for Grouted Joints 1, 2, specimens containing shear keys show an increasing ultimate load with an increasing shear key height. In the following static and fatigue tests on scaled down Grouted Joints specimens will be discussed. These specimens were projected to comply as far as possible with the regulations published by Det Norske Veritas. Further conditions were commercially available steel profiles as well as the present testing devices.;In the static tests, specimens without shear keys and specimens with shearkey heights of 0.3 and 1.25 mm were tested (Fig. 58.2 a).;It can be seen that the specimens containing shear keys show two nearlylinear parts in the loaddisplacement curves. From the results obtained so far it seems as if the failure at the end of the first part is caused by a failure at the lowest compression strut between the shear keys of the pile and the sleeve. This point is referred to as first maximum load. With the load further increasing, the concrete on the compression side of the shear keys starts to crush and
