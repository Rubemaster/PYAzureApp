304 J. Reetzinvestigated are, e.g. accuracy of eigenfrequencies, size of damaged area, stiffness reduction, location, number of damages, number of considered eigen frequencies. It turned out that the crucial parameter, which essentially influ ences the method, is the accuracy of the eigenfrequencies. A residual analysis determines the best fit for the simulated data, which is achieved by a linear proportionality function. The confidence interval is unchanged over the area of validity as well as the limit of quantification. Thus detection and quantification have the same sensitivity.;The next step of the validation of method is the confirmation of the results of the simulations on test structures. For this purpose scale test models will be established and tests will be carried out in the laboratory and under natural excitation. Before real application on wind turbines further tests on large structures with real or artificial damages are desirable.;2. Cottin N (2001) Dynamic model updatinga multiparameter eigenvalue problem.
