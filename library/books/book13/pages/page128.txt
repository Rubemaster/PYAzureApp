Downstream slipcondition influence. uU0 with slip condition (a), and noslip condition (b), yNF 1 H with slip condition (c), and noslip condition (d)but an estimation of two Scorer parameters 8, l2  gN;U , for the per turbed shear flow above the separation, divided into two constant llayers, is in agreement with the existence of TLWs. On the upstream slope of the obsta cle, stagnant fluid with a separated region reaching z  0.4H can be observed, while further upstream a blocked region of height  0.2H, characteristic of low Froude number flows, can be seen.;While the slip condition on the obstacle has been shown to play a major role on the flow dynamics 4, the boundarycondition immediately behind the obstacle is usually freeslip when the obstacles are towed in stationary fluid. Here we introduce a physically correct noslip condition in the lee of the obstacle itself, at low Renumber. The uU0 velocity and yNF 1 H vorticity fields are presented in Figs. 18.2a and c for the freeslip and in Figs. 18.2b and d for noslip case, respectively. Contrary to the onobstacle slipcondition, the downstreamoftheobstacle slip condition reveals no major influence. It was also observed that the time the waves need to become unstable, break and establish a stationary regime are equivalent in both cases. The leeside speed increases to 2.5U0 at x  1.2H. The reversed flow below the first crest, in dicative of a rotor, attains a 0.1U0 magnitude, in both cases, even though in Fig. 18.2b it is located just above the slip discontinuity. The vorticity sheets on the first wave crest in Figs. 18.2c and d are significantly higher than the underlying wave vorticity and originate in the boundary layer, clearly indi cating a boundarylayer separation that drives the rotor formation. There are
