Summary. Todays wind field simulation tools are based on Gaussian statistics and if they resolve the smallest scales they are not concerned about a consistent description of velocity and dissipation. We present a datadriven stochastic model that provides such a consistent description. The model is a multifractal extension of fractional Brownian motion, it also describes the nonGaussian statistics of turbulent wind fields. In order to further integrate skewness and stationarity an additional small correlation between the multifractal part and the fractional Brownian motion is added.;A sound understanding and modelling of smallscale turbulence in wind fields is  besides being an interesting and challenging problem in itself  important in many real world applications. For example, the design of modern wind energy converters requires a detailed modelling of the flow around the rotor blades. Moreover, with a better understanding of turbulent flow properties an ultrashort prognosis might become feasible which would be a beneficial contribution for an intelligent condition monitoring and controlling.;There are plenty of stochastic models that can reproduce selected statistical properties of a smallscale turbulent velocity field 3. All of these do not include proper features of the dissipation . Likewise good models for the dissipation exist 6, but it is not straightforward to translate dissipation into a velocity field. We will present a datadriven phenomenological model that provides a consistent description of the velocity as well as the dissipation field.
