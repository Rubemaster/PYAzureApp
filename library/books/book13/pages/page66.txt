J.C. Lopes da Costa, F.A. Castro and J.M. L.M. Palma;Because of the flow complexity and wind power reduction, the regions near or within forests have not been considered for wind park installation. However, because of the shortage of good clear sites, this situation was reverted, adding new motivation to the study of the wind flow over forested regions.;The socalled k   model, the standard in flow modelling of engineeringapplications, has also appeared in atmospheric flow studies, circumventing the limitations of simpler approaches 1. However, in the case of canopy flows, there are open questions on the actual performance of the k   compared with lower order models, and the mathematical form of the additional terms in the transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation  2.;The canopy models as in 4,6 and a version of k    v2  f 3 are studied over model forests. For sake of compactness, the model description will be restricted to their differences from the standard versions, i.e. without the terms accounting for the canopy. The reader may refer to the original publications for a complete description of each of the models being used here.;The presence of the canopy requires an additional term in the momentumequation accounting for the extra drag, and redefinition of the production terms of k and  in the transport equations, where additional terms Sk and S will appear (Pk    Sk) and (C1kPk  C22k  S). In case of kv2 f turbulence model, the equation for f contains also an additional Sk, Cf2(Pk  Sk)k.
