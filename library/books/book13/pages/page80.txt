The paper deals with a mathematical and numerical investigation of a 3Dflow in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over a complex topography situated around a Pragues agglomeration. The concept of a wall function is compared with a noslip wall modelling. The mathematical model is based on full RANS equations considered in the conservative form. A simple algebraic turbulence closure is performed together with a stationary boundary conditions.;F x  Gy  Hz  (K  R)x  (K  S)y  (K  T )z . (10.1);W t  F x  Gy  Hz  (K  R)x  (K  S)y  (K  T )z, (10.2)where W  (p2, u, v, w)T stands for the vector of unknown variables, namely the pressure and the three velocity components, respectively. The vectors F  (u, u2  p, uv, uw )T , G  (v, vu, v2  p, vw )T , H  (w, wu, wv, w2 p )T denote the inviscid fluxes and R  (0, ux, vx, wx )T , S  (0, uy, vy, wy )T and T  (0, uz, vz, wz )T represent the viscous ones. The density  is supposed to be constant and    abbreviates the arti ficial sound speed. Finally, the parameter K refers to the turbulent diffusion coefficient, see (10.3) in Sect. 10.1.1.
