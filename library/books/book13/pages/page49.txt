Even so, these comparisons are useful, for ex ample it can be seen from Fig. 3.5 that apparently the pitch controller in the calculations is more nervous than the actual pitch system.;How good the load prediction is, is measured with the fatigue damageequivalent load. In Table 3.1 some results are given. Each selected measured 10 min. period was reproduced 20 times, respectively without constraint, and with wind constrained in 1 and 3 points. Mean and standard deviation of calculated load ranges are normalized by the measured load range. There is some improvement here and there, but on the whole it is not convincing. From the lack of improvement it must be concluded that the fatigue loads are mainly determined by high frequency wind variation, while the constraints only fix the low frequency wind (as can be seen in Figs. 3.3 and 3.5). We stress that at present it cannot be established whether this conclusion has general validity, because the limited number of load cases that were investigated.;If the method of constrained wind is used in load verification, the low fre quency part of the wind and turbine loading can be reproduced well, which makes it possible to compare time traces directly. From the three load cases investigated here, it appeared that there was no improvement in predicted fa tigue damage equivalent load ranges. However, more work is needed to verify this conclusion.
