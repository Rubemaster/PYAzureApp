Assuming that cp is proportional to the wind speed u(zB), i.e. cp  B u(zB), the height of the wave boundary layer can be written as;Assuming that cp is proportional to the wind speed u(zB), i.e. cp  B u(zB), the height of the wave boundary layer can be written aszB  B2;f(2) where f is the Coriolis parameter,  theturbulent viscosity and u1  0.5 ugr and v1  0.5 vg.;At the interfaces between wave boundary layer and Ekman layer, z zB, the turbulent stress tensor and the turbulent viscosity is assumed to be continuous such that the wind profiles can be matched smoothly. This matching condition at the transition between wave boundary layer and Ekman layer provides the necessary link to calculate the parameter r. At z  zB the height dependent viscosity (zB)   u zB m of the wave boundary layer, where m is a MOparameter, and the constant viscosity   2;zB, the turbulent stress tensor and the turbulent viscosity is assumed to be continuous such that the wind profiles can be matched smoothly. This matching condition at the transition between wave boundary layer and Ekman layer provides the necessary link to calculate the parameter r. At z  zB the height dependent viscosity (zB)   u zB m of the wave boundary layer, where m is a MOparameter, and the constant viscosity   2f (r  1)2 KI u2;of the Ekman layer are set equal, (zB)  . Using (5.2) and (5.3) this provides the defining equation for r;The parameters KI  1.5  103 and B  1.3 were obtained from independent oceanographic measurements 2, f and g are known constants at the desired location. m has to be given or set to 1 for neutral conditions. The geostrophic wind G as driving force can be chosen to match a given wind speed at a given height. Hence, (5.5) can be iteratively solved for r and the vertical wind profiles according to (5.1) and (5.4) can be calculated.
