S.E. Larsen, S.E. Gryning, N.O. Jensen, H.E. Jrgensen and J. Mann;Summary. Most wind energy related boundary layer formulations derive from the atmospheric surface boundary layer. The increasing height of modern wind turbines forces meteorologists to use relations more appropriate for greater heights. Such expressions are not as well established as the surface layer formulations. Data from the new Danish wind energy test site at Hvsre is used to illustrate similarities and differences.;, (4.1)where u is the friction velocity, z the measuring height and z0 the roughness length,  the v. Karman constant,  the stability function and L is the length scale of thermal stratification;gz T , (4.2)with T and  being temperature and potential temperature respectively. Neu tral conditions correspond to (zL  0)  0, i.e. when z is small and or L is large. Conversely for z large, L has to be even larger to ensure that the atmosphere can be considered neutral. For zL  0.5 one will expect the stability term in (4.1) to be important. The scales, u and w, reflect the stress and heatflux conditions at the surface.
