Figure 57.2a shows that larger heat fluxes have to be supplied to the wider cord rotor (the singlebladed one) since the heated area lies close to the lead ing edge. However, the antiicing power requirement Qt (Fig. 57.2b), which depends on the number of blades, decreases considerably from the threeto the singlebladed turbine, in a manner that is nearly proportional to the num ber of blades. Figure 57.2c shows that the reduction of the number of blades reduces the ratio of rotor antiicing thermal power to rated turbine power.
