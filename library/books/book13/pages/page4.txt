Wind energy is one of the prominent renewable energy sources on earth. During the last decade there has been a tremendous growth, both in size and power of wind energy converters (WECs). The global installed power has increased from 7.5 GW in 1997 to more than 50 GW in 2005 (WWEA  March 2005). At the same time, turbines have grown from kW machines to 5 MW turbines with rotor diameters of more than 100 m. This enormous develop ment and the more recent use in offshore application made high demands on design, construction and operation of WECs. Thus not only a new major in dustry has been established but also a new interdisciplinary field of research affecting scientists from engineering, physics and meteorology.;In order to tackle the problems and reservations in this interdisciplinary community of wind energy scientists, ForWind, the Center for Wind Energy Research of the Universities of Oldenburg and Hanover, arranged the EUROMECH Colloquium 464b  Wind Energy, which was held from October 4, 7, 2005, at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany. The central aim of this colloquium was to bring together the up to then separate communities of wind energy scientists and those who do fundamental research in mechanics. Wind energy is a challenging task in mechanics and many of future progress will find relevant applications in wind energy conversion.
