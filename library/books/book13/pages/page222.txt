Fig. 37.2. Drag and lift coefficients at rR  65.7;Fig. 37.3. Drag and lift coefficients at rR  94.7;Fig. 37.3. Drag and lift coefficients at rR  94.7and compared to 2D airfoil characteristics from 1 and the results of AT 2. Excellent agreement is seen in the linear region up to   12. For big AOA ( 15), 2D airfoil data fails due to the Coriolis and centrifugal forces present in the boundary layer of a rotating blade. Next we consider the position closer to the blade tip at r  94.7R. The drag and lift coefficients are plotted in Fig. 37.3. Since the position is very close to the tip, a tip correction using Prandtls tip loss function for AT is also plotted. From the figure, we can see that the present result agrees well with the AT without tip correction. On the other hand, the introduction of a tip correction gives the curve closer to the 2D characteristics.;As a summary, the drag and lift coefficients in different radial positions areplotted in Fig. 37.4. From the figure, we can see that drag coefficient increases when the radial position is close to the rotor center whereas lift coefficient remains the same but with a small stall region.
