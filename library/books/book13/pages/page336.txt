With the rapid expansion of wind energy use in Germany over the past 15 years, extensive developments in wind turbine (WT) technology have taken place. The new technology has achieved such a level of quality, that WTs obtain a technical availability of 98.;This means that an average WT will be inactive for around 1 week per yearfor repairs and maintenance. Considering that the WTs operate over years without operating personnel, this average downtime seems short. The paper gives some figures about reliability of wind turbines, failures and downtimes for wind turbines and components.;In the framework of the 250 MW Wind Programme, ISET is monitoring over 1,500 WTs in operation. Over a period of 15 years now, WTs with a variety of different technical conceptions and installed in different regions in Germany have been included in the programme. So, from these turbines, the experiences of up to 15 operating years are readily available. On average, the participating turbines have completed 10 years of operation.;Operators of the supported WTs regularly report to ISET concerningenergy yields, maintenance and repairs, and operating costs. In form sheets for maintenance and repair, the operators report on the downtimes caused by malfunctions, the damaged components and  as far as possible  the causes and obvious effects on turbines and operation.;Most of these supported WTs have a rated power below 1 MW. Thus, inthe recent years operators of megawatt WTs where asked quite successfully to contribute to the programme on a voluntary basis. So, experiences of the recent models can be included into the evaluations as well.
