One of the main drivers for an economic installation is the substructure design. Many developments on substructure concepts are ongoing and the industry is clearly moving towards more competitive concepts. REpower has worked ex tensively on design methods for the combined wind and wave loading and sev eral substructures have been evaluated from technical and economical points of view.; Stiffness representation with a Monopile is not adequate for all kinds of substructures. This leads to significant differences in overall stiffness and thus eigenfrequencies, which are an important parameter in the transient calculations.  Wave loading is calculated for a straight vertical member, so that the positive effect of distributed members in wave direction is not taken into
