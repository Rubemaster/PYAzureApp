Incident flows on wind turbines are often highly turbulent because they oper ate in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and sometimes in the wake of other wind turbines. In the ABL, the turbulence level varies from 5 (offshore) to 40 and length scale varies typically from 0.001 to 500 m or more 1. The blade aerodynamics is greatly influenced by rotation 2. The flow on wind turbine blade being often separated due to the angle of attack encountered which depends on turbulence level, tower shadow or yaw misalignement. The present study is focused on the coupled influence of turbulence and rota tion on the separation on the blade airfoil. After presenting the experimental setup, the separation on the blade is studied from average pressure distri butions. The high turbulence levels lead to an important measurement dis persion. This is the reason why, in a second part, the instantaneous pressure distributions are analysed.;The wind turbine, tested in the laboratory wind tunnel, was positioned in a 4 m x 4 m section, 1 m downwind of a square 3 m x 3 m nozzle generating a free open jet (Fig. 40.1). An isotropic and homogeneous turbulence, with integral length scale of the order of magnitude of the chord length and three different streamwise intensities (4.4, 9 and 12) was generated using a square grid mounted in the wind tunnel nozzle (Fig. 40.1). The wind turbine rotor diameter is 1.34 m, the blades have no twist, a NACA 654421 airfoil, and a 71 mm chord length. Surface pressure data have been obtained with one blade section equipped with 26 pressure taps at three radial positions from the hub  r;R  0.26, 0.51 and 0.75. Pressure were measured simultaneously on;R  0.26, 0.51 and 0.75. Pressure were measured simultaneously onthe 26 taps at a frequency of 200 Hz during 10.25 s.
