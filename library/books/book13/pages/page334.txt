The effect of this scenario is shown in Fig. 61.2. It can be seen, that thepresence of a LLJ leads to much higher differences then in the previously examined situation. The difference in power output in the case of the 5MW turbine with 130 m hub height is almost 30, while the difference in the blade bending moments standard deviation is up to 25. The general tendencies that have been observed before remain unchanged the relative differences are higher for the 5 MW turbine and for profile A.;Regarding the influence of LLJ on life time calculations, it has to be considered that lifetime fatigue loading and annual energy yield depend directly on the sitespecific frequency of occurrence and severity of such events. There fore their impact is hard to estimate but will probably be small. This is mainly due to the fact that at least at the measurement sites, these situations did
