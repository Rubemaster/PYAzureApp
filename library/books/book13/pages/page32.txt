2 B. Langepoint of view. The paper is structured in three main sections First some particular problems of offshore measurements are discussed in Sect. 1.2. This is followed by a section giving examples for meteorological effects specific for offshore conditions. Their importance for wind power application is shown in Sect. 1.4, followed by the conclusion.;In recent years, measurements with the aim to determine the wind conditions for offshore wind power utilization have been erected at a number of locations (Barthelmie et al., 2004). Offshore wind measurements are a challenging task, not only since an offshore foundation and support structure for the mast are needed, but also because of the challenges to provide an autonomous power supply and data transfer, the difficulties of maintenance and repair in an offshore environment, etc. These difficulties lead to high costs of offshore measurements and often lower data availability compared to locations on land. Additionally, the flow distortion of the self supporting mast usually requires a correction of the measured wind speeds for wind profile measurements (Lange, 2004). Two measurements, from which results are shown in this paper, are the Rdsand field measurement in the Danish Balitc Sea and the FINO 1 measure ment in the German Bight. The FINO 1 measurement platform (Rakebrandt Graner and Neumann, 2003) is located 45 km north of the island Borkum in the North Sea (see Fig. 1.1). The height of the measurement mast is 100 m. The field measurement program Rdsand (Lange et al., 2001) is situated about 11 km south of the island Lolland in Denmark (see Fig. 1.1) and includes a 50 m high meteorological mast.;There are fundamental differences between the wind conditions over land and offshore due to the influence of the surface on the flow. The most obvious one is the roughness of the sea, which is very low, but also changes due to the changing wave field (Lange et al., 2004b). The momentum transfer between
