Summary. Comparison of the performance characteristics of windrotors with rigidly fixed blades (Dariieu type), and similar windrotors with the control mecha nism of blades on the path of their motion, obtained from experimental researches of their models in a hydrotray has shown that the latter possesses the following advantage (a) lower speed of selfstart (b) increase in operating ratio of the flow energy (on 2070) and coefficient of rotor torque twice (c) decrease in some times quantity of full hydrodynamic drag of windrotor models.;Wind is an inexhaustible energy source on Earth. A known converter of wind flow energy into mechanical energy of rotation are windrotors with vertical axis of revolution (Darrieu rotor type). The advantages of wind turbines with such a rotor are independence of their functioning of wind flow direction, tran sition from console fastening of the windrotor axis to twobasic fastening, a possibility to mount an energy consumer in the basis of windplant, simplifi cation of blades design and their fastenings, decrease in aerodynamic noise, etc. One of the main disadvantage of such windrotors is the high velocity of wind flow at which the rotor selfstarts rotation. As a result, designers are compelled to supply such wind rotors with additional devices (the electric motor, Savonius rotor, etc.) to spinup the rotor and put it in operating conditions.;The high speed of selfstart of a windrotor, if its vertical blades are fixedon horizontal crosspieces rigidly, is caused by the feature that under static condition a wind flow cannot create sufficient torque to spinup the rotor. If there is a possibility to turn blades of motionless rotor so that the magnitude and direction of aerodynamic force is changed, there will be a possibility that the rotor selfstarts even at small wind speed.
