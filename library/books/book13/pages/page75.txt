Summary. The aim of the paper is to discuss the relations between the complex velocity field around the bluffbodies arrangement and the polluted gas concen tration in that area. The main attention has been put on the role of oscillating component of velocity as a factor stimulating the pollutant diffusion process. The analysis has been performed for the 2D case of two sharpedged bluffbodies in tan dem arrangement for which the strong level of oscillating component was available as the result of synchronization processes occurring in the flow surrounding the bodies. The mean concentration profiles of tracer gas (CO2) for various interobstacle gap were measured in wind tunnel flow. The local characteristics of flow were obtained by the use of commercial CFD code (FLUENT). The discussion is partially based on the results of the previous data contained in works of Jarza  Gnatowska 1,2, which revealed different flow regimes and critical body spacing at which dynamic properties of vortex structures around bluffbodies system alter rapidly reflecting the stability mode change.;The dispersion of pollutants in space around wind engineering structures, gov erned by convection and diffusion mechanism, depends strongly on the velocity field. To understand the phenomena related to the forming of concentration fields it is necessary to recognize the local features of the flow around the objects with the special emphasize for the mean velocity direction, random fluctuations, and periodical oscillations accompanying the vortex generation in bodies neighbourhood. The specific flow conditions generated around bluff bodies arrangement make it possible to study the gas pollutant dispersion for the case of very complex velocity field typical for built environment. Curved streamlines, sharp velocity discontinuities, high level flow oscillations and non homogenous turbulence disperse effluents in a complicated manner related to source configuration and object geometry.
