This figure shows a horizontal crosssection of a passive scalar FIF model with varying localization using gv(R)  gv,wav (Hwav)  g(Htur) v,tur (R) and Hwav  Htur  H  13, Ht  23 C1  0.1,   1.8 with a small amount of differential anisotropy (using a G with small offdiagonal components). Clock wise from the upper left we have Hwav  0, 0.33, 0.52, 0.38. Rendering is with single scattering radiative transfer. The forcing flux (  3212) is the same in all cases so that one can see how structures become progressively more and more wavelike. Since we simplify by modeling  directly, the statistics are the same as for a horizontal component of the wind field.
