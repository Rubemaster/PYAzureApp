Fig. 15.2. uturbulence simulation of velocity jump based on the spectral tensor by Mann. Shown in gray scale is u in the rotor plane at several several times. The velocity u at the centreline where the constraints are made, is also shown on the front of the box. Its maximum is around 5 m s1 and minimum 5 m s1 as seen from the scale on the front right edge of the box;15.4.2 Scanning Laser Doppler Wake Measurements;To test under which conditions, if any, the wake deficit can be considered as a passively advected quantity we are currently doing an experiment on a small Tellus turbine, with a rotor diameter of 20 m. A wind lidar 9 has been modified to be able to scan the wake downstream of the turbine by mounting it on the rear side of the nacelle. The instrument can remotely measure the component of the wind speed along the laser beam up to a distance of 200 m. By mounting the laser head (see Fig. 15.4) on a movable platform we can make horizontal cuts through the wake deficit. An example of this is seen in Fig. 15.5. At each downwind distance the lidar scans four times. At the closest distance the wake seems to cover almost the scanning angle. At the other distances the wake appears to the left. As we scan further downstream the wake deficit seems to widen and lessen in amplitude. Scanning at each downstream distance takes of the order of 4 s.;Fig. 15.3.
