The 2D simulation worked well under stationary inflow. As the boundary con ditions were set to periodic changes of the inflow boundaries, some difficulties were encountered. Obviously the calculation process in Nektar is working for the velocity flows (see Fig. 44.4 left). Therefore the general process of solv ing the problems seems to be working well. Nevertheless the pressure output shows relatively high pressure variations (Fig. 44.4 right). As the force on the profile seems to be in the same order as for the stationary calculation, the general calculation is obviously correct. These results are in need of further verification.;In a first step the pressure calculation for the time variable boundary condi tion has to be improved. Especially for simulating variable inflow it seems to be reasonable to implement a new way to establish time variable boundary conditions into the code. Since so far the time variability is limited to con tinuous functions, it seems convenient to create a more flexible code for time variable inflow. As so far only the 2DDNS code has been tested, all the further extension have to be implemented in the 3D and FourierLES code. As DNS is slow, simulation has been done so far for low Reynolds numbers only.;1. Amandolese, X., Szechenyi, E.
