The solid curve shows the turbulence corrected value, while the dotted curve shows the data binned in different turbulence intensity intervals. The corrected and the binned data coincide well up to about 12 turbulence intensity. At higher turbulence intensities the binned data deviate from the correction curve. The reason for the deviations is the fact that turbulence fluctuations of the wind speed cover a range down to cutin wind speed.;The presented method for correction has been successfully tested on different types of WTs. However, data sets with only marginal variation of turbu lence cause problems. The wider the turbulence range within the bins the more reliable the curve fit. As a main advantage of the proposed method it would be possible to transfer measured power curves from one specific site to another with a different turbulence distribution. Furthermore besides standar dising power curves with respect to air density a standardisation in relation to turbulence intensity can be introduced.;2. T.F. Pedersen, S. Gjerding, P. Ingham, P.
