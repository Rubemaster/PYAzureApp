The horizontal turbulence intensity profiles were measured by a mast sitedin the wake of a wind turbine. Depending on the incoming wind direction, one section of the wake could be measured. For the average periods (normally 10 min), the mean wind directions is used to estimate the measured part of the wake. Binaveraging is used to get a stationary turbulence intensity profile.;10.5 m s1. The ambient turbulence intensity was measured at the free stand ing meteorological mast for each direction bin. It is used direction depending for the model (mean value  5.8).;As can be seen in Figs. 47.2a,b the modelled data agree well the measuredturbulence intensity profiles. Both the maximum turbulence intensity and the profile shape are modelled accurately. The shape of the measured turbulence profiles for double and quintuple wake situation are nearly symmetric, this results from a nearly uniform turbulence intensity over the wind direction due to the homogenous roughness of the surrounding water surface.;Horizontal turbulence intensity profiles are compared. The calculated profiles agree very well with the measurements. Both the maximum values and the nearly symmetrical shapes of the measured profiles were modelled accurately.
