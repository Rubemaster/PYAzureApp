Fig. 57.2. Specific antiicing power requirement (a), total antiicing power require ment (b), and antiicingpower to ratedpower (c) for the two extreme angles of attacka running wet condition, require an antiicing power at the leading edge region increasing with the size and ranging between 10 and 15 of the turbines rated power output. This ratio is lower for larger size turbines compared to small ones. The antiicing power decreases more or less proportionally to the number of blades for turbines having the same solidity and size. The same conclusions, not shown here can be drawn for rotors of different solidity, although other physical mechanisms are involved. It is worth to mention that the above results concern the heat flux requirement and no considerations were developed at this stage on the adopted ice prevention system technology. The transfer of the results for their design must be carefully evaluated as the efficiency of the ice prevention system plays a basic role in defining the actual power requirement.;1. W.B.
