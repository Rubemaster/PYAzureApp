They are found from the auto power spectral densities and the (root) coher ence function .;In order to generate a spatial wind field we have to factorize the Sk matrixfor each frequency component. In case the wind is measured at some location, it is straightforward to determine the set of Fourier coefficients for that space point. We can now improve the simulation of the wind speeds at the other space points on basis of the knowledge of the wind speed at that point. The accompanying equations can be found in the appendix of 1. The wind fields which are simulated on basis of measured wind fields are called constrained stochastic simulations (they are generated under the constraint that at one or more points the measured wind speeds have to be reproduced). The generated wind fields may be considered to be wind fields which could have occurred during the measuring period the actual wind field can never be reproduced in case of just a few measurement locations, since turbulence is a stochastic process.;With the method given in Sect. 3.2 several sets of wind time series are generated. As turbulence model the Kaimal spectrum and coherence function of IEC 614001 are chosen. Wind fields are created with mean wind speeds below, around and above rated wind speed of the reference turbines. Turbu lence intensity is taken according to the IEC standard. For each situation at least 20 wind fields have been generated of 10 min length and a time step of 0.04 s. Nowadays it is common to generate all three velocity components since the measurements (see Sect. 3.5) involved the longitudinal component only, the constrained simulations are restricted to that component.
