The influence of the terrain was investigated by calculating correlations for each valid sector of 10, rather than using only one general correlation. Be tween the sectors, significant differences were found (Fig. 8.1). Two power curves were calculated using the correlations by sectors, or by taking the gen eral correlation. Once again, significative differences were observed, varying between 10 and 10 (Fig. 8.2). However, in terms of the annual energy pro duction (AEP), the variations were reduced to 0.65. This is explained by a compensatory effect due to the fact that certain variations are positive and other negative. Overall, the use of a general correlation does not generate ma jor errors over a long period, although involving significant differences between specific sectors.;The correlation is largely influenced by the cylindrical section near the root of the blade, and much less by the airfoils located at larger rR. A common hypothesis is to use a cylinder drag coefficient Cd  1.2. In reality, the Cd is function of the Reynolds number, and has to be calculated. Also, another correction has to be applied because of the finite length of the cylinder 3. Another conclusion is that one of the major factor influencing the correlation comes from the acceleration of the flow produced by the attachment unit of the anemometer, as shown in Fig. 8.3a.;A Ubeam has been added in the numerical simulation. The exact locationand caracteristics of the fixation systems are not know precisely. Thus, two
