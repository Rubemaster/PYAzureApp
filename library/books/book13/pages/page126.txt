Summary We present a laboratory investigation of the boundarylayer effects on mountain wavebreaking under conditions of uniform flow and stratifica tion, in particular the first complete up and downstream velocity field reveal ing upstream separation and blocking, wave breaking, downslope windstorms, trapped leewaves and rotors. Contrary to the slip condition on the obstacle we show that the slip condition downstream only has a slight influence on the flow dynamics. The results also reveal that the boundary layer developed on the obstacle is controlled by the wavefield, independently of the Reynolds number.;Flow of stably densitystratified fluid over orography, such as mountains, gen erates internal gravity waves. For strong enough stratifications, i.e. Froude;Flow of stably densitystratified fluid over orography, such as mountains, gen erates internal gravity waves. For strong enough stratifications, i.e. Froudenumbers FH  U0NH  1 where U0 is the wind speed, N ; z isthe BruntVaisala frequency and H the mountain height, these waves can attain sufficient amplitude to develop vertical isopycnals which leads to wave breaking at high altitudes. The ensuing (clearair) turbulence is accompanied by strong downslope windstorms, with speeds up to 50 m s1, as observed in Colorado on 11 January 1972 1.;Other orographic phenomena that can occur under stratified conditionsare trapped leewaves (TLW) with embedded rotors. These have usually been associated with inversions and nonuniform flow (e.g. 2) and are not usually linked to wavebreaking in uniform flow and stratification conditions. How ever, even for uniform conditions, these phenomena were observed by Eiff et Bonneton 3 when wave breaking occurs. Gheusi et al. 4 showed that the physically correct noslip condition on the obstacle yields TLWs and ro tors even for uniform conditions. In addition to showing that the maximum downslope wind speed is reduced (32.5U0), the slipcondition helps to induce
