H. Th. Beier, J. Lange and M. Vormwald;A methodology to obtain Wohlercurves is outlined in the present paper by applying it to truss joints with precut gusset plates (PCGPjoint), Fig. 52.1. The approach itself is supposed to be generally applicable to new construc tional details, of which the fatigue performance is certainly not yet classified.;An easier way to calculate the fatigue resistance of an unclassified structureis the use of the local stress approach. The local stress approach is exemplarily applied to discover the fatigue resistance of a critical detail of the GROe WIndkraft ANlage (great wind energy converter) GROWIAN, Fig. 52.2.;A way to reduce the number of tests for deriving a Wohlercurve is the additional use of appropriate and well established calculational models. If the calculation matches the test results, a number of further tests as far as parameter studies are concerned can then be done virtually by computing the fatigue resistance.;The proposed calculational concept takes into account all the three stagesof fatigue life, fatigue crack initiation, crack growth and fracture separately. The amount of input data is small and the data can be found in the literature. The concept is in principle not limited to a certain group of structural details. It is evaluated for metallic materials.;The calculation of the fatigue endurance limit for welded structurescan even be done by using the local stress approach and subsequently adding the Wohlercurve with a Wohlercurve exponent for welded structures, m  3. The method does not take into account the three mentioned stages separately.
