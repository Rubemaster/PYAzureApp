12 L. Bergdahl et al.x m;Using a phase resolving model like a Boussinesq model the surface elevation is already in the time domain. In Fig. 2.5 snapshots of a shoaling waves pass ing circular towers are shown. These simulations are made by an arbitrary highorder finiteelement method developed in 8. The wave kinematics has, however, to be reconstructed from the used Boussinesq assumption. However, for the most frequently used enhanced Boussinesq models the wave kinematics is poor. The force on the circular tower can be computed by direct integration of the pressure on the submerged part of the structure. It may be better to couple the enhanced Boussinesq model to a local ReynoldsAverage Navier Stokes (RANS) 9 model adjacent to the structure, taking the full viscous and freesurface characteristics of the problem into account.;It has been shown that for the purpose of assessing wave loads on wind power plants in shallow or near shore sites in the Baltic, one can establish deepsea wave climate by the Baltic WAM model, and transfer these waves by the phase averaging wave model SWAN to the more precise position of the plant. At this position nonlinear wave kinematics can be realized in the timedomain by a second order realization and finally the wave loading be calculated by integrating Morisons equation to the instantaneous free surface. Alternatively the realized kinematics can be fed into a timedomain model e.g. an enhanced Boussinesq model or even a local RANS model.
