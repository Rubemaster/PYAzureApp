78 Francois G. Schmittthresholds, confirming some previously observed results 14. As already no ticed in 13 in the context of rainfall, such tail behavior indicates that mean return times would theoretically diverge in the limit of an infinite number of realizations (since   2) the estimated mean return time depends in fact on the number of realizations taken for the statistics. Let us note also that the largest gusts correspond to a dimension ds close to 0, and thus a pdf of tail close to 1 this is confirmed in Fig. 13.5, for the largest threshold of 2 m s1 a straight line of slope 1 is shown for comparison. Return times for such extreme gusts correspond to sporadic processes, whose probability density is not normalizable (  p(t)dt diverges) 15,16.;We consider here another dynamical property of wind velocity fluctuations, that could also be interesting in the framework of wind energy applica tions the inverse times, i.e., successive first times necessary to observe a given velocity difference. This has been called inverted structure func tions by Jensen 17 who introduced the idea, and is now known as inverse structure functions 1820. This name is justified by the fact that usual structure functions correspond to wind velocity increments statistics for given time increments inverse structure functions correspond to time statistics for given velocity increments. Practically, these inverse times may be estimated the following way if ti is the time associated to a given inverse time, the next inverse time is Ti  ti1  ti with ti1  min (t  ti V (t)  V (ti)  );Fig. 13.6. Mean inverse times, estimated for various velocity thresholds. A straight line of slope 2.2 is shown for comparison
