E. Anahua, S. Barth and J. Peinke;Summary. We investigate how the power curve of a wind turbine is affected by turbulent wind fields. The electrical power output can be separated into two parts namely the relaxation part which describes the dynamic response of the wind turbine on sudden changes in wind velocity and a noise part. We have shown that those two parts describe the powercurve properly if they are calculated from stationary wind measurements. This analysis is very usefull to describe power curve characteristic for situation with increased turbulent intensities and it can be easily applied to measured data.;A standard procedure (IEC 6140012) to characterise the energy production of a wind electro converter (WEC) is to measure average values of elect. power output and longitudinal wind velocity at the hub hight simultaneously. From those measurements a power curve is obtained by u  L(u) as shown in Fig. 31.1 (the brackets denote the ensemble averages). This procedure is limited due to (1) nonlinearity of the power curve and (2) relaxation time which describes the dynamic response of the WEC on sudden changes of wind velocity. Such effects lead to the following inequality L(u)  L(u). To include those effects into the stationary power curve one could use a Taylor expansion of secondorder which is expressed by
