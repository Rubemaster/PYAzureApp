Ice accretion on wind turbine components affects system safe operation and performance, with an annual power loss up to 2050 at harsh sites. There fore, special design requirements, as ice prevention systems, are necessary for wind turbines to operate in cold climates. The paper presents results for evaluating the antiicing energy requirement for wind turbine blades as a function of wind turbine size and type. The analysis was carried out by means of the TREWICE R  code tool.;Although relatively numerous aeronautical ice accretionprediction codes have been developed , only a few dedicated codes exist for the analysis of ice accretion and the ice prevention systems design for wind turbines. Among them, the LEWICE 2.0 NASA code 1, adapted to predict antiicing power requirements for wind turbines and the TURBICE code 2 that simulates ice accretion on wind turbine blades (VTT). In the few papers appeared these codes have been used to predict ice accretion of a single wind turbines blade section and to asses the main heat and mass flux contributions. When develop ment and design of ice prevention systems is of concern, a lack of analysis and knowledge has been recognized by the authors of the paper on the following matters
