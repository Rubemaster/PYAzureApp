The IM research work is aimed to get together the diversity of different processes and process interactions which have to be taken into account for the analysis of an offshore wind turbine and its associated subsystems. There fore, a flexible structure of the IM is the main target of current research. A well designed objectoriented and easily extendable set of models and inter faces have to be developed in order to fulfill future demands. The current approach is depicted in Fig. 59.3.;The current status of development of the IM allows to define the geometric data, its discretization and the belonging material properties for the trans formation to the load module (WeveLoads) followed by the specification of input files for a dynamic analysis using a finite element solver. Thus, the user is assisted in three ways the geometric and material data transformation on the one hand and the transformation (globallocal) of the loading data or evaluation of resulting values on the one hand. With increasing amount of integrated submodules the usefulness of having graphical modules available in the IM gets more apparent as well as the need of data format transition.
