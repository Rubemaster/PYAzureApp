Summary. We presents an asymptotic expression for the distribution of the largest excursion from the mean level, during an arbitrary recurrence period, based on a mother distribution that reflects the exponentiallike distribution behaviour of large wind speed excursions. This is achieved on the expense of an acceptable distribution fit in the data population regime of small to medium excursions which, however, for an extreme investigation is unimportant. The derived asymptotic distri bution is shown to equal a Gumbel EV1 type distribution, and the two distribution parameters are expressed as simple functions of the basic parameters characterizing the stochastic wind speed process in the atmospheric boundary layer.;The statistical distribution of extreme wind speed excursions above a mean level, for a specified recurrence period, is of crucial importance in relation to design of wind sensitive structures. This is particularly true for wind turbine structures.;Cartwright and LonguetHiggens 1 derived an asymptotic expression for the distribution of the largest excursion from the mean level during an arbi trary recurrence period. From its inception, this celebrated expression has been widely used in wind engineering (as well as in offshore engineering)  often through definition of the peak factor, which equates the mean of the CartwrightLonguetHiggens asymptotic distribution.;However, investigations of full scale wind speed time series, recorded inthe atmospheric boundary layer, has revealed that the Gaussian assumption is inadequate for wind speed events associated with large excursions from the mean 24. Such extreme turbulence excursions seem to occur significantly more frequent than predicted according to the Gaussian assumption, which may underpredict the probability of large turbulence excursions by more than one decade.
