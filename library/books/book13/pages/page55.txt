J. Tambke, J.A.T. Bye, B. Lange and J.O. Wolff;To achieve reliable wind resource assessments, to calculate loads and wakes as well as for precise shortterm wind power forecasts, the vertical wind profile above the sea has to be modelled for tip heights up to 160 m. In previous works, we analysed marine wind speed profiles that were measured at the two met masts Horns Rev (62 m high) and FINO1 (103 m) in the North Sea (e.g. 3). It was shown that the wind shear above 50 m height is significantly higher than expected with MoninObukhov corrected logarithmic profiles, revealing an almost linear increase of the wind speed. For that reason, we developed a new analytic model of marine wind velocity profiles, which is based on inertial coupling between the Ekman layers of the atmosphere and the ocean. The good agreement between our theoretical profiles and observa tions at Horns Rev and FINO1 support the basic assumption in our model that the atmospheric Ekman layer begins at 15 to 30 m height above the sea surface.;The geostrophic wind is regarded as the driving force of the wind field in lower layers of the atmosphere. The momentum is transferred downwards through the Ekman layers of atmosphere and ocean, which are modelled with a constant turbulent viscosity. The challenge is to derive an adequate description of the coupling between the two Ekman layers, where the idea is to introduce a connecting wave boundary layer with a logarithmic wind profile that reaches only up to a maximal height of 30 m.
