Summary. For the turbine design and optimization of wind farm layouts with regard to increased loads the turbulence intensity incident on the wind turbines inside wind farms is needed. Here we present a semiempirical approach for calculat ing these turbulence intensities. The approach was compared to horizontal multiple wake turbulence intensity profiles from the Vindeby offshore wind farm.;The turbulence intensity in the wake of a wind turbine has two origins the ambient turbulence intensity Iamb and the wake induced turbulence intensity Iadd. The single wake model describes the turbulence intensity profile of the added turbulence intensity Iadd.;Both are based on the normalized wind speed deficit profile u(r)  1u(r)u0, which describes the wind speed deficit profile at a lateral distance x from the upwind turbine and radial distance r from the center of the wake. For the calculation of the wind speed deficit profile FLaP program 1 with a wake model based on Ainslie 2 is used. u0 means the incoming free wind speed. Imean(x) is an approach from Lange 1, deriving a mean turbulence intensity in the wake from the eddy viscosity calculated in the Ainslie model
