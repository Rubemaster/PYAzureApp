126 J. Cleve and M. Greiner;we modify the fBM by introducing small correlations between the fBm process and the multifractal processu t  M BH (u, du). (22.2);For the simulation the parameters have been set to utp  1, a  0.05 and b  0.4. This clones the observed correlations between , u and du. For example, the first probability ensures stationarity by turning a step of the fBm which would lead further away from utp back towards utp with a small likelihood proportional to the distance from utp.;With the correlations introduced by (22.3) and (22.4) the process (22.2) gener ates a signal that resembles a fully developed turbulent velocity field in every detail. The signstatistics p(u) and p(du) of such an artificial velocity sig nal are shown in Figs. 22.1b and 22.2b. The asymmetry apparent in these correlations is mirrored in skewed PDFs p(u) and p(du) and also changes the behaviour of the oddorder structure functions, which now also show scaling with scaling exponents close to the ones obtained from experimental data. We have crosschecked that the modifications of the fBm do not alter the scaling properties of the dissipation field.;With the combination of fBm and multifractal RMCP (and a small correlation between them) it is possible to model a turbulent velocity field which has qualitatively the same statistical properties as a real turbulent flow. Further more, the signal yields consistent dissipation statistics. The presented scheme can be used to model close to reality wind fields and is easily extendable to higher dimensions.;1. E.
