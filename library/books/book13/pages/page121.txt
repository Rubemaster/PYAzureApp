Fig. 17.1b. Mean (red) and maximal (black) wind (both at 1 min resolution) at Saint Medard dAunis (4240000)and their empirical estimates diverge with the sample size. The probability of having an extreme 10 times larger decreases only by the factor 10qD, 1qD is often called the form parameter. However, by the end of 1950s Richardsons cascade was split 6, 7 into a quasi2D macro turbulence cascade, a quasi3D micro turbulence cascade, separated by a mesoscale (energy) gap necessary to avoid contamination of the former by the latter. This gap got some initial empirical support 8, but was more and more questioned e.g. 9. Starting in the 1980s through to the present, this atmospheric model has became untenable thanks to various empirical analyses 1015 which showed that a new type of strongly anisotropic cascade operates from planetary to dissipation scales. This cascade is neither quasi2D, nor quasi3D, but has rather an elliptical dimension Del  239  2.555 (in spacetime, 299  3.222). Indeed, a scaling anisotropy could be induced by the (vertical) gravity and the resulting buoyancy forces that generate two distinct scaling expo nents for horizontal and vertical shears (Hh, respectively, Hv) of the velocity field and the elliptical dimension value is defined by Del  2 HhHv, the theoretical values Hh  13, Hv  35 being obtained by a reasoning a la Kolmogorov 16 and, respectively, a la BolgianoObukhov 17, 18. The theoretical possibility of having powerlaw pdf tail also got some empirical support with qD  7 for the velocity field 12,13.
