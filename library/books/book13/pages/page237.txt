The separation point, D, is classically defined as the point where instan taneous backfill occurs 50 of the time 6. It may then be assumed to be the location where the dispersion, , is maximum and DCp may be considered as the location where the flow is always separated which corresponds to the end of the zone 3. The point incipent detachment (ID), at which instantaneous backflow occurs 1 of the time 6, then corresponds to the beginning of the zone 3. Thus, the standard deviation bump can be interpreted, in a first ap proach, as a representation of the separation point displacement zone and the maximum standard deviation as the middle of this zone.;Coupled effects of turbulence and rotation on wind turbine airfoil aerody namics have been studied. A stall delay has been observed for the highest tur bulence level. The pressure gradient in the separated area shows an increase with the turbulence level. The instantaneous pressure distributions have been analysed. It has been assumed that the length of the  pressure coefficient bump may be assimilated with the length of the separation point displace ment zone. The method proposed to detect the separation point has to be validated with, for example, results issue from PIV or LDV experiments.;1.
