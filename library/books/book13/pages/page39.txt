SWAN has been validated for a surf zone with four alongshore bars on the Polish coast 6. Two different inputs to the model were given modelled WAM data and measured data from a directional wave rider buoy 5 km off the coast. Modelled SWAN data were compared to simultaneous wave measurements taken with three wave staffs (capacitance gauges) around 200, 400 and 550 m off the coast. Comparison of modelled and measured data is shown in Fig. 2.2. The agreement seems to be good enough for engineering purposes.
