A simple algebraic turbulence model is applied to the system (10.2) in order to close the problem. The turbulent diffusion coefficient K is expressed by;(10.3)where T ,  are the turbulent, laminar viscosities and l refers to the Black adars mixing length,   0.41 is the von Karman constant, z0 is the surface roughness length and l represents the mixing length for z  .; Wallground the wallfunction (10.4) or the noslip condition (u  v  w  0 at wall) are applied.;The grid should be fine enough close to the wall to resolve all the gradients when the noslip condition is applied. However, this increases the CPUcost of such simulation due to a stability timestep limit for the explicit scheme that is actually used, see Sect. 10.1.3. On the other hand, the wallfunction approach is less CPUtime consuming since the grid can be coarser at wall. The first inner grid cell is placed within the nearground layer of a typical thickness about 50 m. The wallfunction then reads;, (10.4)where u denotes the friction velocity and z1 refers to the distance of the center of the computational cell (where the wallfunction is applied) from the wall.;The mathematical model (10.2) is solved in the computational domain on a nonorthogonal structured grids made of hexahedral computational cells. It is expected to obtain a converged solution to the steadystate for all the unknowns and for the artificial time t  .
