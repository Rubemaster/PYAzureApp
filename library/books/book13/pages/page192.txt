Elect. Power L(u) kW u  14.6 ms Elect. Power L(u) kW u  14.6 ms;Fig. 31.2. (a) The deterministic dynamics D(1)(L) of the power for u  14.6 m s1. (b) The correspondent potential D and the power distribution P(L(u)). The minima of D are the fixed points, stablestates. Position 1 and 2 represents a fixed point and the simple average power, respectively;Fig. 31.3. Stationary power curve given by the fixed points for all wind velocity intervals, black line. The arrows represent the deterministic dynamical relaxation of the power output given by a twodimensional analysis, D(1)(L, u)
