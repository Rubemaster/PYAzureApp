The results by the two models in 4, 6 (7.2 and 7.3) are virtually identical, and downstream of the hill, 25 tree heights above the top of the trees, the difference between wind tunnel data and model results is too high. The experimental and computer result differ by a factor of 10, suggesting hidden aspects in the experimental data that are beyond model capabilities. For instance the presence of large unsteady flow structures originating from the trees at hill top, which would have gone unnoticed by a conventional averaging of the LDA measurements.;The effect of the two alternative formulations as in 6 and 4, is most obvious in the case of the wind flow along a clearing, Fig. 7.2. Model 6 yields turbu lence values which are too high everywhere, as a result of insufficient turbu lence dissipation along the forest upstream of the clearing. The two laboratory models (sinusoidal hill and flat clearing) differ also in terms of the forest den sity, which may evidence the differences between the model approaches.
