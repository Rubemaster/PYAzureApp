Summary. This contribution provides an introduction to the concept of drift and diffusion functions for complex dynamical systems such as wind energy converters. These functions easily can be estimated from measured data. However, one has to be aware about intrinsic errors in the estimation procedure that are discussed in the following.;Researchers in the field of the construction of wind energy converters are con fronted with a complex problem the number of degrees of freedom of the wind turbine is extraordinary high. In addition to the adjustable parameters of the rigid body such as the pitch of the rotorblades many dynamical modes of different parts of the converters have to be considered for a complete descrip tion. Moreover the incoming flow is turbulent and fluctuating in space as well as in time.;Complex behaviour in systems far from equilibrium can quite often betraced back to rather simple laws due to the existence of processes of self organization. For adequate order parameters the dynamics is determined by stochastic differential equations incorporating deterministic as well as stochas tic forces. Knowledge of the deterministic part of the dynamics can lead to a deeper understanding of the properties of the system under consideration while the stochastic forces account for the effects of the fluctuating microscopic degrees of freedom. For certain order parameters these forces have properties that are wellknown in the theory of stochastic processes. Imagine for example the power output of a wind turbine. Usually the power output is investigated as a function of the (mean) wind speed. Without a doubt much more para meters of the turbine effect the output power and the dynamics of the system act much faster than the common averaging periods.
