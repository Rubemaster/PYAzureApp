to use a second filtering level   . Then the subgrid scale stress tensors on the two filtering levels readij  uiuj  uiuj, Tij   uiuj  uiuj. (12.7);Lij   uiuj  uiuj  Tij  ij (12.9)is unknown in a simulation. But replacing Tij and ij by an approximation like the Smagorinsky model of (12.6) leads to six equations for the unknown Smagorinsky constant Cs.;Unfortunately solving (12.11) results in a Cs field which strongly varies in space and in time and with a significant number of negative values. In many simulations large negative values tend to destabilize the numerical simulation since they lead to a nonphysical growth of the resolved scale energy. To over come this, a statistical averaged Cs has been used for almost all reported simulations.;Applying filtering with two filter widths Liu et al. 6 introduced the unknown constant CL in a scale similarity model ij  CLLij. Later Wagner 8 pro posed to modify the dynamic process to determine CL. In his approach ij and Lij in (12.9) are substituted by (12.8). Just as in Germanos dynamic model he obtains a set of equations for the unknown constant CL;2  S  Sij) (12.12)which can be solved applying the least square method to minimize the error. Applying his model in various LES of turbulent channel flow for different
