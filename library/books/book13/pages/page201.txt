186 S. Dovgy et al.blades the coefficient of windrotor torque Cm at blades control increases 2 times in comparison with windrotor models with rigidly fixed blades. At the same time, the value of coefficient Cm of the windrotor model with 2 blades increases for the model No. 1 only by 30, and for the model No. 2 by 1520.;The measured values of the overall hydrodynamic drag for both models showed that for both windrotor models with blades control a significant decrease in coefficients of hydrodynamic drag was observed, both average Cxav, and maximal Cxmax. Thus, for the windrotor model No. 2 coefficients Cxav and Cxmax decreased by 3040, while for the windrotor model No. 1 those decreased by 34 times.;Let us add, that coefficients Cp and Cm were calculated at flow densityis equal to 1,000 kg m3, that is approximately 750 times the density of air, therefore it will be wrong to compare the results obtained in this work with other known experiments in literature, done in the air environment. From the point of view of advantages of one design of windrotor relative another, we can compare here only our results obtained in absolutely identical conditions of experiment.
