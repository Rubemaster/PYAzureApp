Average wind speed (m s1) for the period 19701987, relative devi ation of the maximum and minimum annual mean wind speed from the average (rel. min and rel. max, respectively) and that for wind energy (proportional to the cube of wind speed), estimated from monthly wind roses (cub. min and cub. max, respectively);Station Average rel. min rel. max cub. min cub. max;Gyor 2.70 (m s1) 11.8 14.3 40.3 31.5 Sopron 4.38  8.9 6.7 21.6 13.1 Szombathely 3.39 14.1 14.4 33.9 82.3 Papa 2.56 11.1 8.0 30.6 26.3 Siofok 3.17 21.0 23.4 42.8 58.8 Budaors 2.88 14.7 16.5 34.8 58.9 Budapest 2.87 15.9 19.9 46.9 72.7 Szeged 3.32 6.5 9.6 14.7 23.5 Kekesteto 4.40 23.1 12.8 55.2 35.5;Relocation of a weather station also causes significant changes. For example in Sopron (2)1 the new location of the station is a former wind mills location here the annual average wind speed increased by more than 1 m s1. The interannual variability of annual mean wind speed is an additional source of uncertainty. In Table 30.1 this uncertainty is demonstrated. The calculation is based on Annals of the Hungarian Meteorological Service. The largest values were recorded at the western boundary in Sopron (2) and at the top of Hungary, Kekesteto (1,010 m elevation). This interannual variability is the nature of the wind climate. The deviation of the annual mean from the long term average is around 10. In the wind tunnel of the Buda hills at Budaors (6), this type of deviation is about 15, at Siofok (5) near Lake Bal aton or at Kekesteto (9) this value is above 20. For the period of 20012004 we got even larger deviations. Annual average wind speed for the latter period
