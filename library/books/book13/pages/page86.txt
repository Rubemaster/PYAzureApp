Fig. 11.1. Diagram showing the solution of (11.3) (bold line). Roughness decreases along the yaxis and stable stratification increases along the xaxis. Thin lines to wards the upper right indicate power law and logarithmic profiles with equal slope, lines towards the lower right those profiles with equal curvature. Asterisks mark positions for Fig. 11.2;The practical result is that (11.2) offers a nearly perfect fit to (11.1) under stable conditions for certain surface roughness conditions and a good approx imation under neutral and unstable conditions in the limit of very smooth surfaces.;Offshore wind and turbulence profiles from the 100 m mast on the FINO1 platform in the German Bight 45 km off the coast are currently processed at our lab (project OWID, funded by the German Ministry of the Environment, BMU by grant no. 0329961). Measurement heights are 33.5, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, and 102.5 m. For comparison with (11.1) and (11.2) wind data from 2004 have been used. According to the difference between air temperature in 41 m height and water temperature the profiles have been lumped into several stability classes. Figure 11.3 shows exemplary annual mean profiles for very
