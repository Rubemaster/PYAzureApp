40 J.C.L. da Costa et al.;, (7.2)where CD and  are the tree drag coefficient and density foliage, and the closure constants are defined according with the model being used.; k Sk , (7.3)which corresponds to the formulation in 6. For simplicity, the equations above were written in Cartesian coordinates, whereas the code is in general coordinates, appropriate for computer simulation of complex terrain, cf. 1.;The ground surface was modelled by wall laws. The mean and turbulent fields at the inflow boundary followed from horizontally homogeneous atmospheric boundary layers. The velocity was tangential at the top and lat eral boundaries. At the outflow boundary the velocity was obtained by linear extrapolation from the inner nodes, constrained by global mass conservation. The pressure at the boundaries was obtained by linear extrapolation from the inner nodes. At the lateral and top boundaries the turbulent quantities were obtained by linear extrapolation.;Computer simulations of the flow over a forested (CD  0.8,   6.25 m1) sinusoidal hill and along a flat clearing, downstream of a forest (CD  0.3 and  between 6.0 and 57.5 m1) region are compared with wind tunnel measure ments 4,5.;The trees can account for an increase of both the turbulence and its dissi pation rate, yielding lower turbulence within the canopy height and higher turbulence values above the tree top. This is the trend in Fig. 7.1, for both the experimental data and the model results.
