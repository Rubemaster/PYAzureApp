PDF of Windspeed change within 2 s within a 22 h measurement at Tjare (by Bottcher, data from httpwww.winddata.com);The spectralhp element method combines the accuracy of classical spectral codes with the flexibility of finite element methods (FEM). Global spectral methods use one representation of a function u(x) by a series through the complete domain. This idea is advanced by the spectralhp method by sub dividing the domain into finite  unstructured  elements. This is done by another transformation on the spectral function. To fulfill the necessary re quirements, the spectral functions of the separate elements have to be C0;The spectralhp element method combines the accuracy of classical spectral codes with the flexibility of finite element methods (FEM). Global spectral methods use one representation of a function u(x) by a series through the complete domain. This idea is advanced by the spectralhp method by sub dividing the domain into finite  unstructured  elements. This is done by another transformation on the spectral function. To fulfill the necessary re quirements, the spectral functions of the separate elements have to be C0continuous. The subdivision into a mesh in combination with the use of unstructured meshes allows an adaption of the problem to the curved geometry and a well tuned resolution to the flowfield. There are two ways to achieve convergence using the spectralhp method. The htype convergence refers to convergence due to a refinement of the mesh,
