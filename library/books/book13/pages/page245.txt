The lift coefficients at which the liftdrag ratio has its maximum, also called the design lift, are relatively high. This makes the airfoils suitable for design of slender blades.;Comparing the measurements in the clean configuration to the 2D CFDcomputations, show excellent agreement for the 18, 24 and 27 airfoils and good agreement for the 15 airfoil lift. Estimating the performance of the RisB1 airfoil family at Re  6  106 using fully turbulent 2D CFD is believed to result in reliable maximum lift values, whereas the drag values in general will be over predicted. Such values are seen in Table 42.2.;The RisB1 airfoil family was tested in the Velux wind tunnel. The measure ments showed a very good agreement with the predicted performance. The airfoils showed as desired, high maximum lift and low roughness sensitivity.
