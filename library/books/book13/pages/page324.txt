During the design process of an offshore wind turbine the engineer has to consider the extreme load condition as well as the fatigue life. Following, the support structure for the WEC is modeled with a finite element approach using the program ANSYS. The hydrodynamic loads are calculated using different linear or nonlinear wave theories in combination with the Morison equation 1,4. Morison equation is limited to hydrodynamically transparent structures and is a summation of drag and inertia forces;u t dz (59.1)where u is the water particle kinematic perpendicular to the structure axis, CD and CM hydrodynamic coefficients, D tube diameter and  fluid density.;59.3.1 Application to the Support Structure of an Offshore Wind Turbine;In the next step the structural behavior of a monopile (Fig. 59.4) loaded by irregular waves with and without directionality of the wave field is analyzed. A reduction of the loads and the structure response up to 20 can be ob served, when the directionality is taken into account (Fig. 59.5) 3. In further examinations the effect on the fatigue will be analyzed.;In the next step the structural behavior of a monopile (Fig. 59.4) loaded by irregular waves with and without directionality of the wave field is analyzed.
