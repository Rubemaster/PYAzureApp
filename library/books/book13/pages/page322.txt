The setup of a comprehensive model suffers from the multitude ofheterogeneous modeling frameworks involved. The integrated model (IM), to be developed within the research activities of the Center for Wind Energy Research (ForWind), is supposed to reduce these shortcomings 2. Especially, the data management and the preparation or automation of simulation se quences are important aspects (Fig. 59.2). Thus, the IM has to be developed in terms of a flexible compound of modular simulation models combined with control, data base, and interface units. These interfaces are one of the main targets as they will improve and faster interacting simulations. A modular
