Fig. 47.2. Horizontal turbulence intensity profiles from multiple wake situation at Vindeby wind farm. For the double wake situation a wind direction depending ambient turbulence intensity was used;In this work, one of the authors (Arne Wessel) is funded by the scholarship program of the German Federal Environmental Foundation. We thank Ris National Laboratory Denmark, for placing the measurement data from Vin deby offshore wind farm at our disposal.;1. B. Lange, HP. Waldl, A. G. Guerrero, D. Heinemann, and R. J. Barthelmie.
