Fig. 18.3. Boundary layer representation.  U U0 for Re  102 (a), and Re  104;(b)nevertheless some differences between the two cases. The TLW train of wave length 0.8 is shifted downstream by 0.3H in the slip case, resulting in a shifted extend of the separated downslope windstorm, in phase with the wave train.;In Figs. 18.3a and b for Re  102 and Re  104, respectively, the norm of the velocity field   U  U0 is plotted on a (sH, nH) chart, on the lee side. n is the perpendicular height from surface, and s is the surfacefollowing coordinate starting on the obstacle crest. The thickness of the high velocity region defined as   U  U0 is 40 smaller at high Renumber, but in both cases the maximum velocity is located at a distance of 0.4H above the obstacle near x  3. If the obstacle were a flat plate, the boundarylayer height H would be approximately proportional to 1H for the flow parameters of the two cases. Considering Umax to delimit the boundarylayer height on the obstacles, they do not scale as standard boundary layers, implying, as expected, a strong wavefield influence. The Renumber independence suggests a oneway interaction of the wave field on the boundarylayer height.
