 A better understanding of the marine atmospheric boundary layer, ranging from mean wind profiles to high resolved influences of turbulence. These questions need further measurements as well as genuine simulations and models. A proper and detailed wind field description is indispensable for correct power and load modeling.;The positive feedback for the meetings scientific and social aspects encouraged the scientific committee to decide to have followup meetings alternately organized by Duwind, Ris and ForWind. All participants shared the opinion that the scientific interdisciplinary cooperation and international collabora tion shall be intensified.;Kuhn, Gijs van Kuik, Soeren E.
