The achievement of an integral model suffers from the diversity of differentprocesses and process interactions to be taken into account for the analysis of an offshore wind turbine and its associated subsystems. The models used by research teams and consulting engineers are normally heterogeneous. There fore, a flexible structure of the integral model is the main target of current research. A well designed objectoriented and easily extendable set of models and interfaces have to be developed in order to fulfill future demands.;This paper gives an overview of the single modules which are needed foran integrated design and how they would interact. Moreover it describes the pursued strategy for the coupling procedures and the interface design. In the first step a model for fluid structure interaction is implemented.;The numerical simulation of coupled processes (see Fig. 59.1) is essential for optimization purposes and for prediction of the breakeven performance of offshore WEC. A variety of commercial simulation tools for fluid dynamics, multibody dynamics or structural mechanics is available. Additional sophisti cated tools for specific demands are being developed or selfimproved. In order to serve several purposes an alternative use of different models is required in order to fulfill the a wide variety of modeling and simplification strategies.
