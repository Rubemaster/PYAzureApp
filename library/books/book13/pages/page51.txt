22 S.E. Larsen et al.turbine heights larger than, say 100 m. Therefore one has to account for that the eddy size is limited by h, which must enter into the formulations, supple menting the length scales, z0, z, L already being present 1.;One way of having h entering the formulations is to use local scaling, asopposed to the formulation in (4.1 and 4.2) above. Here, oftenused approxi mations are 2;opposed to the formulation in (4.1 and 4.2) above. Here, oftenused approxi mations are 2u,l u,0;with   1  3,where we have taken subscript 0 to refer to surface values and l to local values, meaning at height, z. Local scaling has often been found to work well with data when larger heights or heterogeneous conditions are involved 3.;LN reflects the role of the stability of free atmosphere for the growths of the boundary layer, and thereby for its largest eddies. Several methods exist for combination of the various length scales. For the Lscales, the following method can be applied 4;For changing surface conditions the boundary layer develops internalboundary layers reflecting the new surfaces. These IBLs generally develops slower and slower as the fetch and thereby the height increases. Therefore greater heights will tend to reflect surface conditions upstream and the far ther upstream the larger the measuring height 5.;The Hvsre test site for large wind turbines is situated at the Danish North Sea coast, with one 100 m. climatology mast, and two 165 m warning light masts. The site is situated about 1,500 m. from the shoreline, meaning that for flows from West, measurements for z  about 50 m can be considering
