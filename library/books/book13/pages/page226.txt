The flow field unsteadiness is presented in terms of the time history of ;Fig. 38.3. The PIV vorticity field and the corresponding lasersheet visualization pictures around the airfoil at instant marked a and b in Fig. 38.2b at   40occurring at   40 3 should be caused by the primary periodic movement in the flow field. 3. For  50, although flow field is much more periodic, no perceptible influence can be found in the corresponding PSD of force.
