52 Fatigue Assessment of Truss Joints Based on Local Approaches 283a standard unnotched specimen. Differences in surface, residual stresses and in size of structures and test specimens can be considered. Crack initiation is defined as a crack length of c  0.5 mm, which is a crack depth a  0.25 mm. As a result the number of cycles for crack initiation is obtained (Seeger 1).;The computation of the local stressstrain history can either be done byfull elasticplastic finiteelementcalculations with true strains, or by linear elastic calculations with subsequent approximation of the plastic behaviour, e.g. by Neubersrule 2;The influence of mean stresses, i.e. the case R  1, can be considered by;The influence of mean stresses, i.e. the case R  1, can be considered bydamage parameters P, e.g. in the form of Smith et al. 6;52.2.3 Crack Growth with Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics;The calculation of crack propagation with linear elastic fracture mechanics starts at the crack depth a  0.25 mm from local strain approach. The crack depth dependent stressintensityfactors KI(a) can be computed with FEM software, e.g. FRANC2DL 8. A defined fracture criterion stops the calcu lation resulting in the number of cycles for crack growth.;Crack propagation can be calculated with the Parislaw 9dadN  C(K)m. (52.5)
