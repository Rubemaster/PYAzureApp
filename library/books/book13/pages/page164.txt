Power production in wind farms faces fluctuations on various levels. On the level of a single turbine it is the fluctuation of the wind velocity. The intra farm wind flow introduces more heterogeneity. At last, the accumulated power output of a wind farm itself represents a volatile source for the power grid. It is this layer which demands for a control of these source fluctuations as well as those resulting from intragrid power redistribution.;New concepts for such a control can be borrowed from modern informationand communication technologies. With a distributive routing and conges tion control selforganizing communication networks are able to adapt to the volatile traffic sources and the current networkwide congestion state 1, 2. As a result network operation becomes very robust. The exportation of these ideas into windpowered systems requires to see wind farms as well as the power grid from the network perspective 3.;This contribution represents a first modest step along this network direction. It makes use of the criticalinfrastructure model proposed in 4, which describes power grids, telecommunication and transport networks in abstracted form. The introduction of a loaddependent metric, a concept which is borrowed from Internet routing, is shown to increase the robustness of such networks against cascades of overload failures. It also reduces respec tive investment costs. Finally, two model extensions are developed, which are of relevance for a robust interaction between windenergy sources and the power grid.;The network model of 4 does not distinguish source, transmitter, and sink nodes. Every node providesreceives flow tofrom every other node of the network with an equal share sif  1. After generation at node i, the flow
