The measured airfoil configurations presented in this paper is (1) Clean surface with no aerodynamic devices mounted on the airfoil (Clean), (2) Standard leading edge roughness (LER) simulated by zigzag tape mounted at the suc tion side at xc  0.05 and at the pressure side at xc  0.10 (Standard LER) and (3) Severe LER simulated by zigzag tape mounted at the suction side from the very leading edge towards the trailing edge (Severe LER). A description of the test is found in 6.;The measured characteristics for the RisB1 airfoils at Re  1.6  106 with clean surface and simulated leading edge roughness are reflected in Fig. 42.1 and Fig. 42.2. Also, corresponding 2D CFD computations at Re  1.6  106;The measured characteristics for the RisB1 airfoils at Re  1.6  106 with clean surface and simulated leading edge roughness are reflected in Fig. 42.1 and Fig. 42.2. Also, corresponding 2D CFD computations at Re  1.6  106are shown. Key parameters reflecting the performance of the airfoils are seen in Table 42.1. Values of maximum lift for the clean configuration show that the design objective for high maximum lift was met. The performance with standard LER, which probably is the way of simulation of LER that;Fig. 42.1. Measurements with clean surface, standard LER and severe LER.
