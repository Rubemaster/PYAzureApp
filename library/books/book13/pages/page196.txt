Gaussian distributed around V with variance 2  2 and the difference between the actual and the real power decays exponentially. The factor  (inverse relaxation time) is just a constant in this approach but might well be extended to a more complex function as proposed by 4. For different mean velocities V and defining;Prated, u  urated, (32.7)the corresponding wind speed and the resulting power output time series can be reconstructed by integration of (32.6). Prated and urated denote the turbine specific rated power and the corresponding rated velocity.;In a first step we apply the IECnorm to determine the power curve fromthe time series. As can be seen from Fig. 32.1 the resulting power curve differs significantly from the real one, the more the larger the turbulence intensity. This means that although the evolution of the power is purely deterministic the standard averaging procedure is  as a matter of principle  not able to reproduce the correct power curve.;P (u, P)  0 as anew procedure for the evaluation of the real power curve. The power curve is reconstructed well by this approach even for very large turbulence intensities such as   30 as also shown in Fig. 32.1.;Fig. 32.1. The real power curve is indicated by a thick solid line. The open sym bols represent the reconstructed curves according to the IECstandard for turbulence intensities of   10 (dashed line with circles),   20 (dashed line with trian gles), and   30 (dashed line with diamonds). The filled squares represent the zero crossings of D(1)
