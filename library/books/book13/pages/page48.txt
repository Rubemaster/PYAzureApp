Fig. 3.4. COV of the blade equivalent flap moment range (left generic turbine) and the flap moment range at the hub (right NM802750). Mean wind speeds are indicated at bottom legend indicates number of anemometersconstraints;Fig. 3.5. Comparison between measurement and calculations (constrained wind in 1 point rotor centre). Left electrical power at 14.7 ms1 right pitch angle at 19.5 ms1;In Fig. 3.4 (left) no clear trend can be observed the reduction of the COVby constrained simulation is limited. Noticeable improvement is obtained how ever for the hub flap bending moment (right).;Whether it is useful to use constrained wind in load verification can only be determined from a practical test. To this end we use the NEG Micon NM80 turbine in Tjreborg (flat, open coastal terrain). The metmast is located 200 m upwind of the turbine and has anemometers at 25, 41 and 60 m. Because the wind must come from a direction where the rotor sees the wind measured by the anemometer, only few measuring records could be used.
