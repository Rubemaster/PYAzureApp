38 J. Fernandez Puga et al.;The knowledge of the atmospheric flow over hills is of high importance in wind energy purposes. In order to predict the energy production rate of wind energy converters numerical calculations of the flow field are necessary when no measurements are available. Due to the fact that the flow phenomena in the atmosphere are turbulent the choice of the right turbulence model is essential. It has been shown that the velocity field has been calculated in agreement with the measurements in the wind tunnel of the University of Kaiserslautern using the k   RNG and the k   SST turbulence model as well as a secondorder discretization scheme and a refined nearwall mesh. Best agreement is achieved performing a largeeddy simulation.;1. Fernandez Puga J, Fallen M, Ebert F (2003) Wind energy converter siting inforest landscapes. In Conference Proceedings of EWEC 2003.
