116 S. Barth et al.u a.u.;Fig. 20.1. Schematic illustration of different mean velocity intervals. Within these intervals statistics should be the same as for isotropic, homogenous and stationary turbulence. The magnitude of variations (standard deviation) grows with mean velocity;We found that the observed intermittent form of PDFs for all examined scales is the result of mixing statistics belonging to different flow situations. These are characterized by different mean velocities as schematically illustrated in Fig. 20.1.;When the analysis by means of increment statistics is conditioned on periods with constant mean velocities results are very similar to those of isotropic turbulence. Note that the definition of the mean velocities requires a sepa ration of scales, which would not exist for a pure fractal process. But the change in statistics we take as hint that there is a separation of scales. This is a controversial issue, which will be tackled further in future.;The change of shape of the PDFs can be described by the Castaing distribution that interprets intermittent PDFs p(u) as a superposition of Gaussian ones p(u) with standard deviation . The standard deviation itself is dis tributed according to a lognormal distribution. The Castaing distribution thus reads;bution that interprets intermittent PDFs p(u) as a superposition of Gaussian ones p(u) with standard deviation . The standard deviation itself is dis tributed according to a lognormal distribution. The Castaing distribution thus readsp(uu) ;Two parameters enter this formula, namely 0 and 2. The first is the median of the lognormal distribution, the second its variance. The latter determines the form (shape) of the resulting distribution p(u) and is therefore called form parameter.;PDFs as a superposition of isotropic turbulent subsets that are denoted with p(uu) and given by (20.1). Knowing the distribution of the mean velocity h(u) the PDFs become
