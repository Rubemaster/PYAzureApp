In order to improve the performance of wind turbines (WT) and to reduce discrepancies between concerned parties, testing standards have been de veloped. Those proposed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 6140012) constitute an international reference. However, several aspects treated in these standards are not perfectly well understood or are based on inappropriate assumptions. For example, the power performance verification of a wind park on complex terrain raises significant difficulties related to the technique of nacelle anemometry 1. The goal of the present study is to eva luate the precision of this technique on complex terrain.;To perform this study, experimental installations have been deployed on a very complex site in Eastern Canada. Three WTs are present at the RiviereAu Renard Wind Farm (PER). The WT have a nominal power of 750 kW, with a rotor diameter of 48 m and a hub height of 46 m. They are active control WT, with variable speed and fixed pitch angle. The rotational speed, with a range between 8.5 and 24.8 rpm, is adjusted in order to operate as often as possible at the optimal point, CP,max. This CP,max of 0.425 occurs approximately at a tip speed  of 7.2 (  RV, where  represents the rotational speed and R is the rotor radius);An experimental analysis has been undertaken. The first step was to perform a site calibration. For every valid sectors of 10, a correlation between Vref  V
