Probability tails of the wind increments of the two horizontal components of the data of Fig. 17.1a and of Fig. 17.1b, respectivelythat the wind maxima distribution is a Frechet law 21, often called Gener alized Extreme Value distribution of type 2 (GEV2), instead of the more classical Gumbel law (GEV1). GEV1 and GEV2 are quite distinct, since GEV1 has the same power law exponent qD as the original series, whereas GEV2 has a very thin tail corresponding to a double (negative) exponential. This sharp contrast results from the fact that a Frechet variable corresponds to the exponential of a Gumbel variable, therefore its distribution is often called LogGumbel. We will illustrate this with the help of MeteoFrance wind data, in particular those collected during the two inland hurricanes
