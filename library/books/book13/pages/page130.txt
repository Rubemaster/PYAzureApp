The velocity field up and downstream of the obstacle has been measured in the laboratory. Contrary to the influence of the onobstacle slip condi tion, the afterobstacle slip condition has no major dynamical effect on the flow field. The boundarylayer separation on the obstacle is waveinduced and leads to TLW with embedded rotors. The wave field also appears to control the boundarylayer thickness, independently of the Renumber. Given these results, if the windfield  including its direction  near the ground and at higher altitudes is to be correctly predicted, the noslip condition is necessary to be used up to at least the location of the first half internalwave length.;1.
