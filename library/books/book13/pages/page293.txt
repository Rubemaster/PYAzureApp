Fig. 52.3. Lives to fracture of PCGPjoint, series R2, tests and computed resultsend of a welded platestiffenerconnection after approximately 4  105 load cycles.;Kottgen et al. 17 answered the question about the fatigue resistance ofthe detail on the basis of nominal stresses, structural (geometric) stresses and effective notch stresses (local stress approach).;In fact, the GROWIANstiffenerdetail has a special membrane and bending stress situation that can not be found in any nominal stresses based FAT catalogue. As a result, the similar situation of a long stiffener on a plate gave a sufficient fatigue resistance, which was obviously wrong.;Both the structural stress and the local stress approach showed an insufficient fatigue resistance for the detail. The structural stress approach predicted a failure at about 4  105 but the result depends on the way of extrapolating the stress field to get the structural stresses and on the selection of a suitable Wohlercurve.;The local stress approach is independent of the overall geometry. Thecalculation predicted a failure after about 2  105 load cycles which was in good correspondence with the 4  105 cycles for failure.
