T. Neumann, S. Emeis, and C. Illig;The chapter gives an overview of the research project OWID that has been launched in mid2005. Aim of the project is to make proposals to improve offshore related standards and guidelines on the basis of measured FINO1 data and CFD calculations. Some examples for the motivation of the research project and a first glance on some preliminary results are given.;Within the project OWID the FINOdata are used to reduce incompleteknowledge when adapting wind turbines to the maritime conditions. We start with a thorough evaluation of the acquired FINO1 data with the focus on the mechanical loads a future wind turbine is exposed to. In addition to the undisturbed wind field the disturbed wind stream within the wake field is sim ulated by CFD models as we think that the major part of the load originates in the wake fields. Both undisturbed and disturbed wind fields are used to calculate the loads on a realistic offshore wind turbine with regard to the lay out and the life time.;At present external wind conditions in the offshore regime are defined in guidelines by GL, IEC and DNV 3, 5. It is an usual approach within the guidelines to define a reference and average wind speed for certain classes together with parameters for different turbulence regimes as shown in Fig. 14.1 for the GLoffshore guideline 5. While the DNV 3 and IEC 4 guidelines still refer to the onshore related IEC614001 6, the GLOffshore 5 already introduced a special subclass C with a lower assumption for the turbulence as
