Wen Zhong Shen, Martin O.L. Hansen and Jens Nrkr Srensen;For a 2D airfoil the angle of attack (AOA) is defined as the geometrical angle between the flow direction and the chord. The concept of AOA is widely used in aeroelastic engineering models (i.e. FLEX and HAWC) as an input to tabulated airfoil data that normally are established through a combination of wind tunnel tests and corrections for the effect of Coriolis and centrifugal forces in a rotating boundary layer. For a rotating blade the flow passing by a blade section is bended due to the rotation of the rotor, and the local flow field is influenced by the bound circulation on the blade. As a further complication, 3D effects from tip and root vortices render a precise definition of the AOA difficult.;Today, there exists a lot of experimental and numerical (CFD) data fromwhich precise airfoil data may be extracted. However, this leaves us with the problem of determining lift and drag polars as function of the local AOA. To determine the AOA from e.g. a computed flow field, two techniques have up to now been used. The first technique corresponds to an inverse Blade Element  Momentum (BEM) method in which a measured or computed load distribution is used as input. The technique gives reasonable results and the extracted airfoil data can be tabulated and used for later predictions using the same BEM method. Since the theory is 1D, the accuracy of the extracted airfoil data is restricted to the 1D limitation. Moreover, a BEM code needs a tip correction different tip corrections results in different airfoil data. The second technique is the averaging technique (AT) employed in 2,3. This method gives good results, especially in the middle section of a blade. Since the method utilizes averaged data, many input points are needed to evaluate the local flow features. Furthermore, it is difficult to be used for general flow conditions (e.g. at operations in yaw).
