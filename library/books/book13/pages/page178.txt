To evaluate a power curve measured with a specific turbulence these two factors have to be determined. Equation (28.1) can be rewritten as follows;P (v)i  P0i (vi)  ki2i . (28.3);To solve this equation we need for each bin at least two sets of values. If we have more than two sets, the redundant equations can be used to minimise the error of the computation using the leastsquare method.;Data is being presented in for moderate wind speeds from 78 ms. Figure 28.2 shows three curves each. The horizontal line (dashed) shows the uncorrected;Fig. 28.2.
