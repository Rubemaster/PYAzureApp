D. Cabezon, A. Iniesta, E. Ferrer and I. Mart;Assessing wind conditions on complex terrain has become a hard task as terrain complexity increases. That is why there is a need to extrapolate in a reliable manner some wind parameters that determine wind farms viability such as annual average wind speed at all hub heights as well as turbulence intensities.;The development of these tasks began in the early 1990s with the widelyused linear model WAsP and WAsP Engineering especially designed for sim ple terrain with remarkable results on them but not so good on complex orographies. Simultaneously nonlinearized NavierStokes solvers have been rapidly developed in the last decade through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes allowing simulating atmospheric boundary layer flows over steep complex terrain more accurately reducing uncertainties.;This paper describes the features of these models by validating themthrough meteorological masts installed in a highly complex terrain. The study compares the results of the mentioned models in terms of wind speed and tur bulence intensity.;Alaiz hill is 4 km long, 1,050 m high a.s.l. and is surrounded by a complex terrain associated to a ruggedness index (RIX) of 16. The roughness level is high since the hill is covered by dense forests whereas the area upwind is clear without remarkable roughness elements.;(Alaiz2, Alaiz3, and Alaiz6) forming a one year data base composed by hourly wind speed and wind direction values. Direction analysis afforded two main prevailing sectors at north and south.
