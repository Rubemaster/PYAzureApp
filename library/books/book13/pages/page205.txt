DFIG outages due to crowbar ignitions. The crowbar closing itself provides no clue about the origin of the failure. Although the failuretimecircle first sug gested an external distortion source, dclink problems were the real cause of the device outages. This reaction was only triggered by some external voltage events far from limits.;During tripping, high voltage peaks on the WEC output were detectedby the protection devices. Current increase up to shortcircuit values, fol lowed by the shutdown of the WEC were measured on some turbines, see Fig. 34.3a,b. These results show, that the external effects may only trigger an internal device problem.;The measurements show, that the allocation of failures to internal and external sources causes some effort. This is not always acceptable for wind park oper ators in practice. Such outages reduce the economic efficiency of wind parks considerably. A detrimental influence on the gear is obvious, but not specified, yet, by simulations or measurements.;3. Plotkin Y., Saniter C., Schulz D., Hanitsch R. (2005) Transients in doublyfed;3.
