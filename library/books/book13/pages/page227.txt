214 H. Guo et al.and b in Fig. 38.2b at   40, which correspond to the minimum and maximum lift, respectively. It can be observed from these pictures that;1. The flow around the airfoil is dominated by alternately rolling up andshedding of large vortices from leading and trailing edge. Laser sheet visualization reveals the separated shear layer rolling up into smaller vortices, smaller vortices amalgamating into a large vortex.;2. Maximum lift occurs when the large vortex just formed from the leadingedge and before its shedding downstream, as shown in Fig. 38.3b. The area occupied by this vortex is characterized by higher negative vorticity. When the minimum of the lift is reached, the large vortex evolves from the trailing edge, as shown in Fig. 38.3a.;1.
