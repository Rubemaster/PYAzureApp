4 Mean Wind and Turbulence in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer 25scaling, and that the boundary layer height changes somewhat systematically with zL in the plots. For unstable conditions, uu is known to depend on hL rather than on zL, where h is the boundary layer height. This is likely to explain the scatter for uu for unstable condition.;We have not used h directly as a scaling parameter in this paper because itis presently not measured. For the wind speed profiles we have not discussed the unstable profiles much, but they are well described by the standard profile formulations, surface layer leading to free convection and mixed layer formu lations as the height increases.;1.
