This contribution is on power prediction of wind energy converters (WEC) with emphasis on the effect of the delayed response of the WEC to fluctuating winds. Let us consider the wind speedpower diagram, Fig. 27.1a, with a typical power curve of a 2 MW turbine.;Suppose at time t0 the system is at working point U0, L0 outside thepower curve with a wind speed U0 which is constant for a long time. Then, for t  t0, the system will move toward the power curve, either from above or from below. The power curve acts as an attractor 2. What happens in a fluctuating wind field? Let us follow a shorttime series in the windspeed power diagram, see Fig. 27.1b. We start at some time t0 with a wind speed U(t0) and a power output L(t0). At the next time step, one observes a jump to the point U(t1), L(t1), then to the point U(t2), L(t2), and so on. In Fig. 27.1b, consecutive points are connected by straight lines to form a trajectory. In the ideal case of an instantaneous response of the turbine, and in the absence of noise, all points would lie on the power curve. Actually, the turbine reacts with a delayed response to the windspeed fluctuations. The timely changes of the wind speed, U, together with a finite response time hamper accurate power prediction by means of the power curve alone. The application of a suitable reponse theory may help to properly include the influence of turbulent wind in the power assessment. In Fig. 27.2 we show a typical point cluster which is broadly spread around the power curve.;In the following we will discuss in some detail the main idea of a previouslypublished phenomenological response theory 1. We also will propose an extremal principle to establish an empirical power curve from measurement data 4. The method is similar but not identical to the attractor principle applied elsewhere 2. In addition we present an elementary theorem on power prediction in the case of a constant relaxation time of the WEC.
