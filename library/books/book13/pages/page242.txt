Fig. 41.4. 3D Simulation Velocity and vector field for radius of 1.5 m;An evaluation of highresolution 2Dsimulations for different profiles is going to be performed. Then a model for comparing 2D and 3D angle of attack has to be chosen. At the moment we prefer the stagnation point method. Afterwards 2D and 3D lift and dragcoefficients will be calculated and differences will be discussed. Furthermore the vortex system near the hub area is going to be investigated.;1. H.
