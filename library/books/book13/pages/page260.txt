248 J.N. Srensen and V.L. Okulov;Fig. 45.3. Artistic impression of lowfrequency meandering of the wake behind a wind turbine (a) in space and (b) in the Trefftz plane. Time histories of the axial velocity (c) measured 5 and (d) computed;The classical vortex model of Joukowski has been extended by specifying an inner vortex structure. The new model enables us to calculate induced velocities in very good agreement with measurements. The model may further explain the very high peaks appearing in the time signal of the axial velocity measured near the center of the tip vortices of unsteady far wakes. The work was supported by the Danish Energy Agency under the project Dynamic Wake Modeling and the RFBR (no. 040100124). The authors thank David Medici for providing the experimental data.;1.
