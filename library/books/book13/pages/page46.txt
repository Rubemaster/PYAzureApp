3 Time Domain Comparison Using Constrained Wind Fields 17centre) and is used in combination with Flex5. The other applies a Cartesian grid (15 by 15) and produces wind fields which can be read by Bladed. In order to investigate the influence of the number of measuring points several configurations of anemometers (ranging from 1 to 11) have been considered. In Fig. 3.1 two of the considered configurations are shown. One of the simulated wind fields can be appointed to be the measured wind field. The reduced scatter in the constrained wind time series is shown in Fig. 3.2. The shape of the time series gets more fixed (determined by the measured wind speeds). Unconstrained wind fields will average out to straight horizontal lines the variance will be uniform over the rotor plane.;Fig. 3.2. Left contour plot of the variance of the spatial constrained wind fields (averaged over time) over the rotor plane. Right the mean (and plusminus one standard deviation) of 30 constrained (7 anemometers) simulations 17 m below the rotor centre
