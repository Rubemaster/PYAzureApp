25 Wind Farm Power Fluctuations 141the wind turbine under test. For the present study, only wind measurements in the height 805 m are used.;The PSD of the wind speed in 80 m height is measured, based on data acquired in only 3 months, from 7 July to 9 October 2003. A total of 1787 h data, corresponding to 74 full days, has been acquired and saved in that period. Met mast 5 has been selected for the PSD estimation, and only data in the wind direction sector from 120 to 330 deg has been used to ensure that wake effects from wind turbines are not included.;To obtain values of the PSD for low frequencies, the PSDs are based ontime series of 32768 s length, i.e. more than 9 h.;Figure 25.2 shows the resulting measured PSDs for data sectors with 9 hmean wind speed (71) m s1 and (142) m s1, respectively. For compari son, also a Kaimal spectrum 3 is shown. It is seen that the Kaimal spec trum is valid for the higher frequencies, but the measured spectrum has much more energy at low frequencies. To represent this lowfrequency energy, a low frequency spectrum has been added, shown as Kaimal  LF.;(1  33  n)53 , (25.1)where n is a dimensionless frequency, expressed by height above ground z, mean wind speed V0 and frequency in Hz, f according to (25.2)
