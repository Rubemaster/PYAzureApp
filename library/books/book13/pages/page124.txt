The hypothesis of short range correlations, which is necessary to derive the classical extreme value theory, is not satisfied by cascade processes. Indeed, the latter introduce power law dependencies. It is therefore indispensable to look for a generalization of extreme value theory in a multifractal framework. This task might be not as difficult as it looks at first glance, since for instance cascade processes may have (statistical) mixing properties 22, 23, which have been used to extend the extreme value theory from uncorrelated time series to those having short range correlations. This may partially explain why GEV2 fits rather well the empirical extremes, although one may expect that its asymptotic powerlaw exponent might differ from that of the probability tail of the original time series. Larger data bases and numerical cascade simulations are currently being analysed to clarify these issues. However, it may be already timely to use multifractal wind generators in numerical simulations for the design and management of wind turbines.;1.
