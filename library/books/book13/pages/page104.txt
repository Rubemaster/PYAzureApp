Fig. 14.1. WEAclasses according to the GLOffshore guideline 4can be seen in Fig. 14.1. For the standard classes a Rayleigh distribution of the wind speed is assumed, for the site specific class a Weibull distribution is used, based on individual measurements. For the FINO1 site Weibull parameters A  11.1 m s1 and k  2.16 have been found by an analysis of the data up to January 2005.;Preliminary results shall be presented for two parameters of the normal wind conditions. The first one is the normal wind profile (NWP) that is defined quite similar in the abovementioned guidelines. The mean wind speed V at height z is consistently given as a potential law;V (z)  Vhub(zzhub)a, (14.1)where Vhub is the wind speed at hub height zhub. Figure 14.2 shows the on shore wind profile (a  0.2) according to IEC614001 6 in comparison with the offshore profiles defined by 4, 5 (a  0.14). In addition, mean wind profiles as measured at the FINO1 platform during 2004 have been plotted. As could be expected, the onshore NWP exaggerates the measured wind profile, while the assumption in the GL and IEC614003 seems to reproduce the right trend, as for the measured mean wind profile it looks like a conser vative assumption. The strong dependence of the profile on the atmospheric stability however is neglected. When Twater is less than Tsea, the measured profile exaggerates the profile of 4,5 drastically. It must be mentioned that these observations are preliminary and must be assured by a more detailed analysis during the OWID project.
