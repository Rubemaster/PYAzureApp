Fig. 27.1. (a) Schematic power curve as an attractor. (b) 20s (U, L) trajectory in relation to the power curve. Horizontal and vertical units are m s1 and kW, respectively;An inspection of the point cluster in Fig. 27.2 suggests to define an empirical power curve by the location where, in a given speed bin, the maximal density of points L(ti) is found. This extremal property is expected, if the power curve is an attractor. In previous work 2, the following expectation values were considered jk   L(ti1)  L(ti) Uj,Lk with the suffix Uj, Lk denoting the restriction to the speed and power bin Uj and Lk, respectively. For a given speed bin Uj, the corresponding point on the power curve was defined by the power bin Lk(j) where jk(j) changes sign. In practice this may cause a problem, if for a given speed bin there are several locations with sign change. The maximum principle, on the other hand, should give a unique result after properly defining the bin sizes
