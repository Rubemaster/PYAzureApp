Profiles and frequencies of different classes of thermal conditions at FINO1we use the single wind shears between 33 and 51 m height to calculate m in order to provide the ICWPmodel with information about the stability of the atmospheric stratification, the RMSE is reduced to 3.6 at 103 m height.;1.
