The wind quality of a site is neither controllable nor improvable by wind en ergy specialists. The wind turbines arrangement in a wind farm is however designed by them before the implantation of a wind farm, in order to minimize turbine interactions. It is therefore of great interest to correctly assess these interactions. Since the field measurements are rare and difficult to interpret, wind turbine wakes and their interactions are usually treated with numeri cal models. An alternative to this is the physical modelling in wind tunnels. Indeed, its degree of modelling is lower than for numerical approaches.;Wind turbines are not plain obstacles and can be considered as porouselements, extracting kinetic energy from the flow, distorting streamlines and generating turbulence. The use of a porositydrag approach, inspired from concepts developed to model the urban of forest canopy flows (numerical 1 and physical 2,3) may be well adapted to simulate the wind turbine wake.;1400 wind turbines with metallic mesh discs to replicate the actuator discs. A parametric study of the flow field downstream of the wind turbine model has been performed in a homogeneous and turbulent approaching flow upon the disc size, the porosity level, the mesh size. Then the interaction between several porous discs located in a modelled atmospheric boundary layer was studied in order to model an offshore located wind farm.;The wind turbines were modelled according to the actuator disc concept. The actuator disc extracts kinetic energy, generating a spreading of the stream tube, a velocity deficit downstream of the disc and an appearance of shear generated turbulence. A porous disc produces exactly the same features 2. Discs of 100 mm, 200 mm and 300 mm of diameter (D), made of metallic mesh,
