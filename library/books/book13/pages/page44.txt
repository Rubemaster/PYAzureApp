Summary. By means of socalled constrained simulation, wind fields can be generated which encompass measured wind speed series. If the method of constrained wind is used in load verification, the low frequency part of the wind and of the loads can be reproduced well, which makes it possible to compare time traces directly. However from the three load cases for the reference wind turbine investigated here, it appeared that there was no clear improvement in fatigue damage equivalent load ranges.;Comparison between wind turbine load measurements and simulations is com plicated by the uncertainty about the wind field experienced by the rotor. Usually the wind speed is measured at just one location (hub height) which makes direct comparison between the measured and simulation load time his tories impossible. Instead random wind fields are generated (with the same mean and spectrum as the measured wind) and the power spectra of the loads or the equivalent fatigue load ranges are compared. The next section will present a method of socalled constrained stochastic simulation. By means of this method wind fields may be generated which encompass measured wind speed series i.e. one or more measured wind speed signals are reproduced ex actly. Subsequently the constrained wind fields as well as the resulting wind turbine loading will be dealt with. Comparisons of the results of actual load measurements and simulated loads, found by using constrained wind fields based on measured wind, are given in Sect. 3.5.
