Cn()  (1  ) Cn . (26.6);The tolerance parameter  is assumed to be the same for every node. The larger , the larger network robustness will be against a twonodeinduced cascading failure.;Only a fraction of the nodes is still functioning after such a cascadingfailure, i.e., their load is still smaller than their capacity (26.6). This fraction does not necessarily form a connected network. Usually these nodes cluster into nonconnected subnetworks. The largest of these subnetworks, i.e. the one containing the largest number Ngc of nodes, is called the giant component. Figure 26.2 shows the relative size NgcN of the surviving giant component, belonging to an initial random scalefree network and obtained after removal of the two mostloaded nodes. As expected, it is close to zero for very small tolerance parameters. For larger values of  the size of the giant component very much depends on the chosen metric. For the loaddependent metric it is significantly larger than for the hop metric. This result is independent of the network size. Consequently, the additional investment costs to establish network robustness beyond onenode failure are also smaller upon application of the loaddependent metric than for the hop metric.;All results presented so far are not restricted to scalefree networks. Othertypes of networks, like those with a Poisson or exponential degree distribu tion, have also been studied. Together with a further investigation of a model;Fig. 26.2. The relative size of the giant network component surviving a cascading failure induced by the removal of the two mostloaded nodes is shown as a function of the tolerance parameter. The dashedsolid curves refer to the hoploaddependent metric, respectively, and have been averaged over 50 independent realizations of random scalefree networks with parameter   3. From top to bottom at large , the respective curves correspond to network sizes N  1000, 500, 200, and 100
