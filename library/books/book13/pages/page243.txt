Summary. This paper presents the measurements on the RisB1 airfoil family with relative thicknesses of 15, 18, 24 and 27 tested in the Velux wind tunnel. The measurements carried out at a Reynolds number of 1.6  106 showed that the airfoils have a high maximum lift and that they are very insensitive to leading edge roughness. This makes the airfoils suitable for design of less solid rotors and still obtain reliable energy production.;The RisB1 airfoil family was developed with a relative thickness range from 15 to 53 and with high maximum lift 1. They were designed for megawatt size wind turbines with pitch control and variable rotor speed (PRVS). For PRVS wind turbines a high maximum lift (cl,max) with a corresponding high design lift means that less solid rotors can be obtained. The reduced solidity potentially ensures savings in manufacturing the blades and reduced loads on the remaining components of the turbine. Furthermore, the airfoils were designed for high driving force in the chordwise direction, to be insensitive to leading edge roughness and to have a smooth trailing edge stall despite of the high lift. The design Reynolds number was Re  6  106 and was based on a design tool for multipoint airfoil design 2 coupled to XFOIL. For evaluation the CFD solver, EllipSys2D, 3,4 was used. The design of the series and measurements of the 18 and 24 airfoil were reported in 1 and since then measurements on the 15 and 27 airfoil have been carried out. Therefore, this paper presents the verification of the performance of the 15, 18, 24 and 27 RisB1 airfoils.;The RisB1 airfoils were tested in the Velux wind tunnel in Denmark. This tunnel and the measuring techniques are described and verified in detail in 5.
