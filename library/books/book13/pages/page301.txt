Support structures of offshore wind energy converters for medium to high water depths are supposedly carried out as braced or lattice constructions. Due to the combined dynamic loads from wind and waves the fatigue design is of special interest. The large variety in type and dimensions of tubular joints requires a fatigue design with local approaches.;The authors gave an overview of expected types of support structures in 1. Stateoftheart in current offshore standards is the structural stress approach. More sophisticated concepts like the notch stress approach and notch strain approach 2, here referred to as local approaches, require detailed FE mod elling of the mesoscale weld shape.;The applied notch stress approach is based on the recommendations in 3,but with a modified slope of the SN curve with m  5 for ND  5  106 and without a cutoff limit. This modification fits well to the results of 4 in the highcycle fatigue range. A fictitious weld toe fillet with a radius f1 mm is applied to the FE model to account for microstructural support. The notch strain approach uses stabilized cyclic material data according to the uniform material law (UML). For the material in the heataffected zone (HAZ) an increased hardness is considered. To include the mean stress effects, the damage parameter given by;(a  m)aE (54.1)has been used. Together with the equations by Manson, Coffin and Morrow this leads to a relevant PN curve. As the shear strains are low for the
