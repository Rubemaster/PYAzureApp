18 W. Bierbooms and D. Veldkamp;The (un)constrained wind fields have been used as input for two standard wind turbine design tools Flex5 and Bladed. Both packages feature among other things dynamic inflow, stall hysteresis and tip losses. Logarithmic wind shear is assumed and tower shadow is taken into account. In Flex5 the NEG Micon NM80275060 is considered and in Bladed a generic 2 MW turbine. Both are pitchregulated variable speed and have a diameter of 80 m, hub height of 60 m the rated power is 2,750 kW and 2,000 kW respectively.;As example the time series of the calculated blade root flapping momentis shown in Fig. 3.3 based on the wind fields of Fig. 3.2. The response based on the measured wind is assigned measured load. The 1P (1.9 rads) response is clearly visible. The mean response of the constrained simulations gets more detailed, with increasing number of anemomenters  constraints, and the standard deviation decreases since the wind fields gets more fixed. Comparison with the filtered measured load shows that the constrained response captures the low frequency phenomena well.;In order to consider fatigue, the damage equivalent load ranges are considered of the blade root flapping moment (SN slope 12). The load ranges and the frequencies of occurrence are found with the usual rain flow counting procedure.;It is anticipated that constrained simulation results into a smaller scatter of the obtained equivalent damage. As measure for the scatter the COV (coefficient of variation) is taken. The convergence of the COV has been checked by doing 100 simulations for a particular situation. It turned out that about 20 simulations are enough the uncertainty in the COV is about 0.1 to 0.2.;Fig. 3.3. Generic turbine Left, top measured flap moment bottom filtered flap moment.
