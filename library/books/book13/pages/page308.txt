The results of the preloaded and subsequently UPtreated specimens are even better than the results of the immediate treated ones but it has to be taken into consideration that the UP treatment has been slightly optimized. For more details see 3,4.;Test results show that the application of shot peening and UP on fatigue loaded butt welds and double bevel seams produce a high enhancement of the fatigue strength or life time. Ultrasonic methods proved to be simply manageable preventive or repair methods with similar beneficial effects as shot peening, also increasing the fatigue life of preloaded notch details. It appeared that the positive effects are based on strain hardening connected with positive residual compressive stresses.;1. Manteghi S., Maddox S. J.
