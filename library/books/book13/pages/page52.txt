4 Mean Wind and Turbulence in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer 23as representing the marine atmosphere. Easterly winds on the other hand represent a terrestrial boundary layer. In Fig. 4.1 we have plotted the annual stability distributions for easterly and westerly flows. The figures both reflect the tendency to stable stratifica tion at larger heights and that thermal effects have to be included also for the winds of relevance for wind energy. Next we plot in Fig. 4.2, the annual mean wind profiles from East and West for u100  8, 10, 12, 14, 16 ms1, and for z between 10 and 160 m. From West the internal boundary layer growth is clear in the kinks in the profiles and in agreement with the standard models 5. Most from East but also from West the tendency for the upper part of the profiles to increase more than a logarithmic law is clear and can be modeled to be in accordance with (4.1) to that of (4.5) for climatologic value of N  0.01 s1, yielding LN  2300 m.;Fig. 4.1. Annual stability distribution for u100  8 ms1 from East (terrestrial) and West (marine) boundary layers at z100 and 160 m above terrain. The width of the PDF corresponds to a Bulk Richardson number, RiB with  defined between 80 100 and 100165 m respectively, of about  0.02 for both figures. This corresponds to 100L  1.3 over land and 3.4 over water. Note, RiB (gT)( z)(zuz)2;Fig. 4.2. Profiles of wind from West (left) and East (right hand side), for 10160 m over terrain, see text above for discussion.
