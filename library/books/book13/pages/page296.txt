288 M. Seidel and J. Gowein;The rotor blades have been developed in cooperation with LM Glasfiber with the largest rotor diameter ever designed. The blade structure of the LM 61.5 is optimized such that a low blade weight is achieved, in combination with high static permissible stress and high energy yield. The main, or rotor shaft is supported by two bearings. The first, non locating bearing is a socalled CARBTMbearing, which can handle much higher dislocations compared to a conventional spherical roller bearing. The second, locating bearing is a spherical roller bearing, which protects the gear box from external loads (other than the torque) to a large extent. Thus the double bearings will increase the safe life of the gearbox. The gearbox is a planetary gear with one spur wheel. It is equipped with a refined system for oil filtration and cooling. The oil is filtrated down to 6 m and the cooling system prevents high oil temperatures. Thanks to the double bearing of the main shaft and a robust rotor lock, the gearbox can be disassembled without taking the rotor down. A double fed inducing generator is used, together with an IGBT inverter. Four water cooled inverters are used with a redundant combination of every pair of two modules. This means, that on failure of one module (or pair), the turbine can still operate at reduced power (up to 3 MVA). The GFRP nacelle panel and spinner consist of several parts and are pro tected by a sophisticated lightning protection system. The simulations of the 5M are extensively compared with measurements. Results so far show a very good agreement between the simulations with Flex 5 and the measurements (see Fig. 53.2).
