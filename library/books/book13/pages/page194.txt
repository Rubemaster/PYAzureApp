F. Bottcher, J. Peinke, D. Kleinhans, and R. Friedrich;Summary. A frequent challenge for wind energy applications is to grasp the im pacts of turbulent wind speeds properly. Here we present a general new approach to analyze time series  interpreted as a realization of complex dynamical systems  which are spoiled by the simultaneous presence of dynamical noise and measurement noise. It is shown that such noise implications can be quantified solely on the basis of measured times series.;A fundamental problem in wind energy production is a proper estimation of the wind turbinespecific power curve, i.e., the functional relation between the (averaged) wind speed u(t) and the corresponding (averaged) power output P(t) u(t)  P(u(t)). On the basis of this relation and the expected annual wind speed distribution at a specific location the annual energy production (AEP) is estimated.;The main problem of a proper determination of the power curve (officiallyregularized in IEC 6140012) is its nonlinearity in combination with the tur bulent wind field. It is well known that to characterize a fluctuating nonlinear quantity higher order moments are generally needed to be considered. In view of the determination of a proper power curve this means that the association of an averaged power to an averaged wind speed is not unique but will depend at least on the intensity of fluctuations. To circumvent this difficulty it was suggested to expand the power curve into a Taylor series (e.g., 1,2);u2  v2  O(v3) , (32.1)where the notation u(t)  V  v(t) (with V  u(t) and v(t)  0) for the instantaneous wind speed is used. Assuming that the fluctuations v(t) are
