The steep slopes of trip wires applicated in wind tunnel experiments could not be modelled. The minimum length l obtained with the used grid generator is five times the modelled obstacle height h.;The second CFDmodel keeps the original airfoil contour and attemptsto represent the obstacle by adding a turbulent source to the turbulent kinetic energy equation. For this purpose the model from Johansen, Srensen, Hansen 7 firstly proposed by Hansen 8 was adapted. The two dimensional model originally developed in order to simulate vortex generators is used to compare the effects of different obstacle types. The additional kinetic energy is written as;2  h  l (35.1)with the local flow speed U, the height h and the length l of the discrete roughness in crosssection. c1 is an empirical constant including the roughness aerodynamical characteristic regarding the turbulence. The additional kinetic energy is applied at the location of the discrete roughness in an area of 2h2h.;The simulations are calculated for Re  6.6 M and Ma  0.15.;Figure 35.2 depicts measured and simulated lift coefficients (cl) against angle of attack. The simulation with the modified airfoil contour with an obstacle height of 0.41.0 mm results in lower cl as the simulation with the turbulence source for a parameter c1 between 0.25 and 1.;(cd). The measured cd exceed the simulation by 0.002 (clean airfoil) to 0.004 (trip wire). The magnitude of the simulated cd at low angles of attack has been confirmed by xfoil calculations. The difference is perhaps caused by an increased experimental turbulence intensity due to nitrogen injection for cooling purposes. In spite of this discrepancy Fig. 35.3 shows a similar trend in both simulation results and measured values referring to the discrete roughness.
