250 V.L. Okulov and J.N. Srensen;(46.1)where s  0 N  1 is the subharmonic wave number E  0.5772. . . is the Euler constant and the psifunction () takes values such as (12)  0.0395. . ., (13)  1.6818. . ., (23)  1.6320. . . (see, e.g. 1). The last term of BA in (46.1) describes the influence of the assigned velocity field due to root vorticity and the hub of the rotor. Three important exam ples of the central axisymmetrical helical vortices have been considered with R (stepshape), L (Gaussian) and S (hattype) axial vorticity distribution corresponding to Rankine, Lamb and Scully vortices at    4. For those types of assigned flow field the BAterm takes form
