Fig. 29.1. Bassens wind farm layout showing position of metmast and three turbines selected for wind farm model assessment. Free metmast sector between 203 and 15;1 N (P  meas,i  P  mod,i)2, respectively. Data were selected for wind directions for which the metmast was receiving free inflow (see Fig. 29.1) enabling study of three different characteristic tur bines. Turbine 1 experiences the lowest wake effect, while turbine 21 observes wakes from every direction and turbine 25 for some cases is unaffected and whitstands the greatest amount of wakes for wind from SW. In average the wind farm model shows very good agreement with the averaged measured data. As expected, turbines affected by wake during a greater amount of time show higher mean error (see Figs. 29.2 and 29.3). Moreover it can be observed that Ainslie model performs better than Jensen model. However, a tendency to underpredict power for low and overpredict for high wind speeds shows a need in calibration of the thrust coefficient. The uncertainty for both models is high, especially for low wind speeds, and almost no difference is observed between them. It is to remark that the RMSE presents a dependency with respect to the inflow wind speed and that great part of this uncertainty is related to fluctuations of wind speed and power at each turbine, i.e., to power curve estimation.
