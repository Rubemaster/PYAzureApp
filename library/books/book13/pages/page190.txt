A complex behaviour is observed by the dynamics response on sudden changes of wind velocity. The dots are instantaneous measured data and the solid line is the average power output L(u)around u, i.e. small turbulent intensities ti  uu. It is known that the wind fluctuation distribution presents an anomalous statistics around the mean value 1, therefore this is again limited. As an improvement, this article reports that the dynamical behaviour of the power output of a WEC, which acts as an attractor, can be described by a simple function of relaxation and noise. We have shown that those two parts describe the power curve properly if they are calculated from stationary wind measurements. This analysis is very usefull to describe power curve characteristics for situation with increased turbulent intensities and it can be easily applied to measured data.
