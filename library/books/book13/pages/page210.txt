A height of 0 means the clean airfoil, a height of 0.4 and 0.6 mm refers to zigzag tape of this height and a height of 1.0 mm refers to the trip wire. Despite a variation due to the range in Mach and Reynolds number and the different type of obstacles the liftdrag ratio clearly exhibits a decreasing trend with the obstacle height. This trend is reproduced by the simulation (Re  6.6 M, Ma  0.15) with a contour variation, forming an obstacle of 0.01.0 mm of height. Due to an overestimation of cl and an underestimation of cd the calculated liftdrag ratio is generally too large. The effect of the modelled additional turbulence source is not shown as the variation of liftdrag ratio is below 1. Figure 35.5 shows the transition behaviour at an angle of attack   6 corresponding to a lift coefficient of cl  1 (design). The effect of the model using a contour varia tion is seen as a peak. The friction coefficient (cf) near the peak is decreased. The effect of the additional turbulence source changes the cfcurve very little. The effect on the transition location is negligible due to earlier natural tran sition. Further simulations with other locations of the discrete roughness are reasonable.;A discrete roughness has been modelled with an obstacle as part of the airfoil contour as well as with an additional turbulence source. The simulation results have been compared with measurement data of the airfoil DU97300mod.
