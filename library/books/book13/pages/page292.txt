284 H. Th. Beier et al.;A fracture criterion (or limiting criterion) can be defined by fracture mechan ics, for civil engineering structures, e.g. with DASt 009 10 which is based on R6method 11, by plastic collapse loads or deformation limits for ductile materials. Application of other criteria is possible.;52.2.5 Endurance Limit with Local Stress Approach;An alternative approach which replaces Sects. 52.2.252.2.4 is the local stress approach. The approach in the form of Olivier 14 is based on one FAT class for all welds subjected to loads perpendicular to the weld direction. The method is established in IIWrecommendations 15. The corresponding Wohlercurve for an aswelded situation is given in 15 with FAT225 and an exponent m  3.;52.3.1 Trussjoint with Precut Gusset Plates (PCGPjoint);In order to obtain the fatigue resistance of the PCGPjoint the modern concept introduced in Sects. 52.2.152.2.4 has been used 12 a minimised number of 15 tests have been performed on two types of normal scale specimens (a) joints with sharp edges (r  2 mm) and (b) with radii (r  10 mm) at the free gap. The fatigue lives of these specimens have been calculated by the proposed concept. The Wohlercurves of the tests and the calculations showed very good agreement, see Fig. 52.3 for the PCGPjointtype with radii at the free gap (test series R2).;The verified calculationmodel has then been used to perform an extensiveparameter study to obtain the fatigue resistance of PCGPjoints typically used in structural steelwork. As a result the PCGPjoints with radii at the free gap can be classified in FAT 36 according to EC3 part 1 16. The joint version with the sharp edges can not be classified in a FATclass and can therefore not be used in situations with cyclic loading.;52.3.2 Stiffener of the Great Wind Energy Converter GROWIAN
