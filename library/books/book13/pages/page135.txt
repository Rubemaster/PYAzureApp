S. Barth, F. Bottcher and J. Peinke;Summary. We introduce a model that interprets atmospheric increment statistics as a large scale mixture of different subsets of turbulence with statistics known from laboratory experiments. When mixing is weak the same statistics as for homogenous turbulence is recovered while for strong mixing robust intermittency is obtained.;In this paper we focus on the scale dependent statistics of increments u  U(t  )  U(t) of atmospheric velocities U(t), measured at different on and offshore locations and compare them to statistics of homogenous, isotropic and stationary turbulence as realized in laboratory experiments. For homogenous, isotropic and stationary turbulence the statistical moments of velocity increments, the socalled structure functions have been intensively studied cf. 1. Their functional dependence on the scale  is described by a variety of multifractal models. Besides the analysis of structure functions, probability density functions (PDFs) of the increments are often considered.;The atmospheric PDFs we examine here differ from those of common turbulent laboratory flows where  with decreasing scale   a change of shape of the PDFs is observed (e.g. 2). For large scales the laboratory distribu tions are Gaussian while for small scales they are found to be intermittent. The atmospheric PDFs however change their shape only for the smallest scales and then stay intermittent and nonGaussian for a broad range of scales, because the outer range is usually unknown or nor accessible. Although the decay of the tails indicates that distributions should approach Gaussian ones (as for isotropic turbulence) they show a rather robust exponentiallike decay. The challenge is to describe and to explain the measured fattailed distributions and the corresponding nonconvergence to Gaussian statistics. Large incre ment values in the tails directly correspond to an increased probability (risk) to observe large and very large events (gusts).
