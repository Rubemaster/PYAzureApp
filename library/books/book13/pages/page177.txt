v (28.1)with the standard deviation  of the wind speed and the mean value v.;The numeric error is related to the shape of the ideal power curve. Henceto quantify the numeric error the power curve in homogeneous flow has to be known. In general this information is not available, therefore it is impossible to isolate the numeric error. To eliminate the effects due to turbulence on the power curve, we need to find a method covering the WTs and anemometers response and the numeric error at the same time. Within a wind speed bin the power varies depending on the turbulence intensity 5. Albers et al. have shown that the mean power in a bin can be described as;v (28.2)with P(v) mean measured power in a bin P (v) theoretical power at average wind speed v in a bin v standard deviation of the averaged wind speed v.;From (28.2) it can be seen that the measured power in a bin contains twocomponents, the theoretical power output and a second term, which is related to the second derivative of the power curve and the turbulence. The second term will be negative when the power curve is bent to the right and positive when the power curve is bent to the left. Hence with increasing turbulence intensity the power output will be underestimated at rated wind speed and overestimated near cutin wind speed (Fig. 28.1). The unknown factors of (28.2) are the ideal power curve at zero turbulence and its second derivative.
