AOA is a 2D concept. For a rotating blade, it can be approached as an AOA in a crosssection. In order to have a uniform inflow in each crosssection, it is then selected in the azimuthal direction (i.e. at constant radius). The selected crosssection is bended in large scale but in small scale can be considered as a plane.;To determine the AOA, we need to do some preliminary work. First,the blade is divided into a few crosssections (for example N10 sections) where the blade local force is known. Second, a control point should be cho sen where the velocity can be read. Theoretically, this control point can be chosen everywhere in the crosssection. In our calculation, the bound circu lation around an airfoil section is considered to be a point vortex. Therefore the point should not be too close to the airfoil due to the singularity of point vortex. For convenience, it is chosen in front of the airfoil section. Since the induced velocity varies across the rotor plane, the control point should be chosen in the rotor plane. The features of the choice can be found in Fig. 37.1.
