Summary. Dynamic Stall is a flow phenomenon which occurs on helicopter rotor blades during forward flight mainly on the retreating side of the rotor disc. This phenomenon limits the speed of the helicopter and its manoeuvrability. Strong excursions in drag and pitching moment are typical unfavourable characteristics of the Dynamic Stall process. However compared to the static polar the lift is considerably increased. Looking more into the flow details it is obvious that a strong concentrated vortex, the Dynamic Stall Vortex, is created during the upstroke motion of the rotor blade starting very close to the blade leading edge. This vortex is growing very fast, is set into motion along the blade upper surface until it lifts off the surface to be shed into the wake. The process of vortex lift off from the surface leads to the excursions in forces and moment mentioned above.;The Dynamic Stall phenomenon does also occur on blades of stall as well as oncommonly used pitchregulated wind turbines under yawing conditions as well as during gust loads. For any modern wind turbine type Dynamic Stall comes out to be a severe problem.;Stall process are discussed in some detail. Some possibilities are also pointed out to favourably influence dynamic stall by either static or dynamic flow control devices.;The flow is strongly timedependent in particular during the creation,movement and shedding of the Dynamic Stall Vortex. These rapid flow variations have to be addressed in both numerical as well as experimental investigations. Numerical codes 3, have to be based on the full equations, i.e. the NavierStokes equations to solve these problems by taking into ac count a suitable turbulence model, i.e. 8.
