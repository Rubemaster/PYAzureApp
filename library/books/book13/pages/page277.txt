Figure 49.1 presents results for a 100 mmdiameter disc made of mesh 6 at different downstream locations. The nearwake area, characterized by an an nular shear layer and an annular turbulence intensity distribution, is well defined and ends up at xD  4, where the two shear layers start collapsing. The deduced axial flow induction factor is a  0.18. The far wake starts at xD  9, from where the mean velocity and turbulence intensity profiles are selfsimilar. At xD  9, the turbulence intensity is locally three times higher than the freestream turbulence intensity Iu0.;Tests on the influence of the porosity level on the velocity and turbulencedistributions show that one can totally control the velocity deficit, and so the sheargenerated turbulence, using the appropriate mesh porosity level. Tests on the mesh cell size for a fixed porosity level (65) illustrate that when the ratio between the mesh cell size and the disc diameter is smaller than 0.05, the velocity distribution is independent of the mesh. If this ratio is respected, it is also independent of the disc size.;A wind farm was built with 9 squarearranged porous discs made of mesh 6 mounted on masts (Fig. 49.2). The masts spacing is x  y  3D. Figure 49.3 shows the mean velocity distributions 3D downstream of the first, the second and the third row of porous discs. The black circle shows the disc circumference. Classical features of the wind turbine wakes are found 4. As expected, the velocity deficit is located lower than the disc centre, due to the ground effect. The velocity deficit increases between the first and the second row, but stays constant between the second and the third one, although the wake extend is still growing. Figure 49.4 shows the turbulence intensity dis tributions at the same locations. It is worth to notice that, after three rows, the turbulence intensity can locally reach 26, due to the combination of the
