B. Stoevesandt, J. Peinke, A. Shishkin and C. Wagner;Reduction of the weight of wind turbine blades is of large interest to manufac turers. To do so without losing the necessary stability, blade loads caused by dynamic stall effects have been a major task in aerodynamic research during the last years 1.;The aim of the project is to calculate lift and drag caused by the effect ofdynamic stall as they arise in turbulent wind fields. This is done by means of wind tunnel measurements and numerical flow simulations. For the flow simulation a spectralhp code has been chosen to achieve high accuracy 2. In order to simulate the dynamic stall the boundary conditions have to be flexible. Currently the main focus of the works lies on reliability tests of the numerical code.;Due to the increasing size of wind turbine airfoils their weight is becoming an increasing problem. The aim of highest efficiency, best lift at a minimum of cost and weight seems to be an unsolvable contradiction. One of the problems in the design of airfoils is, that mechanical stability investigations are based on estimations of the lift caused by dynamic stall.;Dynamic stall is induced by an unsteady inflow on the airfoil. For windturbines a main factor is gusty inflow on the profile causing rapid changes of wind speed and direction. Thus at a tip with a tip speed of 80 m s1 a change of wind speed of 8 m s1 would even cause an inflow deviance of 5.7. Figure 44.1 illustrates that these occurrences are of relevant order.;Simulating turbulence is difficult with traditional CFD approaches sincethese methods are stabilized using numerical dissipation. In contrast the nu merical dissipation of spectralhpelement methods is comparably low. The aim of the project is to investigate the flow separation at the profile in 3D and to analyse the extreme loads on the airfoil caused by turbulence.
