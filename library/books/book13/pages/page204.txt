Measurements were conducted with an eightchannel power quality analyzer. Figure 34.2 shows a failuretimecircle with the measured tripping events of the eight WECs over a time span of 18 months. With this longterm failure monitoring a methodical evaluation of the failure sources was possible and enabled the operator to plan countermeasures. Our investigations deal with
