J. Bergers, H. Huhn and R. Puthli;Summary. This article presents a new research project. The aim of this project is to evaluate the individual problems concerning stability and durability of towers of offshore wind energy converters and to develop new solutions. This includes the investigation of the influence of steel grade and wall thickness, the assessment of the remaining life and geometrical form of the connection. Another important aspect is the adjustment of the existing fatigue design concept to the special requirements of offshore wind energy converters.;In the context of the exploiting alternative energies, many offshore wind parks are planned in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and Irish Sea. Aggravated conditions such as large water depths, increasing heights of towers and hubs, as well as other environmental conditions require new solutions concerning the stability and the durability of offshore wind energy converters (OWEC).;Therefore the Forschungsvereinigung Stahlanwendung e.V., sponsors a new;Therefore the Forschungsvereinigung Stahlanwendung e.V., sponsors a newresearch project 1. The University of Karlsruhe as project leader is fortu nate to have the involvement of competent partners. The Germanische Lloyd Windenergie GmbH as an accepted certification authority for the construc tion of OWEC takes care of corrosion problems. As a specialist in questions of durability the University of Braunschweig also participates in the project. The IMS Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH is a leading engineering company in the range of offshore constructions and is responsible for the specification of the struc ture and the numerical investigation. Furthermore, experts of wind energy and the steel industry also take part in the research project. The Research Centre for Steel, Timber and Masonry is mainly responsible for performing further finiteelement analyses, determination of the most appropriate method of testing and the following fatigue investigation.
