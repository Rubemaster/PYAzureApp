Fig. 43.6. Static torque coefficient on the optimised rotoris found to be equal to 0.242, whereas e  0. Even if it remains very insta ble, the torque coefficient is notably raised compared with the conventional Savonius rotor 4, with a general increasing of about 20.;In this preliminary work, the influence of the inclination angle  of the paddles has been studied for only two values of the wind direction   90 and   45, that allows to determine an optimal value of the inclination angle   55. Optimum values of the overlaps giving highest values of the torque, have been systematically researched, leading to ed  0.242 and e  0. The static torque is calculated as in Sect. 43.4.1. (Fig. 43.7). An example of the pressure contours is presented in Fig. 43.8. The result is encouraging, since the new rotor induces maximal values of the static torque largely higher than those obtained on the conventional rotor, even if it also introduces low and negative values of this torque, with a great angular variation. Nevertheless, the mean value of the torque is increased Cm  0.48, i.e. 60 more than for the conventional rotor.
