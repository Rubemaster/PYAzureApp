The Savonius rotor is made from two vertical halfcylinders running around a vertical axis (Figs. 43.1, 43.2). A modified rotor (Fig. 43.3) is also studied, which is just an extrapolation of the Savonius rotor, using three geometrical parameters the main overlap e, the secondary overlap e, and the angle  between the paddles. In the following, we name conventional Savonius rotor the one for which the geometrical parameters e and e are, respectively, equal to d6 and 0. The characteristic curves of such a rotor (values of the power coefficient Cp and of the torque coefficient Cm towards the speed ratio ) are presented in Fig. 43.4.
