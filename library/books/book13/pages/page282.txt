In Fig. 50.2 (left) can be noticed three hub vortices, twisted one over each other and spinning in opposite direction to the blades as it can be seen also experimentally 2. Several vortical structures are developing behind the turbine starting from the mast. Point 9 is positioned in the tip vortex (xD  0 yD  0.14 zD  0.49) and it shows a spectrum (Fig. 50.2 (right)) which is dominated by the blade passage frequency.;Several monitoring points are placed in the domain. Y 1(xD  2 yD  2.5 zD  1.3) is placed at the tip of the rotor and Y 6(xD  2 yD  3.75 zD  1.3) behind the turbine. Z1(xD  2 yD  2.5 zD  0.1) and Z6(xD  6.5 yD  2.5 zD  0.1) are placed at the foot of the mast and lateral to the turbine respectively. The acoustic density fluctuation  decreases in amplitude with the distance from the rotor. The spectra of acoustic density fluctuation in Fig. 50.3 show that in the near field, the fre quency range is broader and shrinks towards smaller values with the distance from the rotor. Except the blade passage frequency f  1 and its harmonics, the spectra have a peak in the high frequency part (Fig. 50.3). This peak is shifted towards smaller values when the distance from the wind turbine is in creased. This is an expected behavior and is caused by the production of the turbulence originating in the shear near the rotor blades which gets dissipated with the distance from its source. Although the instantaneous acoustic density fluctuation field has a similar distribution from blade to blade, some differences can be noticed. This differ ences (Fig. 50.3 (below left)) are caused mainly by the influence of the mast over the flow. As seen in the same figure, the ground reflected waves interact with the propagating waves from the wind turbine, also the waves radiated from each neighboring turbine are interacting with each other.
