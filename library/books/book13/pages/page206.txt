Summary. At inboard and midspan locations of multimegawatt turbines thick airfoils (30) are increasingly used. The design of the nose area often leads to an increased sensitivity to surface roughness. Experimental research on the airfoil DU97W300mod have been carried out including the investigation of discrete rough ness by application of spread and discrete roughnesses at Reynolds numbers up to 10 million. These results are compared to simulations with the CFD code FLOWer. The discrete roughness has been modelled both geometrically and by adding a source of turbulent energy.;The sustainability of wind energy production is considerably affected by electricity production costs per kW h. A reduction of rotor blade costs means in the majority of cases a reduction of masses. Therefore, at inboard and mid span regions of multimegawatt turbines thick airfoils (30) are increasingly used. However, the design of the leading edge area results in an increased sen sitivity to surface roughness 1, 2. Multimegawatt turbines reach Reynolds numbers (Re) from 1  106 to 10  106 (110 M). In order to predict the per formance of an installed turbine blade investigations on the effect of surface roughnesses at these Reynolds numbers are important.;At operating turbines surface roughness is mainly caused by smashedinsects in the nose region of the blade. It is difficult to model this surface structure exactly. In wind tunnel experiments surface roughnesses are rep resented by using sandpaper in the nose region of the airfoil as well as by application of trip wire and zigzag tape. The analyses done so far considered mainly the performance depending on Reynolds numbers and on the surface conditions considered as spread roughness 3,4.
