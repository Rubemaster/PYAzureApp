The total number of node points are then 5.5105, 1.3106, 2.6 106, and 4.4  106. The sensitivity of the Gaussian smearing and the Reynolds number has also been studied. An evaluation method to extract values of the circulation from the wake flow field is developed. When the circulation is evaluated in the wake, an integration is performed around a loop, enclosing the vortex. Each vortex is evaluated in terms of its circulation in a plane perpendicular to the turbine disc. The vortex created at the tip, or at least close to the tip, is evaluated every 30 behind the blade. The root vortex is evaluated in the same manner but since the vortices tend to be smeared out further downstream, because of diffusion, it is more difficult to evaluate the circulation further downstream in this case. The circulation is integrated at a specific value of the vorticity. The sensitivity of the circulation with respect to the grid resolution has been evaluated. The evaluation was performed with three different grid sizes, 64, 80, and 96 node points at each side of the blocks. The solution converges with greater grid size. Some wiggles appear at some distance downstream and can probably be explained by a too few number of grid points when the circulation is integrated and because of increasing smearing of the cores further downstream. When using a finer grid, the vortices become more concentrated and the integration can be performed further downstream without large fluctuations in the result.
