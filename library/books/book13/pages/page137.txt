Fig. 20.2. Symbols represent measured mean velocity distributions (averaged over 10 min) of four different atmospheric data sets. Solid lines are fits according to (20.3);Fig. 20.2. Symbols represent measured mean velocity distributions (averaged over 10 min) of four different atmospheric data sets. Solid lines are fits according to (20.3)p(u) ;(20.3)which is well established in meteorology 3. In Fig. 20.2 it is shown that a Weibull distribution is a good representation of h(u).;Inserting (20.3) and (20.1) into (20.2) the following expression for atmo;Inserting (20.3) and (20.1) into (20.2) the following expression for atmospheric PDFs is obtained;Parameters A and k play a similar role as 0 and 2 in the Castaing distribution. With this approach intermittent atmospheric PDFs can be approximated for any location as long as the mean velocity distribution is known.;In Fig. 20.3 probability density functions of velocity increments are shownfor different scales  (increasing from top to bottom). The left figure corre sponds to a measurement with an ultrasonic anemometer in a nonstationary atmospheric flow. The right figure corresponds to a measurement with a
