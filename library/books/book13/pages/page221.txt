The Tellus rotor is equipped with three LM8.2 blades rotating at   5.0161 rad s1. NavierStokes computa tions were previous carried out for wind speeds of 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17 and 20 m s1 with the EllipSys3D code. For more details about CFD computa tions, the reader is referred to 2. Local force on the blade and local velocity at different positions in the rotor plane are then extracted from the data. In Fig. 37.2, drag and lift coefficients at radial position r  65.7R are obtained
