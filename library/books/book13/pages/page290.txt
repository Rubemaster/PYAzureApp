282 H. Th. Beier et al.;The fatigue tests should give information about the location of the crack initiation and the corresponding number of cycles, the crack growth behaviour, the slope of the Wohlercurve, the scatter of the test results and the FATclass. The information is then used to verify the calculational fatigue resistance. Information about the scatter can be found in the literature. Because the reported scatter takes a great number of different test situations into account, the standard deviation will be generally greater than by the own tests. In this case the literature values should be used for a statistical evaluation.;52.2.2 Crack Initiation with Local Strain Approach
