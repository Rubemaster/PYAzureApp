The results of the model with the variation of the turbulence source exhibit a small dependency of cl and cd on the parameter c1. Separation is not represented sufficiently and the maximum lift coefficient (cmax;small dependency of cl and cd on the obstacle height. The results of the model with the variation of the turbulence source exhibit a small dependency of cl and cd on the parameter c1. Separation is not represented sufficiently and the maximum lift coefficient (cmaxl ) is not correctly predicted. This effect;l ) is not correctly predicted. This effectis considered as a shortcoming of the kturbulence model.
