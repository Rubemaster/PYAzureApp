Some popular techniques used in simulations of turbulent flows are presented and discussed. It is shown how the (k, ) turbulence model and two different dynamic subgrid scale models perform in Reynoldsaveraged NavierStokes simulations (RANS) and LargeEddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent chan nel flow, respectively. Besides, some drawbacks of the eddy viscosity concept which is the basis for most turbulence models are discussed.;Phenomenologically most flows can be categorized into the laminar and the turbulent flow regime. Any disturbance, which is damped by molecular dis sipation in a laminar flow, grows to form a turbulent, chaoticlike, time dependent, threedimensional flow field, if the relative impact of the molecular dissipation is reduced. The latter is expressed by an increase of the Reynolds number Re  u(l) ( represent the kinematic viscosity, l and u the length and velocity scales of the flow). Turbulent flows are characterized by fluctu ations on a wide range of scales the size of which decrease with increasing Reynolds numbers. In order to properly resolve all scales in a socalled direct numerical simulation (DNS) one has to specify extremely fine grids, resulting in unaffordable computing times for high Reynolds number flows. To over come this, researchers developed turbulence models, which approximate the effect of smaller scales. This is necessary since most environmental or techni cal relevant turbulent flows are characterized by very high Reynolds numbers. Hence, turbulence modelling is one of the key problems in numerical flow simulation.
