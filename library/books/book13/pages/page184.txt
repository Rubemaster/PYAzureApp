T. Weidinger, A. Kiss, A.Z. Gyongyosi, K. Krassovan and B. Papp;With the development of low cutin wind speed turbines for continental climatological conditions, wind power has become an economical source of energy in Hungary. The first high power wind turbine was implemented at the end of 2000 (Inota, Balaton Highlands 250 kW). Currently nine wind tur bines are working at a total power of about 7 MW. By the end of the decade 3.6 of the total domestic electric energy production (about 1,600 GW h) is planned to be covered by renewable energy.;Windenergy research in Hungary has been carried out for more thanhalf a century 1. Wind maps for the different periods have been prepared 24, detailed statistical analysis of the wind data has been done 5 and the Hungarian pages for the European Wind Atlas have been prepared 6,7. Wind energy maps have been calculated for different levels based on the WAsP model 8 and numerical model results 9.;The average wind speed in Hungary is between 2 and 4 m s1. The maximum occurs in spring, the minimum in late summer or early fall. Several wind maps of Hungary have similar structure, but in some cases large deviations (0.20.4 m s1) are present in the annual means between maps for different periods or maps based on various interpolation formulae. This feature is demonstrated on two different wind maps for the period from 1997 to 2003 (Fig. 30.1).
