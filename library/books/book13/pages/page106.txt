Table 14.1. Examples for an assessment of extreme wind conditions;loadsfor the turbulence classes A and C. Again measured turbulence intensities at the FINO1 platform have been plotted for comparison. The values have been collected during January, July and December 2004 at the 100 m level.;The intensities in the definition of turbulence class C as well as turbulenceclass A seem to be an upper limit for the measured values. As a rough picture intensities are scattered around an average value of 58 for wind speeds above 8 m s1, which is only half the value as given by class C. In contrast to the turbulence class model the lowest measured values can be found for wind speeds in between 8 and 10 m s1 and they are slightly increasing for higher wind speeds, probably because of larger wave heights.;A thorough analysis of the FINO1 data will be carried out in order toverify extreme load conditions for the offshore case. In Table 14.1 examples for the data analysis and the connected extreme wind parameter are given.
