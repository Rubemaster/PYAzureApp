Up to now, over 60,000 reports on maintenance and repair have beensubmitted to ISET. Standardized evaluations are published in the Wind Energy Report 1, which is updated annually.;Usually, WTs are designed to operate for a period of 20 years. But, no final statement can be made yet concerning the actual life expectancy of mod ern WTs as, until now, no operational experience of such period is available. Changes in reliability with increasing operational age can, however, provide indications of the expected lifetime and the amount of upkeep required. Relia bility can be expressed by the number of failures per unit of time, i.e. Failure Rate. In the following, the failure rates of WTs depending on their opera tional age will be depicted (Fig. 62.1).;It is clear that the failure rates of the WTs now installed, have almostcontinually declined in the first operational years. This is true for the older turbines under 500 kW and for the 500600 kW class. However, the group of megawatt WTs show a significantly higher failure rate, which also declines by increasing age. But, including now more and more megawatt WT models of the newest generation, the failure rate in the first year of operation is being reduced.;The principal development of failure rates is well known in other technicalareas. Early failures often mark the beginning of operation. This phase is generally followed by a longer period of random failures, before the failure rate through wear and damage accumulation (wearout failures) increases with operational age.
