Table 51.1 also offers the comparison for turbulence intensity (TI) at the test site, which was carried out for WAsP Engineering 2.0 and Fluent 6.2.;As it is seen, both models obtained similar results when trying to extrapolate TI between masts. This result is also observed through the average absolute error 36.79 for WAsP Engineering and 35.86 for Fluent.;The analysis indicates that the nonlinear solver Fluent 6.2 can simulate more accurately wind speed field for complex terrain than other wind flow models. Nevertheless, no conclusion could be extracted so far about which model ex plains better turbulence intensity.;Future works using CFD Fluent 6.2 will focus on testing more sophisticated turbulence models as well as on improving the distribution of surface roughness. Turbulence validation will also be done by means of more advanced wind sensors such as Lidar. On the other hand, grid independence studies will be carried out to reduce computing time.;1.
