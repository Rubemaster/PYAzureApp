46 E. Bibor and C. Masson;Fig. 8.3. (a) Attachment unit on the nacelle (b) Influence of the attachment unitpositions, U1 and U2, distant of 50 cm, have been analysed (Fig. 8.3b). The influence of the Ubeam is significant, and can explain in part the differences observed between the numerical and experimental correlations.;Three main conclusions were drawn from experimental and numerical analysis. First, using the correlation provided by the manufacturer for any type of terrain can lead to important error. The second conclusion is that the use of a general correlation for all the valid sectors is not a bad practice. Finally, it has been numerically proven that for this WT, the attachment unit of the nacelle anemometer is an important cause of the flow perturbation.
