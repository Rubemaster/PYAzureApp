44 Numerical Simulation of Dynamic Stall using Spectralhp Method 243the ptype expansion refers to the order of the polynomial expansion of the function and to the convergence by selecting a sufficient polynomial order. The polynomials can be of nodal type such as Lagrange polynomials or modal type like Jacobi polynomials.;For the numerical simulation we use the NekTar code,1 which was originally developed by Sherwin, Karniadakis, Warburton et al. It is a scientific code consisting of a 2D and a 3D direct numerical simulation (DNS) solver as well as a 3DFourier code including an large eddy simulation (LES) solver. The general option for variable boundary conditions implemented enables the simulation of turbulence . Figure 44.3 shows a calculation of the flow around an airfoil in 2D.;1 The DNSNekTarCodes can be obtained from httpwww.ae.ic.ac.ukstaffsherwinnektardownloads
