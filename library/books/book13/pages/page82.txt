Kutta time integration scheme are applied to the system (10.2), see 1. The scheme is theoretically second order accurate in space and time (on orthogonal grids) and it also needs to be stabilized by the artificial viscosity term of fourth order to remove a spurious oscillations from the flowfield generated by the use of central differences for space discretization.;1) noslip wall modelling 15010016 mesh cells, horizontally uniform andexponentially distributed in the zaxis direction, zmin  4.6 m.;2) wall function modelling 150  100  10 mesh cells, horizontally uniformand exponentially distributed in the vertical direction, zmin  28.3 m.;The other parameters are the mean free stream velocity U  10 ms1, the characteristic wallnormal domain dimension L  1, 000 m and the corre sponding Reynolds number Re  U  L  6, 7  108, the roughness pa rameter z0  1 m and the power law exponent 0.3 and the friction velocity u  0.33 ms1 are used for the inlet velocity profile, see 2, 3.
