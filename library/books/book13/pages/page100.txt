Fig. 13.5. The pdf of recurrent times estimated for various velocity thresholds (0.6, 1, 1.5 and 2 m s1) respectively, from bottom to top. A straight line of slope 1 is shown for comparison with the 2 m s1 threshold curve;  ds  1 13. Return times are thus very intermittent, with a hyperbolic pdf tail associated to divergence of moments of order   1. This has been tested on experimental data Figure 13.5 shows four dif ferent pdfs in loglog plot, estimated for increasing thresholds from 0.6 to 2 m s1 the hyperbolic tail is visible, with a slope decreasing with increasing
