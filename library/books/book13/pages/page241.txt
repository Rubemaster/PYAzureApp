Fig. 41.2. Upper figure Photography of flow separation effects on EU 56 rotor blade, Lower figure 3D Simulation Surface streamlines on suction sideseparated flow can be pointed out by comparing the radial velocity field on the left side to the absolute velocity field on the right side. This is representative for all nearhubprofiles that are affected by flow separation.;Fig. 41.3. 3D Simulation, Velocity and Vector field for r  3.75 m, left figure Radial velocity component, right figure Velocity field;The evaluation of the airflow at different profiles along the rotor blade show an expanding and intensifying radial flow with growing rotorradii. Beginning at the hub, radial velocities accelerate and remain at 13 m s1 until the rotor ratio of rR  28, where they start to decelerate. At rR  30 all radial flows have been redirected to the trailing edge (see Fig. 41.4). In Fig. 41.2 the air flow separates at cylindric root profiles characteristi cally. Two eddies in lee develop differently with growing radius. The analysis of this velocity distribution and those for larger radii indicate a helical move ment of the vortex centers.
