Fig. 9.3. Mean concentration profiles for various interobstacle gap widthcase concentration peaks are distinctly moving towards the flow axis and for the distances x1B  0.75 maximum values of mean concentration are in the centreline of the wake. The region of higher CO2 concentration is noticeable in the whole interobstacle gap. Mean concentration profiles for various interobstacle gaps and for the same position of x1B  1 behind the upstream cylinder are presented in the Fig. 9.3. As one can notice, in the case of SB  2 and SB  6 maximum values of mean concentration are outside of the gap region, while for the gap width SB  4 maximum value of mean concentration is in the centreline of the wake. Computational profiles of the mean velocity components and numerical distribution of turbulence energy for the same cross section (x1B  1) were used to find explanation. It was revealed that velocity distributions are similar so the question arises why the concentration profiles are different. To find an explanation the results of computational modelling of velocity field performed by Gnatowska  Jarza 1 have been used. The numerical
