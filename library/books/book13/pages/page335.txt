Fig. 61.2. Influence on power, standard deviation of flapwise bending moment and mean tilt moment for Scenario S2only occur at low to moderate wind speeds. Furthermore the atmospheric con ditions need to be stable, which results in relatively low turbulence intensities, compared to the unstable normalconditions. Finally, the overall time share at which these events take place is probably small compared to the turbines life time.;1.
