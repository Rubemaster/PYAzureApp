30 Uncertainty of Wind Energy Estimation 169at Kekesteto (9) was only 3.42 m s1, and at Siofok (5) 3.04 m s1 but con trarily in Papa (4) it was significantly larger (2.93 m s1) than the long term average (see Table 30.1 for long term averages of each station).;Two common methods for the estimation of wind profile include (1) the MoninObukhov similarity theory and (2) the power law profile approx imation. The similarity theory, however, has large error above the surface layer 10.;The scope of this section is the analysis of the powerlaw estimation. Theindependent variables of the power law wind profile formula are the wind speed (Ur) of the reference level (zr) and the stability dependent exponent (p). The numerical value of the exponent is 17 over homogeneous terrain with short vegetation, which is the most common first guess. Dependence on stability (e.g., Pasquill categories) can be assumed through the daily variation of the exponent p. In the daytime convective surface layer its value ranges between 0.07 and 0.1, while by extreme stable stratification p  0.30.5 is suggested.;In addition, sensitivity for the wind energy (which is proportional to thecube of wind speed) is three times larger! An error of p  0.1 results in a 20 error at 80 m in the wind speed and 60 in the wind energy! In case of special tower measurements for energy estimation purpose (usually at 10 and 40 m in Hungary) the profile fitting can be done with higher accuracy (as z0 is higher).;Extensive windenergy measurements were initiated in 2001 in Hungary. Let us consider the wind statistics for the period 20012003. Year 2001 was especially windy, while year 2003 was calm in Hungary and in the whole Carpathian Basin. The average at Siofok (5) for example in 2001 and 2003 was 3.31 and 2.27 m s1, respectively. Note that in the data series for Budapest (7) no such significant variability was found, perhaps due to the urban effects.;(station Szentkiralyszabadja, 10) by extrapolating the wind speed in the interval Ur  0.5 m s1 for each observation. This continuous data set could be extrapolated smoothly with the power law wind profile to the upper levels.
