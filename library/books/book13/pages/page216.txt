202 W. Geissler et al.as well as experimental tools. From this knowledge base together with former investigations on this subject possibilities are explored to favourably control Dynamic Stall. Figure 36.3 displays lift, drag and pitching moment hysteresis loops as measured from integrated signals of 45 miniature pressure sensors arranged at midspan of the blade model. In the plots the force and moment data of all measured 160 consecutive cycles are simply plotted on top of each other. Two sets of data are included;1. Measurements with straight wind tunnel walls (grey curves) 2. Measurements with steady wind tunnel wall adaptation at mean incidence (black curves).;It is observed that a shift of the lift curve (left upper Fig. 36.3) occurs due to wind tunnel wall interference effects. The results with wind tunnel wall correction do better fit to the numerical curves indicated in the plots as well (dashed curves).;Fig. 36.3.
