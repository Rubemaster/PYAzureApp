The acoustical field behind a complete three dimensional wind turbine is con sidered numerically. Noise generated by the spatial velocity variation, force exerted by the blade on the fluid, and blade acceleration is taken into ac count. The sources are extracted from a detailed, instantaneous flow field which is computed using Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The propagation of the sound is calculated involving an acoustic analogy developed by Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings. It is found that the near field is dominated by the blade passage frequency. The results, also include ground effects (sound wave reflections) and the acoustical influence of a neighboring turbine.;A very popular approach for aeroacoustic computations nowadays is a hybrid method comprising two steps a flow solution is providing the noise sources, and then the acoustic waves generated by the noise sources are transported through the whole computational domain 1. In this paper, an LES solu tion of an incompressible flow is used to extract the noise sources, and the FfowcsWilliams and Hawkings acoustic analogy is used to compute the noise propagation.;A three blade complete wind turbine, rotating with the angular speed of 60rpm in a wind of 10ms is considered. The geometry is described in Fig. 50.1.
