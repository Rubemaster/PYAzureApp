Fig. 43.7. Torque on the optimised rotor (  90   45 ed  0.242 e  0);The flow around few conventional Savonius rotors has been modellised us ing the CFD code Fluent v6.0. A geometry of an optimised rotor has been proposed. Solutions have been presented to invent a new rotor, with higher performances, by acting on the overlaps of the paddles and on their relative inclination. This work must be continued, aiming a simultaneously research of the optimum values of these geometrical parameters.;1. Wilson RE, Lissaman PBS. (1974) Applied Aerodynamics of wind power machines.
