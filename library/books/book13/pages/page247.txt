Wind turbines are dimensioned for a nominal running point, i.e. for a given wind velocity. In most cases, principally because of their higher efficiency, two or threebladed fast running wind turbines are preferred 1.;Although it has undeniably high performances, this type of windpoweredengine is not necessarily the one which enables the extraction of the maximal energy from a wind site. Using a special method, namely the L criterion, Menet et al. 2 have shown that a slowrunning vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT), such as the Savonius rotor 3, can extract more energy than fast running wind machines.;This idea seems to be in contradiction to the general literature in the fieldthe Savonius rotors have an aerodynamic behaviour where the characteristics of a drag device dominate, which clearly induces a low efficiency. In fact, using the same intercepted front width of wind L and the same value  of the maximal mechanical stress on the paddles or the blades, the reference 2 clearly indicates that the delivered power of a Savonius rotor is superior to the one of any fastrunning horizontal axis wind turbine. Besides, because of its high starting torque, a Savonius rotor can theoretically produce energy at low wind velocities, and because of its low angular velocity, it can deliver electricity under high wind velocities, when fast running wind turbines must generally be stopped 1,4.;The main disadvantage of the Savonius rotor is the great instability ofthe mechanical torque because the flow inside the rotor is nonstationary. Nevertheless, the advantages of such a wind turbine are numerous 4. For a few years, many studies have led to raise performances of these machines 57. Here is the purpose of our contribution to the study.
