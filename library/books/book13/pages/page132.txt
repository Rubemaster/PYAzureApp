112 G.C. Larsen and K.S. Hansen;The basic idea behind the model is, in analogy with Cartwright  Longuet Higgens, to derive an asymptotic expression for the distribution of the largest excursion from the mean level during an arbitrary recurrence period, however based on a mother distribution (different from the Gaussian distribution) that reflects the observed exponentiallike behaviour for large wind speed ex cursions. This is achieved on the expense of an acceptable distribution fit in the data population regime of small to medium excursions which, however, for an extreme investigation is considered unimportant. More specifically, we postulate the following conjecture the tails of a total population of velo city fluctuations can be approximated by a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 12.;U (z, t)  U (z)  u (z, t) , (19.1)where an upper bar denotes the mean value operator, u(z, t) are turbulence excursions, z denotes the altitude above terrain, and t is the time coordinate. The PDF of the extreme segment of the excursions, ue(z, t), is thus expressed as;, (19.2)where u is the standard deviation of the total data population, and C(z) is a dimensionless, but site and heightdependant, positive constant.;usign (v) v2  C (z)  0 . (19.4);, (19.5)which is recognized as a Gaussian distribution.
