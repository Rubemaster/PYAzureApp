4 B. Langeand 30 m height versus stability is shown together with measured results from the two sites Rdsand and FINO 1 (Lange, 2004). It can be seen that the Rdsand data show a larger wind speed ratio for near neutral and stable conditions than expected from theory.;A qualitative explanation of this result based on (Csanady, 1974) has beendeveloped (Lange et al., 2004) Rdsand is surrounded by land in all directions with a distance to the coast of 10 to 100 km. When warm air is advected from land over a colder sea, an internal boundary layer with stable stratification develops at the coastline. The heat flow through the stable layer is small, and the air close to the water is cooled continuously from the sea surface. It will eventually take the temperature of the sea and become a wellmixed layer with nearneutral stratification. Higher up an inversion develops with strongly stable stratification. In such a situation with strong height inhomogeneity of atmospheric heat flux, MoninObukhov theory must fail. At the FINO 1 site, the coastline is much further away for almost all wind directions and this flow situation does not develop.;For planning and operation of offshore wind farms, it is important to take into account the specific conditions at offshore locations. As shown above, the vertical wind speed profile can be modified significantly in the coastal zone. A simple correction method has been proposed to evaluate the magnitude of the effect for wind power applications (Lange et al., 2004a). The effect of this correction on the profile can be seen in Fig. 1.4, where different theoretical wind profiles are compared.
