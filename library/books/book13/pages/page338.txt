62 Reliability of Wind Turbines 331respect. Based on the above evaluations, however, for the WTs under 500 kW it can be expected that the failure rate due to wearout failures does not increase before the 15th year of operation.;The reported downtimes are caused by both regular maintenance and unfore seen malfunctions. The following evaluations refer only to the latter, which concerned half mechanical and half electrical components (Fig. 62.2).;The duration of downtimes, caused by malfunctions, are dependent onnecessary repair work, on the availability of replacement parts and on the personnel capacity of service teams. In the past, repairs to generator 2, drive train, hub, gearbox and blades have often caused standstill periods of several weeks.;Taking into account all the reported repair measures now available, theaverage failure rate and the average downtime per component can be given (Fig. 62.3). It gets clear, that the downtimes declined in the past 510 years. So, the high number of failures of some components is now balanced out to
