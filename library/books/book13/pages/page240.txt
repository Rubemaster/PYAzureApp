The unity of rotor and nacelle was designed as shown in Fig. 41.1. Since effects from the tower are not investigated in this phase of the study it was not implemented within the geometry. As a consequence the 120 symmetry of the three bladed rotor and nacelle could be used. This is a common attempt in turbo machinery simulation and reduces the calculating effort significantly. Hub, nacelle and blade design are based on a Winwind WWD1 turbine.;The upper surface of the domain is designed as an opening boundary condition to allow the typical expansion of the stream tube around the WT. Within the flow regime the rotor has a 100 m distance upwind and 450 m downwind till the boundaries of the domain, its radius is 100 m. A higher mesh quality was achieved by using three general grid interfaces (GGI) that permit a high grid resolution in the hub area with an reasonable amount of grid elements. The numerical simulation was performed using the Reynolds Averaged NavierStokes Equation (RANS) with the standard k model.;On this basis the aerodynamic power was derived from the pressure field on the rotor blade surface and agrees well with technical specification and measurements. The resulting flow separation area along the blade shows good agreement with observations of the manufacturer. Since k models tend to underestimate flow separation 3, the calculated separated area is smaller than found in reality, which is shown in Fig. 41.4. Through this simulation several effects were observed. Here two of them are described. The two velocity distributions in Fig. 41.3 both rely on the same velocity scale from 0 to 30 m s1. The domination of radial flow components in the
