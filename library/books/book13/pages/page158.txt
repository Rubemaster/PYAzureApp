140 P. Srensen et al.used PSD and coherence functions. For that purpose, wind measurements on Riss test site for large wind turbines in Hsre, Denmark have been used.;The test site in Hvsre is outlined in Fig. 25.1. It is located only a few km from the west coast of Jutland, on a very flat terrain. The test station is designed to enable test of five large wind turbines simultaneously. For the test of each of the wind turbine, a met mast is erected 247 m west of the wind turbine. Besides, two light masts are erected as indicated in the figure.;The positioning of these masts on a line is very useful for studies of coherence. Only results from met mast 5 and met mast 4 are presented in this paper. The distance between neighbouring met masts is 307 m, and the line is oriented 4 degrees from straight northsouth. The met masts are equipped with a cup anemometer on the top and a wind direction measurement on a boom 2 m lower. The height of each mast has changed slightly a couple of times during the measurement period, because it has been adjusted to the hub height of
