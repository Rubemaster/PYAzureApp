The purpose of this study is to introduce an original blade profile optimization method in wind energy aerodynamic context. The first 2D implementation focuses on Darrieus vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). This class of VAWT is generally associated with classical aeronautic blade profiles (NACA0012 to NACA0018) whereas Reynolds number and stall conditions are different in aerogeneration case 1. The objectives of the multicriteria optimization pro posed are to increase the nominal power production, to widen the efficiency range in order to take into account of wind instability and to reduce blade weight and by this way minimizing inertial constraint and mechanical fatigue.;39.2.1 Templin Method for Efficiency Graphe Computation
