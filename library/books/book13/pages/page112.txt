Fig. 15.4. Left The telescope head of the laser Doppler anemometer from QinetiQ 9. Right Mounting of the laser anemometer behind the nacelle of a Tellus turbine;Fig. 15.5. Observation of a wake at four downstream distances 20, 85, 150, and 215 m. The wake appear to be to the left;The focus is changed in such a way that the same wake deficit is followed downstream from the turbine 2. More systematic measurements and detailed comparison with the model will soon be done.
