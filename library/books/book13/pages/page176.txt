K. Kaiser, W. Langreder, H. Hohlen and J. Hjstrup;Summary. Measured power curves depend on more sitespecific parameters than covered by international standards. We present a method to quantify the combined influence of three effects of the turbulence intensity. The method has been tested for different types of turbines with good results. Hence the uncertainty related to site specific turbulence on the power curve can be reduced.;Precise power curve measurements and verifications are important for inves tors, bankers and insurers. Most contracts specify a procedure according to the IEC regulation 1, to verify the power curve of the purchased WT either on site or under standard conditions. However the IEC regulation does not cover all effects on the measurement relating to site specific wind climates e.g. turbulence. It is known that both anemometers and WTs respond to turbulence in very specific ways. Hence measurements of the power curve will be affected by turbulence, which is related to the topography of the site 2. The impact of turbulence on the anemometer has been described e.g. in 3. The qualitative response of WTs to turbulence is known. Due to the com plexity of a WT system a quantitative description of the turbines response is difficult to find. Furthermore the process of binning will introduce an inher ent numeric error. Due to the nonlinearity, especially near cutin and rated wind speed, the procedure described in the IEC regulation is sensitive to wind speed variations. These three effects lead to the conclusion that a measured power curve is influenced by the turbulence distribution at the test site 4. Therefore, power curve measurements of identical turbines at different loca tions will lead to different results. As a consequence measured power curves have only limited comparable and transferable properties.
