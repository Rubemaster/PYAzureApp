274 D. Moroianu and L. Fuchs;The corresponding sound pressure level (SPL) field is depicted in Fig. 50.3 (below right). As expected, in the far field the SPL intensity decreases as if the wind turbine is a point source. The isocontours become almost spherical at a distance of about 3D. The interferences from the ground in the far field are also weak and cannot be observed in the sound pressure levels.;The focus of the present work has been on the computation of the flow around a wind turbine as well as on the spreading of the sound that it generates. The vortex dynamics have been found to be in agreement with experiments. In order to compute the noise generated by the turbine, an acoustic analogy has been used. The acoustical field close to the wind turbine is dominated by the rotation frequency of the blades (BPF). In the far field the spectrum is influenced by the ground so different modes are stronger. There is a decay in the amplitude of the sound with the distance and far from the wind turbine, the acoustical waves are spread spherically as if they are coming from a point source. The influence of the mast in the process of generation and propagation of sound is not so strong. To asses the influence of terrain irregularities or air dissipation, further work is required.;1.
