As the introduced transformation, g(), is strictly monotone, every localextreme in the real process, u(z, t), is transformed into a local extreme in the fictitious transformed process, v(z, t). Thus, the number of local extremes (and their position on the timeaxis) is unaltered by the performed transformation.;mln(T ) , (19.6)where  is the zeroupcrossing frequency multiplied by 2.;The asymptotic probability density function expressed in (19.7) is seen to be of the EV1 type 8, which is consistent with the finding from several ex perimental studies 57. It can be shown that, contrary to the asymptotic PDF described by Cartwright  LonguetHiggens, the root mean square asso ciated with (19.7) is independent of the time span considered, and the present asymptotic extreme value distribution thus does not narrow with increasing time span.;What remains now is to determine the transformation constant, C(z),such that the best possible agreement between the upper tails of measured PDFs and the proposed asymptotic fit is obtained. This calibration has been performed based extensive full scale measuring campaigns, representing three different terrain types  offshorecoastal, flat homogeneous terrain and hilly scrub terrain.;C (z)  az  b , (19.8)where the values of a and b for the three investigated terrain categories, are given in Table 19.1.
