Comparison of structural stress approach to notch stress approachof dimensions and different crack locations. The compliance of the structural stress approach (SSA) with the NSA is excellent leading to a bestfit hot spot SN curve FAT98 (compared to 100 N mm2 as the reference value) and an average plate thickness exponent k of 0.245. The heel points are an exception because the underlying volume weld model with the gross section according to AWS results in too steep flank angles. The benefits of the local approach are used for an application to the case of singleside welded joints for which insufficient test data is available. Here the comparison with a reduced hotspot SN curve as recommended by off shore standards shows an overestimation of lifetime by the SSA, which cannot be explained by the slight overestimation of strength reduction for short gaps mentioned in 1. For the analysed tubular joints, local bending effects due to the weld shape stay uncovered by the hotspot method, especially for the brace saddle locations.
