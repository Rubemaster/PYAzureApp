The comparison with anotherturbulence model in future is reasonable. The calculated drag values are considerably below measured values. This is probably due to experimental conditions.;The discrete roughness created with an obstacle as part of the airfoilcontour indicates a correct trend with a decreasing liftdrag ratio against the obstacle height. However, the calculated liftdrag ratios are considerably too large. The effect on the transition location is small. The discrete rough ness represented by an additional turbulence source does not have a significant effect.;1. Rooij R.P.J.O.M. van, Timmer W.A. (2003) Roughness considerations for thick;1.
