Assuming that all wake vorticity is included in the tip and the root vortex,the circulation at tip and root should approximately correspond to the max imum bound circulation of the blade. This is of course an idealization, since the rollup of the vortex sheets is expected to form a concentrated vorticity distribution in the far wake 7. The computed circulation at the blades is given in Fig. 48.3.;Figure 48.3 shows some wiggles that start at about 500 behind the bladesfor the root vortex and about 800 behind the blade for the tip vortex. These are most likely due to integration errors when integrating the circulation. At these positions the vortex core starts to be smeared out and it therefore becomes difficult to identify a good integration path.;Helmholtz. The tip vortex leaves the blade with a circulation value close to the maximum bound circulation at the blades. The root vortex leaves the blade with a much lower value of the circulation, but it increases rapidly and reaches values at the same order as the bound circulation. The reason why the root vortex is smeared out earlier than the tip vortex is partly because the vortex cores are closer at the root and partly because of the radial gradient of the circulation. The result is in good agreement with classical theorems from Helmholtz, from which it follows that the wake tip vortex has the same circu lation as the maximum value of the bound circulation on the blade. A likely explanation for this good agreement is that the symmetry of the flow domain prohibits the rollup of the vortex sheet from the blades.
