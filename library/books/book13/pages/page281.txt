272 D. Moroianu and L. Fuchs;272 D. Moroianu and L. Fuchsa;Fig. 50.1. Flow (left) and acoustical (right) computational domainscondition on face efgh  constant pressure and a turbulence intensity of I  4 is imposed, free stream boundary conditions on faces bcgf, dcgh and adhe, the rest of the surfaces (abfe and the surface defining the wind turbine) are wall boundary conditions. The flow computational domain is included in a box with the following dimensions L1  L2  1.54  D and L3  0.38  D where D  26m is the rotor diameter. The position of the rotor above the ground is H;D  0.8. The cross section profile is from a NACA 4415 airfoil. The blade is twisted to keep a constant angle of attack of 7. The spatial discretization of the domain was based on an estimation of the Taylor length scale outside the rotor and near the blade. The computational domain of the acoustical problem is much larger than the computational problem of the flow field, and the far field of the acoustical field is depicted schematically in Fig. 50.1 (right). The boundary conditions that are set for the acoustical problem are as follows on all boundaries, nonreflecting conditions are set, whereas on the ground, fully reflective conditions are imposed.;The flow contributes to the noise sources mainly at regions of large gradients in the flow as at the tip of the blade which is an important generator of shear. This vortices are formed due to the pressure difference between pressure and suction side of the blade and they are extended backward transported by the flow in a spiral mode, as seen in Fig. 50.2. They are interacting with the mast and with the vortices that are developing behind it.
