34 J. Fernandez Puga et al.;The measurements have been carried out in the wind tunnel of the University of Kaiserslautern using the laser Doppler anemometry operating in backscat ter mode. The seeding particles which have a size of 2m are made by spraying a solution of glycerine and water. In order to carry out feasible measurements the experimental setup has been chosen according to the German VDIguideline 3783. The boundary layer has been thickened artificially using spires which were fixed at the entrance of the test section. The power law exponent of the modelled atmospheric bound ary layer (Fig. 6.1) has a value of 0.16 which corresponds to a moderately rough terrain according to the guideline. Furthermore, the turbulence intensities in longitudinal, lateral and vertical direction (Fig. 6.2) represent also a moderately rough terrain. The spectral
