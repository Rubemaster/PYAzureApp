Broken lines Analytical forms 2;In Fig. 4.3 we present finally the scaled standard deviations of velocity, wu and uu vs. zL, for z between 10 and 100 m. For wu analytical expressions are shown as a broken line. No general simple form exists for uu vs. zL. For unstable conditions it becomes a function of hL and for stable condition it growths slowly with zL. We believe that use of local scaling is partly responsible for the some of behavior with zL since h varies somewhat systematically with zL.;We have considered mean flow and turbulence over land and water based on data from Hvsre, above the surface layer proper. We have seen that thermal stability cannot be neglected for these heights, neither over land nor water, that the wind profiles adapt to the standard models for internal boundary layers, and that the wind aloft has a tendency to increase more than loga rithmic, either due to the boundary length scale of 1 or due to the influence of stability and a length scale based on the BruntVaisala frequency 4. For neutral to stable conditions it is understood that these two scales may be related. Additionally, we have found that the scaled wu vs. zL largely follows standard formulations, while uu is less well behaved. Some of the behavior of wu and uu can be explained by that the plots are based on local
