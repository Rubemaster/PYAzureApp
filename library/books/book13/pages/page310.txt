302 J. Reetzinformation about the current stiffness parameters by means of the given model and the measured eigenfrequencies. Due to the formulation as multi parameter eigenvalue problem the illposed problem is transformed into common linear eigenvalue problems. The last step is the diagnostics. Thereby the interpretation of parameters provides detection, quantification and local isation of the damage. To simplify matters the equations hold for a number of two parameters without loss of generality. The problem of identification of the stiffness parameters by means of measured eigenfrequencies is;(2M  a1K1  a2K2) g2  0. (56.1);(0A20  1A21  2A22) g2  B2g2  0 (56.2)with the stiffness parameters i  0ai and the model matrices Aik. Every row is posed in the space of physical coordinates. There is a dependence of the required information on the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of the model and hence a lack of information. This problem is illposed. But with the linear maps B one can define linear induced maps B as follows;The maps B1 and B2 act on the element g1 and g2, respectively and the identity acts on the other elements. The application of these induced linear maps on the problem shows in (56.4) that if and only if the righthand side holds, the lefthand side also holds;This problem is posed in the space of tensor products. By extension of the use of determinants for systems of linear equations one can apply the rules of determinants on this linear induced operators. Then one obtains compositions of maps (see (56.6)) called determinantal maps, i.e.
