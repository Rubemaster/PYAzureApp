This is a direct implication of one of the basic assumptions of Joukowski, that the circulation along each rotor blade is constant ( ) and that the total circulation is zero. If we look at experimental data, however, a constant axial velocity profile is rarely seen 1,5. In order to develop a model that is capable of reproducing measured ve locity distributions, we extend the model of Joukowski by assuming the tip vortices to be embedded in an axisymmetric helical vortex field formed from the circulation 0 of the rotor blades and the hub (see Fig. 45.1b). The result ing axial and azimuthal velocity components are described by the following formulas;From (45.2) it is seen that the azimuthally averaged axial velocity is constant in the wake.
