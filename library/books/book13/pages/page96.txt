Summary. Regions interesting for the installation of windmills possess large mean wind velocity, but this is also associated to large Reynolds numbers and huge velocity fluctuations. Such fully developed turbulence is generally characterized by intermit tent fluctuations on a wide range of scales. There are many gusts (large fluctuations of the wind velocity at small scales), producing extreme loading on wind turbine structure. Here we consider the dynamics of gusts the recurrent times of large fluctuations for a fixed time increment, and also inverse times corresponding to the times needed to have wind fluctuations larger than a fixed threshold. We dis cuss theoretically these two different quantities, and provide an example of data analysis using wind data recorded at 10 Hz. The objective here is to provide theo retical relations that will help for the interpretation of available data, and for their extrapolation.;Wind turbines need theoretically large and constant wind velocities to be optimally efficient. However, this is not possible since large velocities corre spond to high Reynolds numbers and fully developed turbulence situations, characterized by intermittent fluctuations of the wind velocity having highly nonlinear and nonGaussian properties 13. Turbulent wind fluctuate at all scales in intensity and in direction, producing high loading on wind turbine structure, large fluctuations on wind turbine force and moments, and high variability on wind turbine power output. Here we focus on smallscale wind fluctuations called wind gusts, which produce most of the fatigue loading on turbine structures we consider theoretically, with data analysis applications, the dynamics of these gusts the recurrent times of large fluctuations for a fixed small time increment (also called return times or waiting times), and also inverse times corresponding to the times needed to have wind fluctuations larger than a fixed threshold.
