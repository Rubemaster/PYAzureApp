Fig. 40.5. Comparison of surface pressure distribution on a nonrotating and a rotating airfoillower pressure on the rotating airfoil suction surface leads to a greater lift, already observed in 2.;c ),which can be separated in four main areas, has been analysed in order to quantify the displacement zone of the separation point (Fig. 40.6). The zone 1 shows a strong increase of  due to the fluctuation of the stagnation point near the leading edge. Zones 2 and 4 show a relatively constant  and zone 3 shows a bump of .
