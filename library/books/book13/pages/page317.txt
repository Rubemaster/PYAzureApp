Grouted Joints are well known for offshore platforms in the oil and petroleum industry. Besides, they have already been used in Monopilefoundations and are being considered for Tripodfoundations in deeper water for offshore wind energy converters. In offshore wind energy applications, only ultrahigh per formance concrete (UHPC) has been used up to now. UHPC itself is known for its outstanding mechanical characteristics in static tests, but only little is known about the dynamic behaviour in terms of fatigue strength, damage development or the performance in Grouted Joints.;In contrast to the UHPC mix tested in Aalborg, heat treatment withdifferent temperatures was used in Hannover and Kassel. In addition, the UHPC mix tested in Kassel contained 2.5 vol. of 9 mm long steel fibres. The tests performed by the University of Kassel are displayed as a dashed line, because the number of tests was limited.;Deformation measurements and the development of Youngs modulus during fatigue tests have indicated, that the distinct brittleness of UHPC can also be observed in fatigue loading. These results are in good agreement with deformation measurements on UHPC reported in 3.
