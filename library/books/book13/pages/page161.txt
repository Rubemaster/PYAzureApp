Fig. 25.3. Two points r and c each corresponding to a wind turbine. The distance between the two points r and c is drc, with a direction rc from north. V0 is the mean wind speed, and V is the wind direction. rc is the resulting inflow angle, and rc is the delay time;Fig. 25.4.

The result is based on 2 h segments. The coherence is shown for data with 2 h mean wind speeds V0 in the intervals 4 m s1  V0  8 m s1 (Fig. 25.4) and 12 m s1 V0  20 m s1 (Fig. 25.5), respectively.;The complex expression of the coherence is used in Fig. 25.4. The leftgraphs show the amplitude, whereas the right graphs show the phase angle. The measured data is compared to a Davenport coherence (25.5) using Schlez and Infields suggested decay parameter in (25.7). It is observed that the model overestimates the coherence significantly for low wind speeds as well as
