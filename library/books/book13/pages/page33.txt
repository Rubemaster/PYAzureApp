Stability effects due to the different thermal properties of water comparedto land have been shown to be very important (Barthelmie, 1999), (Lange et al., 2004). Both the surface roughness and the surface temperature change abruptly at the coastline, which leads to important transition effects for wind blowing from land to the sea. Additionally, other effects like currents and tides influence the wind speed over water (Barthelmie, 2001).;The dedicated meteorological measurements made in connection withplanned offshore wind power development helped to improve the knowledge about the wind conditions relevant for offshore wind farm installations. One example is the vertical wind speed profile over coastal waters.
