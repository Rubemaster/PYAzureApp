In this study MAGwelded flange segments (S355J2G3) directly attached to a flat web, by a double bevel seam have been investigated. The two half segments were connected by one bolt. Additionally a butt weld has been incorporated into the web. The specimens have been clean blasted (SA 2 12). For more details see 3,4.;55.4.1 Initial State of the Fatigue Test Samples;To characterize the surface changes caused by the different improvement methods micrographs and profiles measured by laser triangulation sensors of the weld toe of a butt welded joint in sand blasted, shot peened and ul trasonic peened condition have been compared. The graphs show that the peening treatment leads to a notch radius, directly connected with the ra dius of the tip of the used peening tool used. However, in the transition zone between the peened toe and the adjacent base material respectively the weld metal the material is raised causing small sharp geometrical notches (Fig 55.1) so that the weld toe profile is not always improved by the peening treat ment. Transverse residual stress profiles and profiles of the integral width of the measured diffraction lines, both measured by Xray diffraction, have been analysed and compared to an aswelded state observed after an electrochemical removal of a 0.3 mm thick surface layer (Fig 55.2). Whereas shot peening and clean blasting lead to an homogeneous cold hardening effect without signif icant peaks at the weld toe or in the weld seam the hardening effect of the UP is limited to the region of the treated weld toe. The residual stress dis tribution shows that only shot peening leads to an almost uniform state of
