Fig. 25.6. Measured lateral coherence between wind speeds on mast 5 and mast 4 for segments with 4 m s1  V0  8 m s1high wind speeds. The model phase angel is obtained assuming a time delay corresponding to the travel time from r to c with the mean wind speed V0.;Figure 25.6 shows the measured lateral coherence between wind speeds onmast 5 and mast 4. The lateral direction is here assumed to be with wind directions in the sector from 270 to 280 deg. Comparison to the model show better agreement for lateral decay factor proposed by Schlez and Infield.;A PSD including the wind speed fluctuations in the time scale from minutes to 9 h has been fitted based on the measurements. The fitted low frequency spectrum applies quite well for different mean wind speeds.
