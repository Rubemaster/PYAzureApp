Fig. 14.2. Measured wind profiles at the FINO1 platform in comparison with the IEC614003 and the GLOffshore guidelineintensity with increasing wind speed. In the GLguideline the standard devi ation of the longitudinal wind speed at hub height 1 is defined as;1  I15(15 m s1  aVhub)(a  1) (14.2)with Vhub the wind speed at hub height and class parameters a and I15 as defined in Fig. 14.1. The turbulence intensity 1Vhub is shown in Fig. 14.3
