Summary. Wind farms built at offshore locations are likely to become an important part of the electricity supply of the future. For an efficient development of this energy source, in depth knowledge about the wind conditions at such locations is therefore crucial. Offshore wind power meteorology aims to provide this knowledge. This paper describes its scope and argues why it is needed for the efficient development of offshore wind power.;Wind power utilization for electricity production has a huge resource and has proven itself to be capable of producing a substantial share of the elec tricity consumption. It is growing rapidly and can be expected to contribute substantially to our energy need in the future (GWEC, 2005). The fuel of this electricity production is the wind. The wind is, on the other hand, also the most important constraint for turbine design, as it creates the loads the turbines have to withstand.;Therefore, accurate knowledge about the wind is needed for planning,design and operation of wind turbines. Some tasks where specific meteoro logical knowledge is essential are wind turbine design, resource assessment, wind power forecasting, etc. Wind power meteorology has therefore estab lished itself as an important topic in applied meteorology (Petersen et al., 1998). For wind power utilization on land, substantial knowledge and experi ence has been gained in the last decades, based on the detailed meteorological and climatological knowledge available. Offshore, the meteorological knowl edge is less developed since there has been little need to know the wind at heights of wind turbines over coastal waters and any measurements at offshore locations are difficult and extremely expensive.
