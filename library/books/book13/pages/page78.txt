52 E. MorynKucharczyk and R. Gnatowska;Fig. 9.4. Computational distributions of a) stream function b) amplitude of trans verse velocity oscillationssimulation mentioned above provided the mean velocity distributions as well as characteristics of turbulence structure around tandem arrangement. The special emphasize has been put on intensity of velocity oscillation in space around bluffbodies. The sample results, shown in Fig. 9.4a present the instantaneous computational distributions of stream function corresponding to different dynamic states of the flow in body system environment. The cen treline distributions of amplitude of transverse velocity oscillations are also juxtaposed in Fig. 9.4b. One may suppose that transport of pollutants is inten sified by periodical velocity component, generated in flow around bluffbodies arrangement, especially for the critical body spacing. In this case the maxi mum of concentration, move forwards in the centreline of the wake.;In an experimental study of bluffbodies tandem arrangement the significant changes have been observed in the concentration field of the tracer gas for dif ferent spacing ratio. Depending on body spacing the maximum concentration of CO2 is localized outside of the gap (double peak) or migrates towards the centreline. The interbody gap is filled up by the emitted gas more intensively as the level of energy of oscillating velocity component increases (critical body spacing). The problem needs further studies.;1.
