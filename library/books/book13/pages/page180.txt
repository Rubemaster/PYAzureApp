J.J. Trujillo, A. Wessel, I. Waldl and B. Lange;Summary. From practical experience it is known that many reasons for an unsatis fying energy yield of wind farms occur. Particular issues are difficult to discern due to the interaction of the turbines through wake effects. Therefore, reliable wind farm modeling is necessary in order to assess faulty operation and energy production of single turbines. In this paper a method to obtain the expected performance for each single turbine in a wind farm in online basis is presented and tested with real measured data.;Our approach to the single turbine power performance assessment of single turbines is to extend a wind farm model in order to make it work with qua sireal time data. Time series of operational data of a wind farm are fed to the model which calculates average power delivered by each single turbine. The modeled power is compared afterward to the measured power data. The wind farm model will be integrated into the wind farm management system OptiFarmTM 1 for wind turbine surveillance purposes.;The selected wind farm model is the farm layout programm (FLaP), an advanced model developed at Oldenburg University 3, 6. The model man ages the superposition of wakes and other relevant wind farm effects to pre dict an effective wind speed at hub height of each turbine. Finally, the power produced by the turbine is calculated with the power curve of the turbine and the modeled effective wind speed. Extended versions of two wake models, namely Ainslie 2 and Jensen 5 model, have been implemented in FLaP for single wake calculation.
