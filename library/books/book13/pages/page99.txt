A portion of the 3s increment time series large fluctuations correspond to 3s gusts. Gusts associated to a velocity  1 m s1 are shown, together with the construction of their recurrent timesprocess is Brownian motion using dimensional arguments, Feller 10 showed that the pdf of their firstpassage times is of the form;p(T)  T  (13.3)with   32. For fractional Brownian motion characterized by an exponent H  (1), it has been shown that the form of (13.3) is still valid, with   2  H 11, 12. For multifractal processes, the choice of a given threshold  selects a fractal blackandwhite process the gust state occurs on a set whose support has a fractal dimension ds the larger the threshold , the smaller the dimension ds characterizing the occurrence of gust events. In such case, the tail behavior of recurrence times has been shown to obey (13.3), with
