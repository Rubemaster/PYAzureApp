200 W. Geissler et al.an important role as well and has to be taken into account by a transition model, 4. In helicopter flows the problem of compressibility is present even if the oncoming flow has a Mach number as small as M  0.3. In this case local supersonic bubbles are present during the upstroke motion. These bubbles are terminated by small but strong shock waves, 2 which trigger the start of the Dynamic Stall process.;The advancing helicopter rotor blade encounters the sum of rotation and forward speeds and runs into transonic conditions with the creation of moving shock waves on the blade upper surface. On the retreating blade the differ ence of rotation and forward speed leads to small local Mach numbers but in order to balance lift on the rotor the incidence has to be increased at this timeinstant and Dynamic Stall occurs during this part of the rotor disc. Figure 36.1 shows the different flow events during Dynamic Stall. The dashed curves indicate the static limit. The lift curve does extend the steady CLmax by almost a factor of two with an extra peak which is caused by the Dynamic Stall Vortex. After its maximum the lift decreases very rapidly and follows a different path during downstroke. Of even larger concern is the pitch ing moment hysteresis loop of Fig. 36.1. It can be shown that the shaded areas between the different parts of the moment loop are a measure of aerodynamic
