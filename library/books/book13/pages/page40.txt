The wave kinematics can be realized to second order for weakly nonlinear waves in deep and shallow water. Equation (2.2) and (2.3) give the first and second order contributions. F(n) are the firstorder component amplitudes, n the angular frequencies and kn the wave numbers. H(n, m) is a quadratic transfer function. For details see 7.;(2.3) The equations are valid to the mean water elevation and have to be extrapo lated to the instantaneous water surface.;In Figs. 2.3 and 2.4 comparisons of linear (1st order) and nonlinear (1st2nd order) realizations of forces and moments are shown 4. For these high waves
