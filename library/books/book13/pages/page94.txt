Fig. 12.3. Mean velocity profiles calculated in LES and DNS (left). Profiles of the deviatoric part of the Reynolds stress tensor (right) calculated in LES with the scale similarity model and compared to DNS data by Kim et al.) (denoted by symbols);In order to give an impression on the performance of the different describedsubgrid scale models, results of LES of a fully developed turbulent channel flow performed for a Reynolds number Re  360 are presented in Fig. 12.3. For both, the mean velocity profile and the resulting deviatoric part of the Reynolds stress tensor Rij  uiuj  uiuj  13(ukuk  ukuk)ij which are compared to the according data of Kim et al. excellent agreement is obtained while the mean values of the underresolved DNS and of the LES with the Smagorinky model shows considerable discrepiances.;The analysis of the eddy viscosity concept which is applied in most RANS and traditional LES turbulence models showed that such models are not able to reliably predict nonisotropic flows. Therefore, if such simulations are per formed to optimize or analyse rotor blades of wind turbines, the obtained results have to be interpreted with caution.;1.
