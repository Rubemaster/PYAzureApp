The threedimensional hill model has been mounted on a flat plate which extends over the entire length and width of the test section. The hill has a height H of 100 mm and a half width W;2 of 250 mm which leads to a charac teristic halfwidth to height ratio of 2.5. The measurements have been carried out with a free stream velocity of 4 m;2 of 250 mm which leads to a charac teristic halfwidth to height ratio of 2.5. The measurements have been carried out with a free stream velocity of 4 ms .;The numerical calculations have been performed with a commercial unstruc tured finitevolume solver which employs a collocated grid. For all equations a secondorder upwind discretization scheme was used, while the pressure velocity coupling has been done with the SIMPLE method. Several turbulence models and some of their variations have been employed 3. The grid has been refined up to the wall reaching dimensionless wall distances of y  4  11 in order to be able to represent the recirculation zone in the lee of the hill. The k   RNG and the k   SST turbulence model calculate the length of the recirculation zone in the lee of the hill in good agreement with the
