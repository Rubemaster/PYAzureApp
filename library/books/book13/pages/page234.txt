Fig. 40.1. Experimental setup. Note turbulence grid (9) in nozzle;The angle of attack at a given section of the blade is r  geo  i where geo is a geometrical angle and i the angle induced by the wind turbine wake. Whereas geo can be easily measured, i cannot be measured and has been obtained using a lifting line code developed at the laboratory.;According to Corten 3, pressure in the separated area is governed, in the chordwise direction by pr  2vr where  is the wind turbine rotational velocity. We assumed that the radial velocity in the separated area, vr, is con stant which leads to a constant chordwise pressure gradient. This assumption has been experimentally validated. Thus, the separated area is defined as the part of the average pressure distribution curve where the slope of the pressure gradient is constant (Fig. 40.2). Tur and r are, respectively, the local stream wise turbulence level and the local angle of attack on the blade. The pressure gradient and the separation point position, DCp, have been obtained. It has also been observed a stall delay for the greatest turbulence level (Fig. 40.3) as it was observed during tests performed at the laboratory on a nonrotating airfoil 4. The pressure gradient values measured have been compared with semi empirical values obtained for a nonturbulent flow Cp r.  4. ;r )2) (5on the basis of 3) (Fig. 40.4). Although semiempirical results are over estimated, probably because of approximation made on radial velocity, they show the same tendency as the experimental ones. The pressure gradient increases with tip speed ratio and turbulence level. Surface pressure distributions on a rotating and a nonrotating airfoil have been compared (Fig. 40.5). The pressure distribution on the rotating and nonrotating airfoil are similar on the pressure side (attached flow), but a
