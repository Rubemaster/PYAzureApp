Probability that an increment of size du is going to the positive direction for a real turbulent flow (left) and the process (22.2) (right)from an investigation of turbulent data recorded in a wind tunnel 4 and leads to focus on sign statistics.;Skewness unravels in the nonzero oddorder structure functions and theasymmetry of the probability density functions (PDFs) p(u) of the velocity field and p(du) of velocity increments. This asymmetry can be depicted nicely in conditional signprobabilities. Figure 22.1a shows the probability p(u) of the sign  of the next increment conditioned on the present value of the velocity. Note that the turning point utp, where it is equally likely to make a step to the positive or to the negative direction is not the mean velocity, which by normalisation has been set to u  0. The sign probability p(du) conditioned on the increment size is shown in Fig. 22.2a. This PDF demon strates that a big increment is more likely to occur in the positive direction than in the negative direction. These two asymmetries play together such that the mean du  0 is zero.
