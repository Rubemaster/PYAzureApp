Fig. 5.2. Mean profiles at FINO1 for the undisturbed sector 190250, u 4 m s1series of wind speeds measured at 30 m height as input. Figures 5.1 and 5.2 show the resulting mean profiles with very small biases of the ICWPs. Fig ure 5.3 reveals that the nonlogarithmic shape of the observed profiles occurs in all conditions of thermal stratification, as it was shown for Horns Rev in 3. The large range of wind speed ratios due to varying thermal stratification lead to a root mean square error (RMSE) of the modelled wind speeds of 5 (FINO1) and 6 (Horns Rev) at 62 m height, and of 10 at 103 m.
