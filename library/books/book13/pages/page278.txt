Streamwise turbulence intensity, 3D downstream of the first, the second and the third row of porous discsvelocity fluctuations increase and the velocity deficit. The annular shape of the turbulence intensity distribution is still visible after the second row. Far ther downstream, this shape is not predominant anymore. It is in agreement with the fact that no additional velocity deficit is generated at the third row.
