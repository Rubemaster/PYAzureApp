This contribution deals with the handling of very common failures and the discussion of outages of wind energy converters (WECs) with doublyfed induction generators (DFIGs) located in wind parks. Measurements were con ducted over a period of time of some months in order to find the tripping source for a high number of WECoutages. The system overview, a failure detection approach and measurement results are presented. Almost all fail ures were followed by discussions about the causes for errors and the resulting responsibility due to the high cost of manpower and cost of necessary mea surements. One part of the discussion is the sensitivity of the WECs against external over and undervoltage, transients and voltage dips. These tolerances are given in EN standards and IECguidelines 1,2.;The DFIGs stator is directly connected to the grid. The rotor is connected to a pulsewidth modulation (pwm) converter which is connected in turn to the mains. Figure 34.1 shows the system overview of the DFIG. The rotor of a DFIG has, compared to standard machines, a high winding number in order to have a highrotor voltage at nominal speed. Therefore, no transformer is required on the rotor side. Due to the highrotor voltage, additional induction effects at stator voltage sags or at fast supply voltage outages may destroy the winding insulation. Transients result, which are avoided by shortcircuiting the rotor windings, using the crowbar 3.;As the generator torque change is highly influenced by the control circuitand the reaction of the electrical side to failures, electrical influences contribute to the fatigue loads of the drive train. These effects are not considered for the gear rating, yet. There are different causes for external failures 4, 5. External distortion sources may be gridside shortcircuits, voltage sags or
