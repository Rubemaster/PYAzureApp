50 E. MorynKucharczyk and R. Gnatowska;Such body configuration is known as a tandem. The interobstacle gapwas changed in the range of nondimensional values SB  0 . . . 6 (obsta cle side dimension B  0.04 m). The results of previous data, contained in works of Jarza  Gnatowska 1, 2, revealed different flow regimes and criti cal body spacing (SB) at which drag coefficient and vortex shedding alter rapidly reflecting the stability mode change. Numerical simulations showed overall changes in flow pictures observed for increasing spacing ratio SB. The program of this study consists of measurement of the mean concentra tion profiles in the interbody gap for different body spacing, comparison of concentration field with aerodynamic characteristics (obtained as a result of numerical simulation performed in ITM CzUT), and recognition of the role of vortex structure and related periodical oscillations.;The isolines of mean concentration for various interobstacle gap width (SB  2, 4, 6), Fig. 9.2, are the first group of results. As one can see from the above figure the different distributions of CO2 concentration are obtained in each case. In the case of SB  2 the maximum value of mean concen tration replaces out of flow axis with an increase in the distance x1B. The region of higher concentration occurs distinctly outside the gap, overshooting downstream cylinder. In accordance with 3 such behaviour could indicate the existence of onebody regime occurring for very small gaps between bod ies. Maximum value of mean concentration is diverted from flow axis with an increase in the distance x1B in the case of SB  6 too, but for the distances x1B  1 it moves to the centreline of the wake. Distinctly different picture of the isolines of mean concentration is observed for SB  4, what justifies the determination of this gap width as critical body spacing. In the above
