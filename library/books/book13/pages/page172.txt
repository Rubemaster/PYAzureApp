In words For a given speed bin j, one determines the number Nk of events in the kth power bin. The power bin k(j) with the maximal number of events gives the point Uj, Lk(j) of the power curve.;With Nk being the number of events in the kth power bin, with speed Ujfixed, the statistical error is of the order Nk. After adding these uncertainties to the measured ones Nk  Nk  Nk, the intervals Nk , possibly, can no longer discriminate between different bins k. In this case one has to increase the bin width and thus the number of events in the bins. The widths of the bins then indicates the likely uncertainty of the curve.;The empirical power curve LPC(U) as shown in Figs. 27.1 and 27.2 wasextracted, by means of the maximum principle, from data of the 2 MW turbine at Tjareborg which were sampled at a rate of 25 Hz over about 24 h 4. The data were averaged over 1 s which resulted in 87,000 points U(ti), L(ti). 520 1s data with negative power output and 137 cases with negative wind speed were set to zero, respectively. The width of the speed bins was 1 m s1, with values chosen in the middle of the intervals at 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, . . . The width of the power bins was variable, in the range from 10 to 50 kW, depending on the number of events. The cutin and cutout speeds were chosen at 5.5 and 31.5 m s1, respectively, where the latter value was the largest power value of the data set. In the interval 5.5  U  13.5 the points were fitted by a cubic polynomial. In the interval 13.5  U, the power was set constant.;To this end, we adopt the standard method by first averaging the data points over 10min. In Fig. 27.3 such averaged points are plotted corresponding to Fig. 27.2 as should be noticed, Fig. 27.2 depicts the points of a part inter val only of length 2.8 h. Next we estimate the power output in two different;Fig. 27.3. Dots averages of Fig. 27.2 over 10 min without exclusion of shutdown events. Upper and lower curve depict our empirical and the Tjareborg 4 power curve, respectively. Further explanation see text
