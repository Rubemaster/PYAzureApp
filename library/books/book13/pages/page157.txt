P. Srensen, J. Mann, U.S. Paulsen and A. Vesth;Summary. For the simulation of power fluctuations from wind farms, the power spectral density of the wind speed in a single point, and the coherence between two points in the same height but with different horizontal coordinates are esti mated based on wind measurements on Riss test station for large wind turbines in Hvsre, Denmark.;A major issue in the control and stability of electric power systems is to maintain the balance between generated and consumed power. Because of the fluctuating nature of wind speeds, the increasing use of wind turbines for power generation has caused more focus on the fluctuations in the power production of the wind turbines, especially when the wind turbines are con centrated geographically in large wind farms.;An example of this is observations of the Danish transmission system operator (TSO). Based on measurements of power fluctuations from the 160 MW offshore wind farm Horns Rev in western Denmark, the Danish TSO has found that the fluctuating nature of wind power introduces several challenges to re liable operation of the power system in western Denmark, and also that the wind power contributes to deviations in the planned power exchange with the central European (UCTE) power system, see Akhmatov et al. 1. It was also observed that the time scale of the power fluctuations was from tens of minutes to several hours.;A model for simulation of simultaneous wind speed fluctuations in manypoints  corresponding to many wind turbines  with different horizontal coordinates has been developed by Srensen et al. 2 and implemented in the software program PARKWIND.
