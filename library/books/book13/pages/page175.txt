Time t and g are in units of seconds and reciprocal meter, respectivelyproblem that, at the Tjareborg site, wind speed is measured relatively far away from the turbine, at a distance of 120 m, which poses the question whether the relevant wind fluctuations acting in the rotor plane are still sufficiently correlated with the windspeed fluctuations measured far away, especially in view of the response times of the order of a couple of seconds.;In conclusion we have shown, that an empirical power curve can beextracted from highfrequency measurements of only one day. Second, we demonstrated that for a proper power output prediction effects of delayed response have to be considered.;1. A. Rauh and J. Peinke, A phenomenological model for the dynamic response of;1.
