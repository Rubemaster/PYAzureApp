For small tolerance parameters and also for the (N 1) analysis based on the average loads, only a relatively small fluctuation strength is needed to knock out a sizeable fraction ( 20) of the network.;The second model extension is motivated from another windpower relatedpicture a small fraction q  0.1 of (conventional power plant) nodes with large source capacity scpp face a large fraction 1q of (repowering wind energy) nodes with small source strength swind. Instead of (26.7), the source strengths are then assigned according to the bimodal distribution;picture a small fraction q  0.1 of (conventional power plant) nodes with large source capacity scpp face a large fraction 1q of (repowering wind energy) nodes with small source strength swind. Instead of (26.7), the source strengths are then assigned according to the bimodal distributionp(s)  q (s  rscpp)  (1  q) (s  swind) . (26.8);In case of swind  0, the c.p.p. nodes produce at full capacity scpp with no reduction (r  1). The setting scpp  1q then insures s  1 as in the previous model discussions. With increasing (repowering) swind the c.p.p. nodes produce less to conserve the overall production (s  1). This fixes the reduction parameter to r  (1  q)swind. The capacity layout of the network according to Cn  (1  )Ln or the (N  1) analysis is done for swind  0, which corresponds to the old times when only c.p.p. nodes were produced. With the introduction of source strengths swind  0, small at first but then further increasing (repowering), again the concern is on the robustness of the network against cascading overload failure. Figure 26.3b reveals that already relatively small source strengths suffice to lead to a major network disruption. Only a further investment into the network in the form of larger tolerance parameters appears to help.;The (toy) model extensions introduced in the previous section allow room for further realistic improvements. Only then it makes sense to import and modify concepts from modern information and communication technologies, like for example those of 1, 2, and to start building a Power Internet. The latter would include the distributive and selforganized monitoring and control of wind farms and the power grid.;1. Glauche I., Krause W., Sollacher R., Greiner M. (2004) Phys. A 341677701 2.
