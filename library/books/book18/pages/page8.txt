Links between chapters. With the overall structure justified above, we can turn to how to the chapters themselves and how they are linked. Each chapter described below should stand almost alone. Each chapter (except the first) should have an introductory section linking the chapter to the main idea of the previous chapter and outlining the aim and the organisation of the chapter. For example, the core ideas in an introduction to Chapter 3 might be;Chapter 2 identified several research issues this next chapter describes the methodology used to provide data to investigate them. An introduction to the methodology was provided in Section 1.4 of chapter 1 this chapter aims to build on that introduction and to provide assurance that appropriate procedures were followed. The chapter is organised around four major topics the study region, the sampling procedure, nominal group technique procedures, and data processing.;The introductory section of Chapter 5 (that is, Section 5.1) will be longer than those of other chapters, for it will summarise all earlier parts of the thesis prior to making conclusions about the research described in those earlier parts that is, Section 5.1 will repeat the research problem and the research issuespropositions. Each chapter should also have a concluding summary section that outlines major themes established in the chapter, without introducing new material.
