A five section or chapter structure can be used to effectively present a thesis, and it is summarised in Figure 1 and Table 1. Remember that a thesis can actually have more than five chapters, as discussed above and below, and in Table 1. Thus the term chapter is used in this paper in a generic sense perhaps section could have been used rather than chapter but doing so may have been confusing because there are sections within each chapter.;In brief, the thesis should have a unified structure (EasterbySmith et al. 1991). Firstly, Chapter 1 introduces the core research problem and then sets the scene and outlines the path that the examiner will travel towards the thesis conclusion. The research itself is described in Chapters 2 to 5 . the research problem and propositionshypotheses arising from the body of knowledge developed during previous research (Chapter 2),;. conclusions about the propositionshypotheses and research problem based on the results of Chapter 4, including their place in the body of knowledge outlined previously in Chapter 2 (Chapter 5).;Justification of the structured approach. This five chapter structure can be justified. Firstly, the structure is unified and focussed on solving the one research problem. Thus it addresses the major fault of postgraduate theses in Nightingales (1984) survey of 139 examiners reports, that is, it clearly addresses those examiners difficulty in discerning what was the thesis of the thesis? Nightingale concluded that unity and focus depend on supervisors emphasising
