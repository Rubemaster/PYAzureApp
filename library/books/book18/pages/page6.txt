6throughout students candidacies that they are striving in the thesis to communicate one big idea (Nightingale 1984, p. 174). That one big idea is the research problem stated on page 1 or 2 of the thesis and explicitly solved in Chapter 5. EasterbySmith et al. (1991) also emphasise the importance of consistency in a PhD thesis, Phillips and Pugh (1987, p. 38) confirm that a thesis must have a thesis or a position, and Lindsay (1995, pp. 104, 105) insists that the unifying hypothesis  the purpose of the thesis must be clear from the very beginning.;Justified changes to the structure. Some changes to the five chapter structure could be justified, as noted above and shown in Table 1. For example, a student may find it convenient to expand the number of chapters to six or seven because of unusual characteristics of the analysis in his or her research for example, a PhD might consist of two stages some qualitative research reported in Chapters 3 and 4 of the thesis described below, which is then followed by some quantitative research to refine the initial findings reported in Chapters 5 and 6 the Chapter 5 described below would then become Chapter 7.;In addition, PhD theses at universities that allow huge theses may have extra chapters added to contain the extended reviews of bodies of knowledge in those huge theses. I am thinking here of those universities which allow a PhD thesis to rise from a minimum length of about 50 000 to 60 000 words (Phillips  Pugh 1987), through the 70 000 to 80 000 words preferred by many examiners, up to the upper limit of 100 000 words specified by some established universities like the University of Queensland and Flinders University. By the way, a thesis is normally at the lower end of this range, that is, it normally comes to about 220 to 250 pages. In brief, in some theses, the five chapters may become five sections with one or more chapters within each
