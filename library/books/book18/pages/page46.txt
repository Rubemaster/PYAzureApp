(Developed by Chad Perry and colleagues, revised on 15.08.02);Consistently using a house style like Style Manual (2002) in your thesis will protect you from the criticisms of idiosyncratic and pedantic examiners. There are two or three style manuals to choose from but I recommend Style Manual because it is used in all communications with the Australian government, for example, in proposals for consulting projects, and is used by most publishers of books and journals in Australia.;Thus this note shows how to present references in the text of your thesis, how to present a list of references at the end of a thesis, and also covers some other some style issues. The note is based primarily on the 2002 edition of Style Manual (2002), and on Peters (1995) and Smith and Summers (1999). Details of these publications are at the end of this note. A note at the end of this appendix discusses how the 2002 edition of Style Manual differs from previous editions.;By the way, spelling in Australia should follow either the Macquarie Dictionary or The Australian Oxford Dictionary and follow its first preferences consistently. As a prelude for this, set up ToolsLanguageSet LanguageEnglish (Australian)OK in your Microsoft Word software. For a thesis, your left margin should be 3 or 4 cm (depending on your university it is 3 cm at SCU) and the other margins should be 2.54 cm. Font should be 12 point Times New Roman.;In the text of your assignment or dissertation, the citations of authors are presented in the Harvard style, for example, Smith (1998), (Smith 1998), Smith (1998, p. 3) and (Smith 1998, p. 3). Note that there is no comma between the name and the year, but there is a comma after the date if a quotation necessitates the page number being added. You have to put in the page number if you are referring to a quotation or to figuresdata produced in a research project.;If there is no author to cite, cite the name of the sponsoring organisation or the title of the book or article, for example, Australian Government publishing Service (1994) or Style Manual (1994) or (Here and there 2001). If there is no date, put n.d., for example, Smith (n.d.).;If you are referring to more than one reference, place them in alphabetical order and if you have more than one reference from one author, place them in chronological order. Examples are (Abel 1999 Baker 1990) and Smith (2000, 2001). For multiple citations in the same year use a, b, c... immediately following the year of publication, for example, (Fox 1997a, 1997b)
