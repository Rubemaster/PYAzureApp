NOTES FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR SUPERVISORSby Chad Perry (revised on 3.11.02);A slightly shortened version of this paper has been published as Perry, C 1998, A structured approach for presenting research theses, Australasian Marketing Journal, vol. 6, no. 1, pp. 63 86. An updated, electronic version is available from the author at  cperry1scu.edu.au .;Abstract This paper addresses the problem how should a postgraduate research student in marketing or a similar field (and his or her supervisor) present the thesis? The structure developed provides a starting point for understanding what a thesis should set out to achieve, and also provides a basis for communication between a student and his or her supervisor. Firstly, criteria for judging a PhD thesis are reviewed and justification for its structure is provided. Then writing style is considered. Finally, each of the five sections or chapters and their subsections are described in some detail introduction, literature review, methodology, analysis of data, and conclusions and implications.;Acknowledgments These notes were originally based on ideas of Drs Geoff Meredith, Bert Cunnington and Mike Watkins and also on University of Oregon (n.d.). However, views and errors are the writers own. He has written the paper with a beginning postgraduate research student in mind, and so has presented some positions as starting points for drafting a thesis rather than as the only positions that can be adopted. He thanks Drs Kwaku AtuaheneGima, Robert Brown, Alan Buttery, Gail Craswell, Hank Johnson, Di Lewis, Estelle Phillips, John Roberts and John Rossiter, and Barry Bell, Diana Best, Claudia Hope and Tony Ward for commenting on earlier drafts, and thanks Barry Bell, Len Coote, June Dunleavy, Marilyn Healy, John Jackson, Ben Lyttle, Cec Pederson, Tony Ward and Vicky Schinkel for ideas for some examples.
