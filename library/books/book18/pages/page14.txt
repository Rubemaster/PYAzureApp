14will have to be referred to and Section 1.1 is usually only about one or two pages maximum. For this reason, Section 1.1 is often one of the last sections of Chapters 1 and 2 to be written.;Section 1.1 could use either a field of study approach or a historical review approach. For example, using a field of study approach, Section 1.1 of a thesis about a firms licensing of technology would start with comments about international trade and development, Australias GDP, the role of new product and process development in national economic growth, and then have an explanation of how technology licensing helps a firms new product and new process development leading into a sentence about how little research has been done into it.;An alternative to the field of study example of the previous paragraph is to provide a brief historical review of ideas in the field, leading up to the present. If this alternative approach to structuring Section 1.1 is adopted, it cannot replace the comprehensive review of the literature to be made in Chapter 2, and so numerous references will have to be made to Chapter 2. While the brief introductory history review may be appropriate for a journal article, Section 1.1 of a thesis should usually take the field of study approach illustrated in the paragraph above, to prevent repetition of its points in Chapter 2.;Research problem. Section 1.2 outlines the core or one big idea of the research, starting with the research problem printed in bold or italics on page 1 or 2 of the thesis. The research problem is one or two sentences that cannot be answered yes or no it is the broad problem that the researcher will examine more precisely later in the propositionsresearch issueshypotheses and is the problem prompting and placing a boundary around the research without specifying what kind of research is to be done (Emory  Cooper 1991). As Leedy (1989, p. 61) notes in his thorough introduction to writing research problems, The statement of the research problem must imply that, for the resolution of the problem, thinking on the part of the researcher will be
