28throughout the chapter as the literature survey unearths areas that require researching. Wherever they are presented, they should appear to grow out of the review, even though the student may have decided on them long before while writing very early drafts of the chapter. That is, the development of the research issues or propositions should make it clear that ideas from the parent theories have laid the groundwork for their development by referring to relevant ideas and gaps in the literatures, and make it clear that they are gaps that this research will fill.;When first presented in Chapter 2, the research issues or propositions should be numbered and indented in bold or italics. The concluding section of Chapter 2 should have a summary list of the research issues or propositions developed earlier in the chapter.;Figure 4 summarises the links between the research problem, the parent and immediate theories and the research issuespropositions that were developed above. Note that the figure clearly shows the link between the research problem and the theory that is the focus of its solution.;Chapter 3 Methodology Chapter 3 describes the major methodology used to collect the data which will be used to answer the hypotheses. In some theses, several methods may be used because increasingly authors and researchers who work in organisations and with managers argue that one should attempt to mix methods to some extent, because it provides more perspectives on the phenomena being studied (EasterbySmith 1991, p. 31) and the same position is recommended in PhD theses by Gable (1994). But within the time and other resource constraints of most theses, I consider that there will usually be only one major methodology which suits the research problem and associated research gaps uncovered in Chapter 2. Other methodologies would be used in a secondary role to help formulate research issues (for example, some interviews to help design a surveys questionnaire could be described in Chapter 2 if they help in formulating propositions or in
