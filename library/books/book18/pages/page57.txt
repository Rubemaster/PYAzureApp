The latest issue of Style Manual has a few small changes that necessities the updating of this document. In particular, the parts of a document in Australia can now referred to with capitals, eg Chapter 2, Figure 6.1. As well, there are no capitals after initials in the list of references, there are single quotation marks around titles of papers in the list of references (as well as around titles of other documents like they were in the past), and there is now at last some specific guidelines on how to present the titles etc of figures and tables. I hope I have incorporated them all in this revised paper.
