It is possible to plan the months and pages of a postgraduate research project. As a rough rule of thumb, the five chapters have these respective percentages of the thesis words 6, 34, 18, 22 and 20 percent. Using these approximate percentages, a candidate could plan the time and pages for any chapter. For example, if a candidate plans to do a 50 000 word DBA thesis in 24 months, the planning pages and months for each chapter can be worked out along the lines shown in Table 1. The rule of thumb percentages are slightly different if a thesis has two stages of data collection rather than just the one stage that can be neatly described in a five chapter thesis. In this circumstance, Chapters 3 and 4 would be devoted to the two stages of methodology. Rule of thumb percentages for a six chapter thesis are about 6, 33, 11, 17, 20 and 13 percent. For example, a typical, 65 000 word PhD thesis with two methodologies of data collection done in 27 months might look like Table 2. These two tables are merely examples and are not templates for every thesis, because each research project must do whatever is required to solve its own, justified research problem. The tables measure pages from the start of Chapter 1 to the end of the final chapter and so they include tables and figures but do not include the table of contents, the list of references or the appendices. Note that some months have been added to direct percentage durations for the first and final chapters, for starting and final drafting of the thesis. I have assumed that the margins, the font and the line spacing are those described in Perry (1998), that is, 12 point font and 1.5 line spacing.
