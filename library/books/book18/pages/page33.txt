For example, if a thesis says Smith (1995) referred to the sample size for a multivariate technique, the student must have read Smiths article, or at the very least read an abstract which clearly confirms that Smith did discuss sample sizes in the way the student says Smith did. The final section is the conclusion.;Chapter 4 Analysis of data Chapter 4 presents patterns of results and analyses them for their relevance to the research issues or propositionshypotheses. Frequent summary tables and figures of results are essential, so that readers can easily see patterns in the mass of data presented in this chapter. Tables of statistical data are presented in quantitative research and matrices are used in qualitative research (Miles  Huberman 1985).
