Mean energy in the wind for consecutive 5year periods based on a time series from Hessel, Denmark, 18731982 7.on the studies cited above one can estimate the variation of the mean power from one 20year period to the next to have a standard deviation of 10 or less. The possible effect of the increasing CO2 content in the atmosphere might be a gradual change in the global climate. If this happens, both a change in the magnitudes of climate mean levels and climate fluctuations of the wind energy can be expected. However, as for now, no firm evidence of global change has been given.;The scientific discipline boundary layer meteorology has produced a wealth of knowledge, especially concerning the dynamics of the flow in the atmospheric boundary layer. Below, some of the aspects most important to wind power mete orology are described and the basic equations given.;The behaviour of the natural wind field over flat terrain of uniform roughness and a long upstream fetch is well known both from a large number of field measurements and from theoretical treatments, and a description can be found in any textbook on turbulence 24. The mean wind profile, i.e. measurements of wind speed as a function of height, averaged over periods of 1060 minutes, is often described for engineering purposes by a power law approximation;p (1)where U(z1) and U(z2) are the wind speeds at heights z1 and z2, respectively, and p is the power law exponent, with a typical value of 0.14. A serious problem with this approach is that p varies with height, surface roughness and stability, which means that Eq. (1) is of quite limited usefulness. A more realistic expression for the mean wind speed at height z, with much more general validity, can be
