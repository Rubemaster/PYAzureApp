 Objective measures of terrain ruggedness and complexity. Topographical anal ysis.; Objective measures of the applicability and quality of flow models, in par ticular in complex and mountainous terrain. How much data are needed for flow model verification, and what are proper performance indicators for wind climate prediction.;Much of the work by Ris National Laboratory on wind energy in general and wind energy resources in particular have  since 1981  been supported by the Commis sion of the European Union, DirectorateGeneral for Science, Research and Devel opment. The Danish Energy Agency of the Ministry of the Environment and Ener gy has supported many of the national wind energy and wind power meteorology projects through the EFPprogram. The offshore measurements at the Vindeby site were further sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, the Danish Technical Research Council, and the Danish utility ELKRAFT. The wind data from the Faroe Islands are presented by courtesy of S. P. Heinesen, Landsverkfrdingurin (Office of Public Works), Faroe Islands. Field data on the boom and clamp effects affecting cup anemometers were kindly provided by G. Jensen, Ris. The KAMM modelling was carried out with permission from F. Fiedler and G. Adrian, Uni versity of Karlsruhe. HPF was sponsored by the European Commission through the program Training and Mobility of Researchers. Last, but definitely not least, we would like to thank Dr. L. Kristensen, Ris, for his thorough review of and comments to an early draft of the paper.
