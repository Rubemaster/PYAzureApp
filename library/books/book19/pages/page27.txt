 the roughness length is not constant, but changes with foliation, growth of vegetation, snow cover, sea state and so on. This should be taken into account in any climatological analysis. Landuse information, from which the roughness may be derived, can be extract ed from topographical maps, aerial photographs, satellite imagery, data bases on surface cover, or by visual inspection of the site(s) of interest. In any case, the in formation is usually a snapshot only of the landuse. The sitespecific roughness lengths and changes of roughness can be described in a roughness rose, corre sponding to the upwind conditions in a number of sectors. However, it is much more convenient to record the information in a roughness map and let the analysis model extract the specific information needed 9. Roughness maps can readily be derived from most landuse data bases, in which case an automatic procedure may be set up. This facilitates wind resource assessment over large areas vastly. Coastal land and seascapes, in demand for wind power utilization because of the generally high wind resource, are characterized by large roughness changes at the coastline. Recently, offshore sites have also attracted considerable attention. Prediction of the wind climate in these environments, where relatively few obser vations exist, requires detailed knowledge about the roughness of water surfaces. Offshore conditions present a situation where the flow in many respects differs from that over land. Some of the more significant differences are (greatly simpli fied); The roughness change from land to sea is large and the effect of up stream roughnesses can extend far offshore. The height of the internal boundary layers developing after a roughness change grows much more slowly in stable than in a neutral or unstable conditions, and the general turbulence level is also lower which further decreases the growth rate.
