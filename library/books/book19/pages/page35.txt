Figure 19. Wind power density in Wm2 at a height of 50 m and roughness length z0  3 cm over Ireland calculated by KAMM. Values from a wind atlas analysis by WAsP are shown at the positions of 18 stations.;Figure 20.

Local effects are typically associated with orography, roughness, nearby obstacles, and the presence of other wind turbines. Ris has developed a model which is based on the idea outlined above 90, 91 a diagram detailing the model is shown in Fig. 21. The model is based on NWP predictions from the HIgh Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) of the Dan
