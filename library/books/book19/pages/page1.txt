Abstract Wind power meteorology has evolved as an applied science, firmly founded on boundarylayer meteorology, but with strong links to climatology and geography. It concerns itself with three main areas siting of wind turbines, regional wind resource assessment, and shortterm prediction of the wind resource. The history, status and perspectives of wind power meteorology are presented, with emphasis on physical considerations and on its practical application. Following a global view of the wind resource, the elements of boundary layer meteorology which are most important for wind energy are reviewed wind profiles and shear, turbulence and gust, and extreme winds. The data used in wind power meteorology stem mainly from three sources on site wind measurements, the synoptic networks, and the reanalysis projects. Wind climate analysis, wind resource estimation and siting further require a detailed de scription of the topography of the terrain  with respect to the roughness of the surface, nearby obstacles, and orographical features. Finally, the meteorological models used for estimation and prediction of the wind are described their classifi cation, inputs, limitations and requirements. A comprehensive modelling concept, mesomicroscale modelling, is introduced and a procedure for shortterm predic tion of the wind resource is described.;This manuscript has been submitted for publication in two parts in Wind Energy, published by John Wiley  Sons Ltd. Part I, Climate and Turbulence, covers Sections 14 of the present report and Part II, Siting and Models, Sections 57.
