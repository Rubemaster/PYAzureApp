Figure 23. Predictions and measurements for the Ris mast. Three consecutive Rismodel predictions are shown, the first from 1 October 1997 at 00 UTC, the next at 12 UTC and the third from 2 October 1997 at 00 UTC. For each of the pre dictions, the expected error is also shown by vertical error bars. The measurements are plotted every 10 min.;Figure 23. Predictions and measurements for the Ris mast.

Well undertaken and well described research will help the wind energy community to accelerate progress by avoiding wasting time and effort. The following list of areas of further research reflects our view and therefore can not be complete. A more general view can be found in 95 where the European wind energy research community has put forward a road map for future RD in wind energy. Weather and wind climate; The variability of the wind climate, temporally and spatially, i.e. how much does the expected energy output vary from year to year in different parts of the world.; Disturbed wind and turbulence fields close to obstacles, forests, cliffs etc., modelling and measurements, and their effects on wind turbines.
