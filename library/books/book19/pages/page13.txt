z0    (2)where u is the friction velocity,  the von Karman constant ( 0.4), z0 the roughness length, and  a stabilitydependent function, positive for unstable con ditions and negative for stable conditions. The wind speed gradient is diminished in unstable conditions (heating of the surface, increased vertical mixing) and in creased during stable conditions (cooling of the surface, suppressed vertical mix ing), see Fig. 6(a).;Figure 6. (a) Wind profiles for neutral, unstable and stable conditions according to Eq. (2). The profiles have been matched at 30 m, but represent the same rough ness length. The mean wind speed gradient is very different for the same terrain and hubheight wind speed, but different stabilities. (b) Measured wind profile in very stable conditions with high wind shear (Nrrekr Enge wind farm, nowake situation) 25, 26. Neutralmodel profile is for the same wind speed at 30 m and same roughness length.;In stable conditions, significant changes in wind direction with height are also observed. A wind turbine operating under such conditions experiences both a wind speed shear and a wind direction shear. An example of a largeshear case is given by the measured wind profile from the Nrrekr Enge II wind farm shown in Fig. 6(b) 25, 26. The wind speed at hub height was quite moderate, but the very large shear across the rotor was comparable to the shear found with a hubheight speed of about 30 m s1 in neutral conditions and a roughness length of 0.03 m. This situation gave rise to large loads at the rotation frequency. In fact, we first observed the anomalous loads, subsequently checked the data and then found the large wind shear situation. As another example, typical values of mean wind shear across a 50m rotor at 50m hub height can for low wind speeds in stable conditions be of the same magnitude as the wind shear at very high wind speeds in neutral condition, i.e.;Neutral z0  0.03 m Uhub  8 m s1 U75  U25  1.2 m s1;Stable z0  0.03 m Uhub  8 m s1 U75  U25  4.8 m s1;Neutral z0  0.03 m Uhub  32 m s1 U75  U25  4.8 m s1
