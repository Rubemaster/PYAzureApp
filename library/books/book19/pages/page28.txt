z0  Au2  g (8)where g is the acceleration due to gravity. The value of the constant A is usually quoted as 0.010.04, where the lowest value is for open sea and the highest value is for nearcoastal conditions, see Fig. 15. Recent research 74 has shown that the constant A actually varies by a factor of more than 10 as a function of wave age, i.e. young, developing waves extract much energy from the wind and, consequently, the roughness is high old waves extract much less energy and their roughness is therefore significantly lower.;Figure 15. Calculated and measured offshore roughness lengths as functions of wind speed. Curves for two values of the Charnock constant using Eq. (8) are shown. They represent open sea and nearshore conditions, respectively. The measured roughness lengths were derived from data at a coastal site, Nibe, and a nearcoastal site, Vindeby. Wind directions with upstream fetches over water of 715 km were used in both cases. Roughness lengths were derived from nearneutral data using Iu  1 ln(zz0). Twelve years of measurements from Nibe 75 were used, and one year from Vindeby 76, 33. The high, measured values at low wind speeds are partly due to instationarities and stability effects.;At very high wind speeds, the sea surface roughness approaches that of a smooth land surface. This should of course be taken into account when considering extreme loads, where the turbulence added to the extreme wind speeds will have the same magnitude over land and sea.
