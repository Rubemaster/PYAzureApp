18 RisI1206(EN)reason to believe that the coherences should behave differently over the sea. In complex terrain, however, where we typically see excess turbulence at large scales, one might expect that, like for unstable conditions, the coherences will increase somewhat. The presence of operating wind turbines in the flow have a significant impact on the flow properties close to the rotor (within 10 diameters), see 32, 26, 33, 47; In general, secondorder statistics is quite perturbed inside the wake and the usual boundarylayer approximations for variances etc. become quite different in the nonequilibrium turbulence in the wake.;Examples of changed mean and turbulence quantities are shown in Figs. 10 and 11.;Figure 10. Profiles of (a) standard deviations of wind speed fluctuations and (b) length scales, upwind and 5.3 rotor diameters downwind of an operating wind turbine 26. Hub height is 31 m and rotor diameter 28 m. Averages of 17 half hour series with hub height speeds of 68 m s1 in nearneutral conditions were selected.
