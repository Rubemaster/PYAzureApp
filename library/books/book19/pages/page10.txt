It is in the lowest 100 m  the surface layer  that the logarithmic law for the wind profile and other relations described in the next section apply. The wind profile we observe at any particular time is one measure of the elements of the current weather. If we continue to observe the same wind profile over years, we make up its climatology. It is worthwhile for discussions ahead to reproduce here the generally accepted definitions of weather and climate 21;Weather is the totality of atmospheric conditions at any particular place and time  the instantaneous state of the atmosphere and especially those elements of it which directly affect living things. The elements of the weather are such things as temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity, cloudiness, rain, sunshine, and visibility.;Climate is the sum total of the weather experienced at a place in the course of the year and over the years. Because the average conditions of the weather elements change from year to year, climate can only be defined in terms of some period of time  some chosen run of years, a particular decade or some decades.;The climate varies greatly around the globe. We are not concerned here with other elements than the wind and the wind resource, but note in passing that other climate elements, such as humidity, precipitation, temperature, and also average concentrations of particles, sea spray, etc. would be required for other purposes. An example of this is a Corrosion Atlas, which would be an appropriate thing for a wind turbine designer to have.;Figure 3.
