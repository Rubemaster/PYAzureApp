10.1 SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS GENERATOR 387is rotating at synchronous speed. The speed of the synchronous machine is determined by the frequency of the rotary field and the number of pole pairs of the rotor. The rotor speed n of a synchronous machine is;For the European grid frequency of 50 Hz, a speed of 1500 r.p.m. is obtained with two pole pairs. In the US with a 60Hz grid, the rotational speed is 1800 r.p.m..;Synchronous generators are built as socalled cylindricalrotor machines or as salientpole machines. Cylindricalrotor machines with only a few pole pairs and a rotor with a small diameter are suited to high rotational speeds. In large power plants they are used as turbine generators driven by steam turbines at a speed of 1000 to 3000 r.p.m. Salientpole machines, with a larger number of pole pairs and correspondingly larger diameter, are used in combination with hydro turbines at 60 to 750 rpm. At a speed of for example 75 r.p.m., 40 pole pairs are required. In horizontalaxis wind turbines, sali entpole machines are used as a rule (Fig. 10.3).;The direction of rotation and the rotor speed of a synchronous machine are alwayssynchronous with the rotation of the rotating stator field. Thus, there is no relative field movement (slip) between rotor speed and the synchronous speed of the rotating stator.
