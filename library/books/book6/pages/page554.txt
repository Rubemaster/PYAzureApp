The technical feasibility and reliability of power generation by wind energy can no longer be seriously questioned today. At sites with suitable annual wind speeds the economics are also no longer an issue. Today, these facts must be acknowledged even by the critics of wind energy utilisation.;Supporters of a practically unchanged continuation of the traditional energysupplystructures, therefore, increasingly use the supposed lack of macroeconomic perspective of wind energy, and of renewable energy sources as a whole, as an argument. The re newable energy technologies are praised for their usefulness in certain market niches only to explain in the same breath that, of course, wind and sun could under no cir cumstances replace the reliable, conventional coal and nuclear power stations. The con tribution of the renewables would basically remain restricted to a few percent.;Against this background, the question of the potential of wind energy arises, particularly in the political discussions about future energy sources. This is essentially of no importance to individual users. They will use a technology which has been proven, and is economic, regardless of whether its potential is high or low, as long as the overall economic conditions give them a chance of acting within a useful economic margin. In power economics in particular, however, structural conditions have been set from politi cal points of view and they decide about the economic scope for action by the individual consumer.
