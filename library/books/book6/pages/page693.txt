A central steel tube supported by three legs is called a tripod (Fig. 17.6). Such a de sign, which occasionally also has supports, can be designed as a comparatively light weight and stiff structure. It is, therefore, suitable for greater water depths. As a rule, the three support points are anchored in the sea floor by means of thinner steel tubes (ap proximately 0.9 m diameter). The depth of penetration can be up to 20 m depending on the foundation soil. The stability is thus very high, even on an uneven sea floor.;This type of foundation requires a limited amount of preparatory work on the seafloor. In principle, a tripod foundation can also be constructed on caissons as gravity type foundation. Because of the greater expenditure, however, this solution is usually avoided. The essential disadvantage of the tripod design is the high production expendi ture on land and the difficulty in transporting it. According to current opinion, however, the tripod foundation is a suitable solution for greater water depth, for example in the North Sea.
