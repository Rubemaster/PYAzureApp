REFERENCES 87  sophisticated theoretical modelling concepts are now required as will be described in the next chapter. One more note Some rotor types, for example the Savonius rotor, can be built both as pure dragtype rotors and, with the appropriate aerodynamic shape, as rotors which partly utilise lift. This is one reason for the frequently greatly varying figures quoted for the power coefficient.;1. Betz, A. Windenergie und ihre Ausnutzung durch Windmhlen, Vandenhoek und Rupprecht1926.
