Many smaller turbines do without pitch angle control. Without blade pitching, the pos sibilities of control are very restricted. If a suitable generator system is chosen, the requirements of parallelgrid operation can be met without great difficulty but isolated operation without blade pitch control is a much more difficult task. The fact that wind turbines without blade pitch control do not have an active speed or power control should not lead to the conclusion that all types of control technology are superfluous. Even in parallelgrid operation the operational sequence, the supervision of important functions such as the triggering of safety systems and the synchronization with the grid require a considerable complexity of electronic system control components.;Operation on the grid is the main field of application for turbines without blade pitch control. As a rule, the smaller turbines have a rotor with fixed blade pitch angle and aerodynamic blade tip brakes. An active speedpower control system is not required for parallelgrid operation (Fig. 11.16).
