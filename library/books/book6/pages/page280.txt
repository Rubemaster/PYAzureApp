266 CHAPTER 7 VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICSrotors and wind turbines. The theoretical results were verified mainly with the experi mental MOD0 wind turbine. After several stages of development of the theory and the computer programs, consistency with the measured results seems to be satisfactory.;Very comprehensive multibody simulation codes have been developed and are alsobeen used in recent years (s. Chapt. 6.7.3). Today, with the computer performance available, it is possible to simulate very complex systems including a great number of details 11. The computing capacity seems to be no longer a limit. However, some further critical remarks with respect to the mathematical simulation of the vibrational behaviour of wind turbines are necessary. Under the pretext of a comprehensive simula tion of vibrational behaviour and dynamic loads or instabilities to be derived from these, veritable computer orgies are staged, the practical value of which is frequently in versely proportional to the number of degrees of freedom taken into consideration and of the coefficients in the differential equations.
