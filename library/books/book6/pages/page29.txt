12 CHAPTER 1 WINDMILLS AND WINDWHEELSthe construction and operation of windmills were subject to complex mill laws. Terms such as milling obligation or mill construction ban appear in numerous chronicles of old. Milling obligation prescribed that the inhabitants of a certain area were only allowed to have their grain ground in a mill assigned to them  for a certain levy, of course. This mill frequently was a sovereign mill. The mill construction ban prevented more than one windmill being allowed to be built within a certain area. This restriction often prevented a continued spreading of windmills. In many countries the outdated millright was abolished only as late as 1800 with the invasion of Napoleonic troops. Combined with the introduction of the freedom of trade, these events triggered a new boom in windmill construction. In no other country did windmills achieve as high a significance as in the Nether lands. Apart from the need for grain mills, the draining of land evolved here as the second field of application. The Dutch started to build dikes and to reclaim land in the 15th century. Without the utilisation of windpowered scoop wheels, initially used for draining and then for permanently drying out the volumes of water which kept returning into the newly reclaimed land areas, the Netherlands would not have become what they were in the 16th and 17th century (Fig. 1.11).
