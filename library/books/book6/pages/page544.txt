Apart from differences in elevation in the terrain, the topographical environment of awind turbine is characterized by the roughness of the earths surface and by the pres ence of obstacles. The roughness of the earths surface is brought about by evenly or randomly distributed surface characteristics, primarily by the type of vegetation (forests, meadows etc.) or by the differences caused by land and water. The European Wind Atlas contains extensive notes and computational methods for determining the rough ness length for certain types of surface 4.;While roughness determines the characteristics of the wind regime in a larger area,obstacles only have a limited local significance. Buildings, trees or groups of trees cre ate turbulences which can have highly undesirable consequences for the operation and lifetime of a wind turbine. The flow wake caused by a building is shown in Figure 13.25. The airflow on the leeside of such an obstacle is separated to approximately twice the obstacles height and is more or less turbulent (separation bubble). On the downwind side the disturbed air flow extends to a distance of up to twenty times the height of the obstacle. If a negative influence on the wind turbine is to be avoided, the rotor should be placed at three times the height of the obstacle and sufficiently far away downwind.;The relationship between the orology of the environment and the local wind regimeis extremely complicated. Numerous attempts have been made to develop theoretical modelling concepts and calculation methods 11 (see Chapt. 13.5.3). Practical experi ence and observation also play a not inconsiderable role, especially in this field.
