6.4 DESIGN LOAD ASSUMPTIONS 193this reason, there is frequently a problem of compatibility of the DIBt wind zones with the wind turbine classes according to IEC.; Wind Zone II Normal German inland site (27.6 ms)  Wind Zone III Typical coastal site (32.0 ms)  Wind Zone IV North Frisian islands (36.8 ms) The IEC class 1 forming the basis for the design of wind turbines corresponds approxi mately to Wind Zone IV, IEC Class 2 corresponds to Wind Zone III and IEC Class 3 can be equated with Wind Zone II. The precise differences are deliberately not taken into consideration here since it is hoped that they will soon be a thing of the past in the course of the ongoing harmonisation of standards in Europe as well as internationally.;The socalled normal wind conditions reflect the wind conditions occurring fre quently, i.e. frequently in the course of a year, during the operation of a wind turbine. They are characterized by;The mean annual wind speed at rotor hub height, measured as a 10minute mean value, is the most important parameter for characterizing the wind conditions. With respect to the fatigue strength, it is not only the fluctuation of the instantaneous wind speed about the annual mean value which plays a role but also the longerterm variations of the mean wind speed. Although their associated frequency of load cycles is lower by sev eral orders of magnitude, they still have a certain influence on the fatigue strength. Seen from the point of view of the total load spectrum, they represent transitions from one wind speed class to another. They can be interpreted as longwave, periodic oscillations with large amplitudes.;The vertical wind shear indicates the average change in the mean wind speed with height. It is accounted for by Hellmanns power law with the exponent used being   0.20. The vertical profile of the wind speed is of considerable significance, for example, for the flapwise bending moment if the rotor blades. The high numbers of load cycles
