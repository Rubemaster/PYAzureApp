The tower windmill with its round stonetower millhouse was widespread mainly in the Mediterranean regions. Originally, the windwheel could not be yawed. Later, the wind shaft was supported such that it could be repositioned  with some manual effort  to a number of supporting positions thus providing for at least a rough orientation into the wind. In the eastern Mediterranean regions the medieval tower windmills typically had windwheels with triangular sails (Fig. 1.7). In other regions framed sails were also commonly used. Large tower windmills were built much later. They should rather be regarded as variants of the Dutch windmill and probably developed independently from the Mediterranean type.;The basic idea which led to the design of the Dutch windmill was that which had already triggered the evolution from post windmill to hollow post mill. The intention was to provide the mill with a firm base in order to have better conditions for driving the various machines. It was an obvious solution to build the entire millhouse as a fixed structure and to only allow the roof cap to rotate with the windwheel. This design was a decisive step towards larger and more powerful windmills. The voluminous, fixed millhouse could now accommodate various machines. Apart from scoop wheels, grain millstones, heavy pan grinders for milling dyes and the like, hammering machines and wood saws were also driven by the Dutch windmill.
