Depending on whether the rotor is a downwind rotor or an upwind rotor, the aerody namic yaw moment of the rotor either has an assisting effect or an opposing effect. In both cases, the aerodynamically caused moments around the yaw axis are particularly undesirable, as these cyclic loads fluctuate intensely or even alternate. This is especially true for twobladed rotors with a hingeless hub. This problem is solved almost com pletely by a teetering hub.
