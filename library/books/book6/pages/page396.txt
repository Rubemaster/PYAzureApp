For large wind turbines with a rotor diameter up to 80 or 100 m, it is still possibleunder present conditions to assemble the nacelle in the factory, to transport it to its in stallation site and to mount it completely as a unit on the tower (Chapt. 18.4). This is certainly the most economical method as long as transportation and installation facilities are available. This method will reach its limits with the future generation of wind tur bines with powers of up to 5 MW and nacelles weighing more than two or three hun dred tons.;1. Rybak, S.C.
