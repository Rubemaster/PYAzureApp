330 CHAPTER 9 MECHANICAL DRIVE TRAIN AND NACELLEshafts. The hydraulic actuator works against a strong spring, so that in a breakdown involving the complete loss of system pressure, the rotor blades are forced into the feathered position by the spring, thus causing the rotor to stop. In the larger turbines, the actuators and the hydraulic accumulator for emergency pitch adjustment in case of a failure of the hydraulic units in the nacelle are accommodated inside the rotor hub. Hy draulic pitch mechanisms of this type can be found especially in the older, smaller tur bines made by Vestas.;Regardless of the advance of electrical pitch control mechanisms in recent years,several manufacturers, particularly Danish manufacturers, are still backing hydraulic systems. The design of hydraulic pitch control mechanisms has also been developed further and refined in many aspects. It has been possible to eliminate the tightness prob lems of older systems to a large extent. In addition, the actuators and the control sys tems (valve blocks) have become more and more compact so that the hydraulic drive systems in large turbines could also be accommodated in the interior of the rotor hub (Fig. 9.23). The socalled control or valve blocks, i.e. the valve control system to gether with the control electronics exist individually for each actuator (Fig. 9.24). As special advantages of the hydraulic systems are named
