The frequency generated by the inverter is superimposed on the frequency of the rotating field of the rotor, so that the resulting superimposed frequency remains constant, regardless of the rotor speed. A cycloconverter was selected as inverter for the experi mental Growian turbine. The speed range is determined by the frequency being fed into the rotor. If a cycloconverter is used as inverter, the frequency deviation is restricted to approximately  40  of the nominal speed. Since inverter power increases with the speed range, a considerably smaller range was selected for Growian. The chosen speed range of  15  was primarily intended as speed elasticity to reduce the dynamic structural loads on the wind turbine and to smooth out the power.;The doublefed induction generator can be operated in the over or subsynchronousspeed range, as a motor or as a generator (Fig. 10.31). In the normal operating range, it behaves like a synchronous machine. By controlling the magnitude and phase of the AC in the rotor circuit, any desired reactive or active current can be set, i.e. the generator can be operated with any power factor required.;These different operational modes require a complex control system which is particularly in evidence in the switching and control arrangements for the inverter. On the other hand, the controlled doublefed induction generator combines the operating ad vantages of both the synchronous and the asynchronous machine. Apart from variable speed operation, it offers the special advantage of separate active and reactivepower control. A further advantage of the doublefed generator is associated with the fact that only about a third of the nominal generator power flows via the rotor circuit, i.e. via the inverter. As a result, the inverter becomes much smaller than e.g. in the case of the variablespeed synchronous generator where all the power is converted. This reduces the costs and the loss in efficiency due to the inverter.
