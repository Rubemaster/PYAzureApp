9.8 GEARBOX 359efficiency becomes perceptible only when the load is very small (Fig. 9.50) and it is generally sufficient, therefore, to assume a constant efficiency for calculations of power losses in the drive train.;Even if only a very small part of the lost power is emitted acoustically, the noiseemission of gearboxes should not be underrated. In many cases where there are com plaints about unacceptable noise produced by the wind turbine from residents living nearby, the gearbox turns out to be the cause of the annoyance. The use of lownoise gearboxes or possibly of appropriate sound absorbers is of considerable importance if wind power is to find wide acceptance in public.;The noise emission of a gearbox depends on its quality and naturally on its size. Thequality of design and manufacturing is the main cause of the considerable range of sound power levels experienced. Gearbox manufacturers generally indicate the sound pressure level, measured at 1 m distance under test conditions according to DIN. The following approximate values are to be expected
