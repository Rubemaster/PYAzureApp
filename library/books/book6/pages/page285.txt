 breaking strength related to the specific weight, the socalled breaking length (km)  modulus of elasticity related to the specific weight, (103 km)  allowable fatigue strength after 107 to 108 load cycles (Nmm),  Cost of the material, manufacturing cost and the cost of the development involved are also significant. Of course, the last two items cannot be judged solely from the material pointofview but must be seen in relation to the selected design concept. Table 8.1 provides an overview of the parameters listed above. The traditional aircraft material aluminium does have suitable material properties, but the production techniques  Table 8.1.
