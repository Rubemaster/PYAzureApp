The mass of the structure is less by up to 40. In spite of the more complex assembly, this results in a cost advantage. This amounts to 10 to 20  compared to tubular steel towers depending on the height. With increasing height the cost advantage be comes more relevant.;Transportation by road has reached its limits with tubular steel towers of 100 m length and tubes with diameters of more than 4.5 m. They can no longer be transported by truck on many roads whereas disassembled lattice masts can be moved to any desired site.;The much longer assembly time on site and the greater expenditure for maintenanceare considered as disadvantages of lattice towers. These arguments are certainly valid but the question remains as to what extent this would influence the economic viability of the investment quantitatively. Available experience has not yet provided any reliable values in this regard, because the numbers and the life time of the existing wind turbines with modern lattice towers do not yet provide a sufficient statistical basis.;One of the highest tower of a wind turbine to date with 160 m was built for the prototype of the Fuhrlnder W2E in 2006 near Magdeburg in Germany. The structure, devel oped by the company SeeBA, consists of special hollowsection steel rods which are joined using highstrength extension bolts (Fig. 12.21). Very high lattice towers are feasible on remote sites, where heavy lifting equipment is not available or cannot be placed without negative consequences for the environment, for example on sites in a forest.
