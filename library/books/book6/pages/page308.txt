A decisive step towards reducing rotor blade weight, but also with a view to reducing manufacturing costs, was the introduction of the socalled crossbolt connection in rotor blades. This design principle has been common practice in helicopter rotors for a long time. Rotor blades developed by the German company MBB (now EADS) for various test turbines were the first to be equipped with this advanced connection tech nology (Fig. 8.23). This design has since found its way also into commercial rotor blade production, one proviso being the use of epoxy resin composite material, as polyester is prone to plastic deformation when a high load is concentrated on one point. A well known Scandinavian furniture manufacturer uses a similar connecting process for their inexpensive selfassembly furniture, which is why this connecting technique is occa sionally also referred to as IKEA Joint.
