The sensors are mounted on top of or on side arms of a mast or a tower. The mast heightdepends on the requirements to be met. If only a comparison with the data in the wind maps is intended, then the standard measuring elevation of 10 m is enough. With larger wind turbines, the problem then arises of having to extrapolate the wind speed to the rotors hub height. If there are too many uncertainties concerning wind shear, nothing remains but to build the wind measuring mast as high as the rotors hub height. However, a wind measur ing mast with a height of fifty or more meters represents a cost factor and may require a building permission (Fig. 13.28).;As the size of the wind turbines increases, measuring the wind at rotor hub height byusing an anemometer mast becomes almost impossible. The operator must rely on other methods. Occasionally, special radar methods are used today for determining the wind velocity at a greater height, for example SODAR (Sonic Detecting and Ranging).;In the past, mechanical anemographs were used which plotted wind speed and direction on a paper strip. Mean values were determined with the help of a plotting rule. Nowadays, electronic recorders are used almost exclusively where the measured data is stored on tape or in chips. This provides for immediate data evaluation by computer. The manufacturers offer an almost endless variety of suitable storage devices and ana lysers.;In recent years, specific data loggers, sometimes called wind classifiers, have beendeveloped especially for wind turbines. They count the duration of the wind speed within certain speed ranges (classes) and thus provide direct information on the wind speed frequency distribution (Fig. 13.29). Moreover, it is possible to obtain additional information on instantaneous wind speed or the average wind speed reached in the past month or the like.
