Logging the wind speed distribution, and thus also the average wind speed, over ayear by using such a data logger, in combination with longterm wind data which may be available from neighbouring areas, represents a useful basis for obtaining a reliable assessment of the energy yield of a wind turbine. Wind classifiers can thus supply valu able information for a wind turbine operator. However, they are no exclusive substitute for longterm wind statistics.;The wind speed is indicated in meters per second in the SI system of units. Despitethis, the Beaufort scale of wind forces is still widely used in many places, and is per haps also more graphical (Table 13.30). Above all, the correlation between wind speeds and visible effects is a valuable aid to assessing the wind regime, especially for a wind power technician.;Table 13.30. Classification of wind speed according to the Beaufort Scale
