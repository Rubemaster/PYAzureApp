Rotor blade thickness is a subject in the classical conflict between aerodynamic effi ciency and rotor blade stiffness and strength requirements. The aerodynamicist strikes for the thinnest possible rotor blades, so as to be able to use highperformance airfoils. In contrast, structural requirements demand a sufficiently thick crosssection for the loadbearing elements. The maximum thickness, in particular, which is provided by the height of the spar box and influences the section modulus of the spars or spar box cross sections to the third power, is the crucial parameter for meeting the stiffness require ments at a low structural weight. These two requirements of good aerodynamics and sufficient stiffness run counter to each other. The only possible optimum lies in offset ting the penalty for the structural weight against the differences in energy yield. For this reason, the task of the aerodynamic designer is restricted to showing the influence of thicknesstochord ratio on rotor performance and energy yield (Fig. 5.55).
