In some older national standards such as, e.g. at the Germanischer Lloyd, the gusts;In some older national standards such as, e.g. at the Germanischer Lloyd, the gustsare also still calculated with a gust factor. The positive gust is defined as;The gust amplitudes exceeded with a probability of once annually (normal operating gust) are defined as 9 ms. Gusts which are exceeded only once in 50 years (extreme operating gust) are defined to have an amplitude of 13 ms.;Extreme changes in wind direction within a range of seconds can cause extraordinary loads. According to IEC 641001, extreme changes in wind direction within 6 seconds are calculated in dependence on the standard deviation of the turbulence and on the rotor diameter. They are to be specified as annual and 50year events.;The load assumptions must take into account an extreme crosswind profile as a 50year event. This requires the assumption of an asymmetric rotor inflow produced within a period of 12 seconds both in the vertical direction (vertical wind shear) and in the hori zontal direction. The shear to be assumed is calculated in dependence on the turbulence, the rotor diameter and the rotor hub height.;6.4.5 Other Climatic and Environmental lnfluences;Climatic parameters and environmental influences other than wind can affect the loads acting on a wind turbine. The limits are specified in the IEC 641001. The essential impacts are;The verifications of strength should be carried out for a temperature range of 10C to 40C, In the case of special operating conditions (e.g. Arctic climate), the appropri ate individual verifications must be made.
