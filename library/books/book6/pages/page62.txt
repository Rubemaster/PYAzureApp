In the eighties, the statesubsidised and stateinitiated programmes for developing the wind energy technology were primarily orientated towards the construction of large experimental turbines. Apart from political motives, the opinion prevailing initially that the large utilities should be the potential buyers of these turbines was a decisive argu ment for concentrating on the development of wind turbines in the Megawatt power range, a development which came much too early from todays point of view. The large experimental turbines were built almost exclusively by large and wellknown industrial companies since only these were able to develop and build projects of this magnitude from a standing start, as it were. The names read like a Whos Who? guide through industry Boeing, General Electric and Westinghouse in the US, MAN, MBB, Dornier, Voith in Germany or Kvaerner in Sweden.;The development began in the United States. From 1975 to 1987, a series of largeexperimental turbines designated MOD0 to MOD5 were erected and tested (Figs. 2.18 to 2.22) and a number of duplicates were built of some of these, e.g. of MOD0 and MOD5.The programme started with the 100kW Mod0 design, which was built by several manufacturers at different sites, followed by one unit of the MOD1 and three units of the MOD5, having a rated power of 2.5 Megawatt. The last design was the MOD5 on the island of Hawaii.
