The wind turbines are connected to a central transformer substation via their own trans former (Fig. 17.13). In this substation, the lines from the wind turbines are brought together at a central point and the energy is transformed to high voltage. Apart from this task, the substation contains the necessary switching panels and other electrical facilities such as, for example, powerfactor correction systems. The highvoltage transformers are normally oilcooled. The switching panels must be gasinsulated (SF6).;At greater distances and with higher powers, the energy must be transmitted to the mainland at highvoltage level. The voltage must be transformed to the next higher level (110 to 150 kV). Highvoltage threephase cables are generally available and their struc ture does not differ from mediumvoltage sea cables (Fig. 17.14 and Table 17.15). Cer tainly the costs are higher and range between 800 and 1000 US per metre including the laying.;The energy transport to land raises the question of redundancy. In most cases the cable connection to land incorporates a capacity of two times the rated power of the wind park. For example a 300 MW wind park will be connected with four 150 kV cables,
