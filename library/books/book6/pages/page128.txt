 The operation of wind turbines without blade pitch control is restricted primarily toparallel grid operation on a fixedfrequency grid. Isolated operation requires additional technical equipment (s. Chapt. 10.3.8).; Last but not least, the rotor must be prevented from runaway in the event of a loss ofthe generator torque. For safety reasons, this requires aerodynamically effective brakes at the rotor blades, in addition to a mechanical rotor brake.;Smaller turbines with a rotor diameter of up to about 20 m, and in some cases also with larger diameters, often have fixedblade rotors, the power input of which is restricted by aerodynamic stall at a certain wind speed. This type of design has been perfected espe cially by Danish manufacturers (Fig. 5.26), the threebladed rotor with fixed pitch angle being a characteristic feature of the Danish Line. The provision of aerodynamic brakes to limit overspeed is absolutely mandatory for rotors with fixed blades. A large variety of spoiler designs are known from aircraft but wind turbines use almost exclu sively adjustable rotor blade tips (Fig. 5.27). Spoilers which disappear into the blade profile when retracted are no longer in use today (Fig. 5.28). They are not very effective and are at least as complex in terms of construction.;In principle, other types of air brakes which increase the aerodynamic drag can alsobe used. Some test turbines even used parachute brakes which were ejected from the blade tips in the case of an emergency shutdown (NEWECS45). Such brake systems are obviously out of the question for commercial operators as their operation is too impractical. In wind turbines with active stall control, the complete rotor blade are used for braking (as with blade pitch control) (s. Chapt. 5.5.3).
