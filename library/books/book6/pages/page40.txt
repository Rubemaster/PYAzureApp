Danish government which was looking for ways of supplying also Denmarks rural areas with electricity, La Cour built an experimental wind turbine driving a dynamo in 1891 (Fig. 2.1). The remarkable fact is that he also at once tackled the problem of energy stor age. He used the direct current generated by his wind turbine for electrolysis and stored the hydrogen gas thus produced. From 1885 to 1902, gas lamps using this method illumi nated the school grounds in Askov.;As far as the wind wheel was concerned, La Cours electricitygenerating wind turbine strongly followed the model of the traditional windmills. Although he was well aware of the advantages of aerodynamically shaped windmill sails, he used a rotor with four shutter sails. He knew that this technology could be managed much better in the country.;In the subsequent years La Cour expanded his activities in Askov to establish a wellequipped test station for wind turbines. He was possibly the first to carry out tests in a wind tunnel, which he had built himself, and he set up a second, larger test station in 1897. In his book Porsogsmellen, published in Copenhagen in 1900, he reported on this work 3. In 1903 La Cour founded the Association of Danish Wind Power Engineers (DVES) which, among other things, offered training courses for wind electricians.
