18.8 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR 785local loads or non uniform fullwidth engagement of the tooth profiles and mixed frictional conditions manifest themselves on the tooth profiles by easily visible areas of grey appearance. It is an important task during the routine gearbox inspections to iden tify these areas. Massive toothedwheel damage due to extreme overloads will occa sionally lead to the tooth profile breaking out (Figs. 18.55 and 18.56).;Data on the causes of faults and repairs of wind turbines have been systematically col lected and analysed since the beginning of the nineteeneighties. From the first ten years of wind energy utilisation, these data are primary analyses from Denmark and from the United States. In Germany, the operational results of a representative number of wind turbines have been collected since 1990 in a Scientific Measuring and Evaluation Pro gram (WMEP  Wissenschaftliches Me und Evaluierungsprogamm) and evaluated from the most varied points of view 11. It covers the causes and effects of faults and the reference to the components affected in the wind turbine (Figs. 18.57 and 18.58). Evaluation of the fault causes shows that, apart from the system control area, the component defect, not specified in greater detail, causes about two thirds of all faults.;This evaluation highlights the operational reliability of wind turbines but does notprovide any information about the actual repair risks. For example, malfunctions in the electrical and control area can often be eliminated by very simple measures and fre quently even by the mere push of a button. The real repair risk only becomes apparent on evaluation of the repair costs (Chapt. 19).
