206 CHAPTER 6 LOADS AND STRUCTURAL STRESSESas a load spectrum. Against this background, calculating the endurance strength re quires more complex models which can also be summarised under the title of damage accumulation.;The load spectrum summarises the stress situation of a component over its entire lifein an idealised form. The load sequence within an operating cycle of the wind turbine, which the component has passed through a certain number of times within its life, forms the basis for the load spectrum. The progression of the cyclic bending moment experi enced by the rotor blades of a wind turbine in the individual load cases serves as an example (Fig. 6.23).;According to the load case definition, operation under load is composed of five loadcases, each characterised by a certain wind speed. During the startup and shutdown process, the rotor blades are subjected to a higher load level as the blade pitch angle is set such that the dead weight bends around the flapwise axis. This condition has been assumed as occurring with a certain frequency in the lifetime of the wind turbine.;In fullload operation the amplitudes of the bending moment around the chordwiseaxis are determined primarily by the dead weight of the rotor blades. The influence of wind shear can also be recognised clearly but it must be noted that an extreme wind shear has been assumed. The effects of wind turbulence on the chordwise bending moment are only slight. It is the flapwise bending moment that is primarily affected. Naturally, the weight of the rotor blades in relation to the aerodynamic forces plays a decisive role in this.
