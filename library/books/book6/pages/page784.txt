18.7.2 Risks from Extreme Weather Conditions;Apart from the plantrelated technical operational safety considerations, external influ ences can result in safety risks. These are primarily meteorological phenomena. Al though these influences are largely taken into consideration in the load assumptions, damage which is of significance to the operational safety may occur in extreme cases.;Depending on their respective basic wind turbine class, or on the wind zone, wind turbines are designed for a maximum permissible wind velocity (s. Chapt. 6.4.1). In wind class 1, the maximum wind velocity is assumed to be 60 ms (326 kmh). This wind velocity is normally not exceeded even in hurricanelike storms. However, this assumes that the systems of importance for the maximum wind loads like pitching the rotor blades into feathered position and correct alignment of the turbine into the wind direction are working. Experience has shown that a combination of technical defects and extreme wind velocities has occurred in some cases, nevertheless, and wind turbines were destroyed in heavy storms (Fig. 18.48). For example, in extreme weather conditions, abrupt changes in the wind direction will occur which cannot be followed quickly enough by the yaw control system, or a fault occurs in the control system which is not absorbed quickly enough by the safety systems. As happens in other systems, too, it is in most cases an unfortunate coincidence of a number of events which then lead to an accident.
