                  where LW  sound power level DI  factor of directivity K0  steradian factor DS  factor of distance DL  factor of atmospheric absorption DBM  factor of ground and meteorological absorption DD  factor of vegetational absorption DG  factor of absorption by buildings DW  influence of wind Both, the VDI Standard cited and related literature, contain information as to how these parameters can be derived from the conditions on site. If several sound sources, for example the turbines of a wind farm, contribute to the sound pressure level generated at one location of immission, the noise levels generated by the wind turbines are calculated individually and the acoustic energies are added. The total sound pressure level gener ated (LAZ) is obtained from the formula;15.2.2 Noise Sources in Wind Turbines;The sound power level of a wind turbine is emitted by various sources. The total sound power level measured is determined by aerodynamic noises, primarily emitted by the rotor, and by various types of mechanical noises. The different noise sources must be identified during the development and analysed carefully. Every potential source re quires special attention in order to achieve a design with low noise emission overall.
