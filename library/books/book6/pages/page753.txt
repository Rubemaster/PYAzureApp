The transportation and assembly of turbines will acquire a completely new dimensionwith the next generation of turbines of the 4 to 5 MW class. The technical design will have to be increasingly assessed and determined from the point of view of transportabil ity and erectability on site. The location of the production sites in relation to the final location of the turbines will also play a role. If the tower is a steel shell tower, it is generally manufactured and transported in sections (s.a. Chapt. 12.4.2). The most critical section with respect to its transportation is the bottom section. In the case of a 100 m tower, its diameter is already over 5 m so that this section can scarcely be transported by road in one piece. The only way out is manufacturing it in halfshells which must be welded together at the installation site (Fig. 18.20). In some cases, the tower is also manufactured in one piece in the plant, up to a certain height. If the conditions are favourable, a tower having a length of up to 80 m can thus be transported also in one piece.;Under current conditions, the problem of transportation and erection on site is considered as an essential criteria for the economic use of wind turbines in less developed areas, i.e. mainly in the Third World. In complex terrain such as a mountainous region, this determines the upper economic limit to the size of a wind turbine. However, one should be aware of the fact that the conditions that are valid today will change with the increasing use of wind turbines. Access roads and large hoisting equipment become
