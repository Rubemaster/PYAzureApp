On this basis, some institutes produced in 1999 some longterm forecasts for the operating costs and, in particular, for the repair costs to be expected. In its survey, the Ger man WindEnergy Institute (DEWI  Deutsches WindenergieInstitut) suggests that 65 to 70  of the mechanical parts by value must be replaced, i.e. exchanged or repaired within a service life of twenty years 12. This value is generally considered to be too high since the prognosis was made in favour of the wind turbine operators during the discussion about payment for power before the Renewable Energies Law was passed. Other experts predict a requirement for replacement of 30  of the machine costs after the tenth year of operation 13.;Assuming, for instance, the gearbox and the bearings of the rotor blades and the generator have to be replaced after ten years, this will result in about 20  of the machine costs. Calculating further repair expenditure of about one percent of the turbine costs per annum over the entire life of twenty years, this comes to a proportion of about 30  by value of the turbine costs. This order of magnitude comes closer to reality and re flects the state of the art which has been achieved at present. It must be taken into con sideration, however, that the existing stock of installed turbines also includes many older and smaller turbines. After what has been said before, the replacement of rotor blades, gearboxes and blade bearings is not at all mandatory and will become more and more improbable in future as the technology matures.;1.
