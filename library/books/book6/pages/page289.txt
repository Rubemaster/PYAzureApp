8.3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS OF ROTOR BLADES IN THE PAST 275presentday solutions is only reached if the errors  or better the disadvantages  of the wrong turns taken in the past are understood.;Duralumin, used in aircraft construction, is a highstrength material with which a weight advantage of approximately 30  can be achieved against comparably loaded steel designs (Fig. 8.3). The good fatiguestrength values and resistance to corrosion are of advantage. For lightweight stressedskin designs made of duralumin, the buckling strength of the skin panels is the dimensioning criterion, as a rule. Its decisive disadvan tage lies in costly production. Duralumin sheets and stringers are practically not weld able and must, therefore, be riveted. In aircraft design, where weight is the factor which dominates everything, this labourintensive production method is tolerated, but it is considered too expensive for the rotor blades of wind turbines. Nevertheless, rotor blades made of duralumin, fashioned exactly as in aircraft engineering, did get tested in a few test turbines (Fig. 8.4).;A possible alternative to using duralumin would be a design with less strong butweldable aluminium, for example AlMg5. However, there would no longer be a weight advantage compared with steel, due to its much lower fatigue strength. Moreover, the shielded arc welding of aluminium sheets is labourintensive. Altogether, aluminium rotor blades do not seem particularly promising at the present. This could change if rotor blades were to be produced in very large quantities and the use of elaborate pro duction machinery permitting economical mass production were to become viable.
