762 CHAPTER 18 WIND TURBINE INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONturbines anemometer will be checked and, if necessary, calibrated. This provides the basis for testing the operational sequence of the yaw control system. The operation of the mechanical rotor brake and of the blade pitch mechanism can also be checked with the rotor at standstill.;In the second phase, the operational characteristics of the running wind turbine without being connected to the grid will be checked. Rotor speed will then be increased in crementally and the speed control will be tested. Rotor startup and shutdown can also be tested. The emergency shutdown of the rotor by fast pitching of the rotor blades, or with the aid of the aerodynamic brakes, will initially be triggered by hand and will sub sequently be left to the automatic safety system.;When this function is satisfactory even during a gusty wind regime, operation under load can be started. Power will be increased incrementally up to the rated power and operation is then extended up to maximum operating wind speed. At this early stage of loaded operation, extensive reliance will already be placed on the automatic systems especially since, in any case, power control only works with the automatic systems. In this phase, the rotor emergency stop must be verified at maximum power and higher wind speeds. Some points on the power curve will also be measured as far as possible within the available time.;Table 18.38.
