14.7.8 Efficiency of a Wind Turbine as Energy Converter;The significance of the various parameters relating to the energy yield of a wind turbine becomes especially clear to understand, as well as appealing, when a comprehensive balanced overview is considered. The graph shown in Figure 14.44 is intended to serve this purpose.;In this diagram, the energy content related to the rotorswept area is plotted againstthe wind speeds of a basic frequency distribution of wind speeds. Based on the kinetic energy content of the wind speeds and their proportion of the annual energy yield, the first sectional area represents the nonusable wind energy due to the physical principle of wind energy conversion into mechanical energy. This loss cannot be avoided.
