The decisive document with regard to the load assumptions is the IEC 614001 standard Safety Requirements. The statements contained in the following chapters are, there fore, an excerpt from IEC 614001.;On the basis of the IEC standards numerous socalled certification organizationsoffer an independent certification service for wind turbines. They also consider to a certain extent inhouse or national standards for some aspects of the design or for the load calculations. The most important classification organizations, which grant certifica tions for wind turbines are;The guidelines of the Germanischer Lloyd (GL) are of particular importance in Ger many but some other European countries are also working with these guidelines or are using the certification by the GL. The rules are more detailed than those of the IEC in some aspects and also comprise rules for the mathematical methods to be used. From the point of view of content, there are some differences to be noted. For example, the intensity of turbulence to be assumed, which forms the basis of the load cases, is differ ent. Whilst the IEC is assuming turbulence intensities of 1518 , the GL guidelines require 20  overall. However, these and some other small deviations are about to be corrected.;Next to the Germanischer Lloyd, Det Norske Veritas (DNV) is the second international classification company which has its origin in shipbuilding. The DNV has also issued Guidelines for the Design of Wind Turbines. In principle, the same applies as for the GL guidelines, i.e. there are still some deviations from IEC 614001 in detail.;Besides the IECstandards some national standards are still in force, particularly thestandards in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. They play a role in the national building permissions. Some regulations of the national standards are not included in the IEC standards.
