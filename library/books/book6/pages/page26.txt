By the middle of the 19th century, Dutch windmills started to develop into powerful prime movers with a remarkable range of applications. At this time their external shape was also refined with regard to aerodynamics and they became the dominant windmill type both technically and economically in several variations, for example the Dutch ground mill or the gallery mill (Figs. 1.8 and 1.9).
