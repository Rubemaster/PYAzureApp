Fig. 1.3. German post windmill in the 15th century.       (Deutsches Museum);It is interesting to note that the windmill types which evolved in the course of history were able to maintain their original forms, coexisting with each other right up to the present time. Even the archaic verticalaxis windwheels of the Orient have not entirely disappeared. In Europe, the more powerful Dutch mill was not able to displace the simpler post windmill. It seems that the considerably cheaper post windmill was the more economical solution, as long as it was only a matter of milling grain in relatively small amounts. Against this background, a look at the technology behind the various windmill types is quite rewarding.;The post or trestle on which the entire millhouse rests and around which it revolves is the main feature of the post windmill (Fig. 1.4). The trestle consists of a central main post which is braced by four diagonal quarter bars. It extends upwards into the millhouse to about half its height where it is joined to the socalled meal beam which supports the millstone (Fig. 1.5). The meal beam divides the millhouse into an upper level, the stone floor, and a lower level, the meal floor. The wind wheel, which commonly had four sails, is mounted in the upper part of the millhouse. The slightly inclined wind shaft supports the largediameter cog wheel. The cog wheel drives the spindle or upright shaft via the smaller horizontal spindle gear or
