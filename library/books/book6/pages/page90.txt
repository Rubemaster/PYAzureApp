74 CHAPTER 3 BASIC CONCEPTS OF WIND ENERGY CONVERTERSthe cylinder jacket, the wind flows tangentially into the interior of the duct where it forms a tornadolike air vortex. Due to the low pressure in the vortex centre, air is sucked in from the bottom of the tower into the duct from the outside, thus driving a turbine with a diameter which is about a third of the tower diameter. However, this principle has only been examined in the wind tunnel so far. Applying it to a real, full sized wind turbine would probably meet with considerable problems, for example noise emission. The conclusion drawn by theoretical assessments of this design concept is that the power coefficient related to the maximum planview swept area of the entire structure reaches values of only 0.1 5.;Concentrated air vortices occur as socalled boundary vortices in the flow around an aircraft wing. This occurs to a particularly high degree with delta wings with large angles of attack. Attempts have been made to utilise this effect for wind energy technology. The wind rotors are mounted on a static structure in the shape of a delta wing so that they work in the boundary vortices of the delta wing. A reliable theory for this complex case was not available but theoretical estimates led to the hope that the power yield would increase by a factor of 10, compared to a rotor within a conventional free air stream. In the end, the result of model measurements in the wind tunnel turned out to be so disappointing that the project was cancelled 7.;The Technical University of Berlin has proposed and investigated another variant of wind concentrator with the name of Berwian (Fig. 3.7). A fixed stator wheel with a number of blades generates a strong vortex in the centre of the concentrator. The six to eightfold increase in wind power is utilised by a small wind rotor in the centre of the stator
