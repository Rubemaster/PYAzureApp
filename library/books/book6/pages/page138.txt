The most common airfoils in aviation have been compiled in airfoil catalogues 20.Selecting an airfoil, however, requires first of all knowledge of airfoil classifica tion. The first systematic airfoil developments for aircraft were carried out as early as 1923 to 1927 at an aerodynamics research institute in Germany (Aerodynamische Ver suchsanstalt in Gttingen). Airfoils from the Gttingen airfoil system are scarcely used today. They were replaced later by the American NACA airfoil series which is charac terized by the following parameters (Fig. 5.35);The contour coordinates are listed as tables in the airfoil catalogues. NACA airfoils are indexed with a multi digit code containing data on the airfoil geometry and partly also on certain aerodynamic properties. The most important airfoil families are
