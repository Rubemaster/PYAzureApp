14.5.4 Safety Deductions for Economic Calculations;The calculated forecast for the energy yield to be expected is of great significance for the economic assessment of the wind turbine at a certain site investment project. The banks providing the finance and the investors, therefore, demand a certain safety deduction from the calculated annual energy yield. Neither can this demand be rejected off hand, keeping in mind the factors influencing the energy yield discussed in this chapter. Before arguing about the appropriateness of a safety deduction, however, one must visualize the background on which the forecast is based. According to experience, there are consider able differences involved. A generous safety deduction is visually attractive, but not worth very much if the forecast is already based on unsafe assumptions. A systematic check of the bases for the forecast should answer the following points and the associated questions;Taking into consideration technical losses has nothing to do with safety deductions. It is necessary to consider the socalled parking efficiency in cases of wind park siting, and the electrical transmission losses to the grid which occur in every case.;The assumption of a realistic technical availability should also be included in the discussion of an appropriate safety deduction. As discussed in Chapter 14.5.4, wind turbines achieve high availability values today but values above 98  should not be suggested.;This field contains the greatest uncertainties. Several independent expert wind assess ments are, therefore, generated for the larger investment projects. This raises the ques tion whether a mean value should be used in the case of several different results or if the worst assessment is used for calculating profitability. An additional question is to what extent the theoretical assessments can be confirmed by empirical values, particularly from neighbouring wind turbines. In Germany, wind forecasts according to the WASP
