The protective measures against the hazard of flying chunks of ice simply consist ofan ice warning system which automatically switches off the turbine if ice accretion is to be expected due to the prevailing weather conditions. Such systems are being offered by the turbine manufacturers as supplementary equipment. Deicing systems on the rotor blades would be much more expensive but are available from some rotor blade manufac turers as an optional extra (Chapt. 2.9).;Just like any other technical system, wind turbines must be serviced regularly and, in the case of defects, repaired. In wind turbines the conventional components of mechani calelectrical energy conversion such as shafts, bearings, gears and generator require maintenance similar to that with other technical systems. The type and interval of main tenance work required should be contained in the turbine manual. The general question is whether wind turbines require an extraordinary level of maintenance or whether they are often in need of repair. There are two reasons why this could be so;The ambient conditions of a wind turbine are unusually tough. Not only are wind turbines exposed to wind and weather over a service life of at least 20 years, but their preferred sites close to the coast where the air is salty also provide ideal conditions for corrosion on all metal components. A further reason is the comparatively high number of operating hours achieved by a wind turbine over the period of its service life. The effective operating period of a wind turbine at a good site is about 5000 hours annually,
