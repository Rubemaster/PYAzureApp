More recently, the trend to ever higher towers at inland sites has increasingly placed the hybrid construction into the foreground of interest. Cantilevered tubular steel towers of more than 100 m height are scarcely transportable so that either lattice towers or hybrid concretesteel constructions are used. These towers consist of slender, mostly prestressed, concrete parts in the lower region and of tubular steel segments in the upper region (Figs. 12.27 and 12.28).;The design and construction is more complex, but some important advantages areachieved. The lower mass of the steel part in the upper section reduces the increase of mass with height and the eigenfrequency of the tower does not decrease in the same way as it is for a pure concrete construction. The dynamic characteristics of hybrid towers with more than 100 m height, are more favourable. It is possible to build rela tively stiff towers with heights up to 150 m and more.;Fig. 12.27.
