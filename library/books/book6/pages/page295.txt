(Fig. 8.10). The design derived from traditional wood constructions. The experience gained with these was not too bad after a trial run which, however, was only short 5. Nevertheless, the development was not pursued further. Problems were seen in, among other things, the durability of wood with regard to rot and the associated, neces sary maintenance and, apart from that, wood composites appeared to be the better alter native (s. Chapt. 8.3.5).;8.3.4 Previous Designs with FibreReinforced Composites;Components of fibrereinforced composites have been widely used for a number of decades. It was thus an obvious step, even at the beginning of modern wind energy technology, to use this material also for the construction of rotor blades. The basic concept of fibrereinforced composites consists in reinforcing the well known synthetic resins by embedding fibres in them which have better strength proper ties than the basic material, so that these cheap plastics also meet more stringent demands. The historic development of this material technology and the associated de signs and production methods took two different paths. At the end of the 50s, high quality fibrereinforced composites were developed in aviation and later also in aerospace engineering and in vehicle construction. This development was driven especially by the demand by the aerospace industry for
