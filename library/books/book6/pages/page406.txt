In contrast to a DC machine, it is very difficult to make an induction machine changeits speed. It is possible to influence the speed within a very narrow range by increasing the terminal voltage. By connecting external resistors in the rotor circuit, the speed can be varied at least in one direction by increasing slip. This, however, requires a slipring rotor. The rotational speed of a squirrelcage rotor can be changed in steps by means of pole reconnection. This requires the stator winding to have two separate windings with different numbers of pole pairs, a version which is occasionally used in induction gen erators for wind turbines (Chapt. 10.3.4).
