Fig. 19.5. Prototype of the twobladed wind turbine Aerodyn SCD, 3MW, rated power 3 MW, rotor diameter 100m, spec. towerhead mass 15 kgm;In comparison with the threebladed rotor, the calculated specific structural masses for the twobladed line and their increase with increasing size were distinctly lower, even though there was an overlap depending on the specific design features. The calculated masses are not fully confirmed by the few practical examples of the lighterweight twobladed line of designs (Fig. 19.5). They were heavier than predicted by theory. The reasons for this may have been the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical model, on the one hand, which still exhibited many features of improvisation in the development stage used. On the other hand, these turbines obviously do not yet fully exploit the design potential for decreasing weight and costs.;The full lightweight potential of the twobladed line only can be exploited with an effective load compensation system for the rotor (see Chapt. 6.8.2 and 6.8.4). This is indispensably for a twobladed rotor to reduce the extreme pitch and yaw moments on the drive train and the tower, if the optimum weight shall be achieved. As soon as this technology will be available the two blade line will have a future at least for applica tions where noise emission does not play a role for example in offshore areas. In princi ple the twobladed concept has the greater potential for reducing the manufacturing costs, but it needs some efforts in the further development.
