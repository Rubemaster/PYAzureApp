112 CHAPTER 5 ROTOR AERODYNAMICSwhich in most cases do not have blade pitch adjustment. At higher wind velocities, the rotor power is only limited by the aerodynamic stall occurring at the rotor blades.;Using this type of passive stall control requires carefully designed rotor blade geometry and carefully selected rotor speed. To ensure that at a certain wind speed, the flow does indeed separate so that an increase in power is effectively prevented, the rotor must be generally operated at a speed below the aerodynamically optimum rotational speed.;Wind rotors of this type are designed in such a way that their aerodynamic power input decreases above a wind velocity of about 15 ms (Fig. 5.25). The power rises again theoretically at much higher wind velocities but the turbines are no longer in operation at these wind speeds. The rotor is braked to a standstill or furled and spins freely at low speed without capturing any significant amount of power. However, for this Danish design to be practicable, a number of preconditions must be met; The strength and stiffness of the rotor and the entire turbine must be relatively high inorder to withstand the high aerodynamic loads. Lightweight designs present problems under these circumstances.; The installed generator power must be comparatively high so that the generator does notlose synchronization with the grid in the event of strong wind gusts (s. Chapt. 9.1).; The rotor should have a good startup torque as there is no favourable starting positionfor the blade pitch. Twobladed rotors with fixed blade pitch angle must be brought up to speed electrically.
