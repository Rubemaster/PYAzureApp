As the electricity supply of the rural areas no longer presented a general problem,plans were made in the USA to deploy large wind turbines within the public utility grid, interconnected to conventional power plants. The American engineer Palmer Cosslett Putnam (Fig. 2.17) must be given the credit of being the first to implement these plans. In 1940, he approached the S. Morgan Smith Company, a water turbine manufacturer in York (Pennsylvania), with his concept and some ideas of the technical design of a large electricitygenerating wind turbine. Morgan Smith entered into a contract with the Cen tral Vermont Public Service Company concerning the erection of a wind turbine based on Putnams plans.;Palmer C. Putnam won over renowned scientists and technicians of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to cooperate in this project. Among others, Theo dore von Karman was responsible for the aerodynamic design of the rotor. In October 1941, the turbine was installed on Grandpas Knob, a hill in the state of Vermont. It was the worlds first really large wind turbine as proven by the technical data (Fig. 2.10); 53.3 m rotor diameter,  1 250 kW rated power,  35.6 m tower height.;The twobladed rotor with stainlesssteel rotor blades was positioned downwind fromthe lattice tower. The rotor blades were connected to the rotor shaft via flapping hinges in order to reduce the dynamic loads caused by wind gusts. The speed and power output of the wind turbine were controlled by an hydraulic bladepitching mechanism. Electric ity was generated by a synchronous generator with 1250 kW rated power.;This structural weakness at the blade root had in fact been detected by technicians atan early stage, but, due to a lack of funding, no preventive repair was carried out. The later repair was also not carried out for the same reason and the turbine was disassem bled.; rotor diameter 175  225 feet (53.3  68.5 m),  tower height 150  175 feet (45.7  533 m),  generator power 1 500  2 500 kW.
