Furthermore it is common practice to agree with the bank upon one or two years free of repayment. Summing up the capital service over the period of the loan there is only a small difference compared to the annuity method, so the average values of power production costs do not depend very much on the kind of repayment.;As soon as specific figures are available for these parameters, a simple static calcula tion of the achievable power generation costs should mark the beginning of every analysis of the economics. This is the only way to show the objective potential of the technology to be assessed. More complicated dynamic calculations of the economics are indispensable for longterm investment decisions, but they necessarily introduce numerous speculative elements into the calculation. The result is then determined not only by the economic potential of the investment itself, but also by the assessment of certain overall economic conditions and their evolution over a relatively long period.;In many cases, the problem of economics is not one of direct inquiry into the costs ofpower generation but of calculating the repayment or amortisation period of the invest ment with a given revenue from power generation. This situation exists almost always when the energy produced is fed into the grid. Calculations must then be based on exist ing electricity rates stipulated by legal regulations or power purchase contracts. The calculation of economics is the same as in the case of calculating power generation costs, except that the repayment period is derived indirectly from predetermined power payments.
