6.5 OPERATIONAL STATUS AND LOAD CASES 199be loaded up to the limits of the strength of the material or of the component stiffness if it is intended to keep the building masses within tolerable limits. High building masses decrease the stiffnesses and increase the forces of gravity. The attempt to compensate for the associated increased loads by using higher safety factors, in turn creates a vi cious circle at the end of which the structural safety is lower instead of higher. In the case of dynamically highly stressed systems, which undoubtedly includes wind turbines, the structural safety can lastly be achieved only by greater understanding of the loads involved and of the structural dynamics (s.a. Chapt. 6.7.2).;For a machine with moving parts, the condition of the loaded system is a decisive crite rion for the stresses occurring during the loads acting on it from the outside. The load cases in the narrower sense are, therefore, produced by connecting the external condi tions with the operating states of the wind turbine. In this context, it is not only the oper ating states per se which must be considered but also other states which may occur within the entire life cycle of the product. States which become special load cases may occur during transport and assembly, and possibly also during large repair processes. On the other hand it would be nonsensical, however, to produce such states which then become the dimensiondetermining load case for the components. For economic reasons, the load cases should be restricted to those which are absolutely necessary. These are the operating conditions and the abnormal occurrences which can be expected with a certain probability.;The basic structure of the link between external loads and operating conditions andthe structural stresses to be expected in it becomes clear in Table 6.20.;Table 6.20.
