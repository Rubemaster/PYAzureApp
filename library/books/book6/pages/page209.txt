The parameters depending on the wind turbine class are contained in Table 6.18.;To determine the maximum loads on the wind turbine, extreme wind conditions must be stipulated. These comprise shorttime extreme wind speeds and also the loads result ing from extreme changes in the wind direction and the vertical shear in the wind speed, and certain combinations of these influences. The continual nature of the turbulence is covered with the statistical approach to turbulence during normal wind conditions so that the extreme events can be assumed deterministically to be single events.;  0.75  where z is the hub height.;Gusts occurring with increased frequency in operation are called extreme operatinggusts. They are calculated from the turbulence model in dependence on the rotor diame ter according to IEC.;To account for the turbulence distributed over the rotorswept area and unevenly, asocalled coherent turbulence function is also stipulated according to the IEC stan dard. The extreme coherent gust is to be assumed to have a speed of 15 ms. Beyond that, it is to be combined with a uniform change in wind direction within 10 seconds.
