The test site shall show only minor variations from a plane and shall be free from larger obstacles. The wind turbine under test and the wind measuring mast shall not be influ enced by neighbouring wind turbines. If the test site shows significant deviation from a plane and includes obstacles a site calibration is recommended to quantify the flow distortions for all wind directions.;Measuring the correct wind speed is a key element in determining the wind turbines power curve. The first task is to find a suitable position of the meteorological mast. The physically correct correlation of power and wind speed can only be carried out success fully with a wind speed representative of the generated power. For this purpose, the rotors flow field must influence the site of the wind speed measurement as little as possible, so that the true undisturbed wind speed can be recorded. However, due to the necessary spatial distance from the rotor of several rotor diameters in front of the rotor plane, there is a time delay between the instantaneous wind speed measurement and the power output of the wind turbine. The IEC standard recommends a layout ac cording to Figure 14.12.;Fig. 14.12. Position of the meteorological mast for measuring the power curve of a wind turbine according to IEC 610012 2.
