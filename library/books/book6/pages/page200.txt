6.3 SOURCES OF LOADING 185factors to be expected. The frequency of occurrence is also to be seen in connection with the mean wind speed and the gust factor (Fig. 6.16).;Figure 6.17 shows the effect of wind turbulence on the specific dynamic load situationof a wind turbine. Bending deflection in the rotor blades was initially calculated taking into account only the influence of the cyclic disturbances in the flow caused by wind shear, tower influence and similar parameters, but ignoring turbulence. Including the tur bulence spectrum, the deflection values are almost doubled.
