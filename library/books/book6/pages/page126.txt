In unfavourable free stream situations there is thus a risk that the rotor blades will ap proach stall conditions, particularly in the critical outer areas, due to the wider pitch angle there. This is the reason why the MOD2 turbines exhibited a certain power instability with high turbulence, a shortcoming which initially could only be eliminated by making compromises in the control system which reduced power output. Later on, socalled vor tex generators were installed in the outer blade area which improved stall characteristics (s. Chapt. 5.3.4). Another disadvantage of partialspan pitch control is the poor startup torque of the rotor. Practical experience with the MOD2 has confirmed that the rotor accelerates relatively sluggishly. Another variety of partialspan pitch control is represented by the aileroncontrolled rotor where the idea is to control the wind rotor in a similar way to aircraft wings which are con trolled by ailerons. This concept was considered as an alternative to adjusting the blade tip, particularly for very large rotors such as the former MOD5A project of the General Electric Company 14. However, this method requires a complicated control system with posi tive and negative aileron deflections in order to achieve power control comparable to that with fullspan pitch control. So far, no practical experience with aileroncontrolled rotors has been available.;5.3.2 Passive Stall Control with Fixed Blade Pitch;The flow diagrams shown in Figure 5.18 have already shown that, even without adjustment of the rotor pitch angle, aerodynamic stall will occur with increasing wind velocity and with the tangential velocity of the rotor kept constant. It is this passive, selfregulating mechanism for controlling the power input of the rotor which gives stall control its practical significance, especially for small turbines
