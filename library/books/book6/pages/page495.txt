The towers of small wind turbines are of much simpler construction. In some cases,existing tubular elements from other applications can be used for the manufacture. Up to tower heights of about 15 m, the tower is climbed from the outside (Fig. 12.18). In some countries, special work protection rules and insurance requirements must be observed with respect to an external ascent so that there is a trend to provide a safe internal ascent even in relatively small turbines.;In the initial years of commercial wind energy utilisation, lattice towers were widely used in small turbines (Fig. 12.19). As their sizes increased, tubularsteel towers in creasingly displaced the lattice towers. Recently, the interest in lattice towers has been rekindled, particularly in connection with large turbines with a hub height of 100 m and more.;The main argument used against the lattice towers, which were initially widely used,was the reference to their ugliness. Considered more objectively, this objection is not as a clearcut as it appears. Closeup, the lattice structure is not so pleasing to the eye
