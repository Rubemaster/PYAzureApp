216 CHAPTER 6 LOADS AND STRUCTURAL STRESSESthe dynamic response to these external loads. When the rotor is rotating, the moment of inertia changes during a rotor revolution in relation to a fixed axis when the rotor only has two blades, i.e. behaves like a rotating rod. Whereas rotors with three or more blades behave like a disk as far as the moment of inertia is concerned, i.e. are symmetri cal in terms of mass, the mass of the rodshaped twobladed rotor is asymmetrical and its moment of inertia has a pulsating profile during a revolution. Depending on whether the rotor blades are perpendicular or parallel to the axis under consideration, the mass moment of inertia varies from a maximum to a minimum value. This phenomenon has serious consequences with respect to the dynamic re action of the rotor during excur sions from its normal position.;If an asymmetrical wind flow, for example in a horizontal rotor position, causes a deflection of the rotor blades, the resultant angular velocity around the vertical axis is com paratively small, as the moment of inertia of the rotor about its vertical axis is large in this position. If the rotor continues to turn towards the perpendicular, the moment of inertia about the vertical axis reduces. Since, for physical reasons, the rotational momentum is maintained, the angular velocity around the vertical axis becomes all the greater. The consequence is a dynamicallycaused yaw moment about the vertical axis. This dynamic moment of reaction reinforces the aerodynamic yaw moment already existing from the asymmetrical flow. The pitching moment, triggered, for example, by the asymmetrical flow to the rotor due to shear wind, is thus reinforced in a twobladed rotor.
