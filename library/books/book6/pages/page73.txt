After the energy crisis in 1973, there was only one country in which there was a certain tradition of successfully operating small wind turbines for power generation and this was Denmark (s. Chapt. 2.1). The basic technical concept had been developed in the nineteen forties and had found relatively wide application, although this was still mod est by todays standards.;Compared with todays commercial units, the first wind turbines gaining any numerical importance in this field of application were still comparatively small with an output of 50 to 60 kW and a rotor diameter of 15 to 16 m (Fig. 2.41). In 1986, the contribution made in this way to Danish power generation was still less than one percent, but rose steeply in the following years. In Denmark, the wind turbines were not only operated by individual users of electric power. Many turbines or small groups of turbines were built and operated as community installations by consumer associations. This made it eas ier to organise their financing and operation and the legal regulations in Denmark pre sented no obstacles to this way of supplying oneself with electrical energy.
