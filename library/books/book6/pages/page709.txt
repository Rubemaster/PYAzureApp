700 CHAPTER 17 OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY UTILISATIONof the turbines compared with the current state of the art. Early fault detection is just as important as a strategy of preventative maintenance so that this work can be per formed when the weather conditions are favourable. The aim must be to maximise the MTBF (mean time between failures). Strategies and technical measures suitable for this purpose must still be introduced in the wind energy industry.;More farreaching ideas provide for the use of telecontrol systems. It is hoped thatthis technology will make it possible to carry out at least simple maintenance and ad justment work from land. In any case, the overall logistical concept will be of decisive significance for the commercial utilisation of offshore wind energy.;Developing an integrated logistics concept which, starting with the production sites,covers everything from stock keeping and transportation facilities to methods of provid ing for accessibility in rough seas and poor visibility will be of decisive significance for the economic viability of the offshore operation of wind turbines in the future. The longterm expenditure for operating costs will depend on this to a high degree and will thus, lastly, also be a question of investments in the logistical means.
