Mid 2011 a capacity of nearly 3000 MW was operational distributed to about 30 off shore wind parks in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (Fig. 17.34, Table 17.35). A fur ther batch of approx. 2500 MW is under construction and will be commissioned in short time (mainly in 20112012). The by far greatest share is the capacity in UK, followed by Denmark and Germany.;The offshore wind energy potential has been estimated with some hundred thou sands Megawatts in several relevant studies. But one can argue that a theoretical poten tial is something different as real projects. Many projects far out in the open sea will probably fail because of a lack of economic viability (s.a. Chapt. 19.4). Other projects are nudging the limits of licensing and disappear again from the planning list, causing new sites to enter into the discussion. In addition, the periods required for implementa tion should not be underestimated. Even if the practice of licensing has clearly made progress in the meantime, there are also technical and economic factors preventing a rapid implementation in many cases.;The expansion of the offshore wind energy capacity is tied up with the decisive questionof producing the required cable routes and linking the routes to the mainland grid. The routes are not yet finalised but there is largely agreement to combine the wind parks in the North Sea to form clusters so that only a few major routes will be necessary. The first route was commissioned at the end of 2007 for the Alpha Ventus and for some other projects
