The oldest design of wind rotors features rotors with a vertical axis of rotation (Fig. 3.1). At the beginning, however, verticalaxis rotors could only be built as pure dragtype rotors. The Savonius rotor, which can be found as ventilator on railroad carriages or delivery vans, and the cup anemometer used to measure wind velocity are wellknown examples of rotors with a vertical axis of rotation.;It was only recently that engineers succeeded in developing verticalaxis designswhich could also effectively utilise aerodynamic lift. The design proposed in 1925 by the French engineer Darrieus, in particular, has been considered as a promising concept for modern wind turbines (Fig. 3.2). In the Darrieus rotor, the blades are shaped and rotate in the pattern of a surface line on a geometric solid of revolution, a troposkien (i.e. turning rope in Greek), with a vertical axis of rotation. This makes the geometric shape of the rotor blades complicated and thus difficult to manufacture. As is the case with horizontalaxis rotors, Darrieus rotors are preferably built with two or three rotor blades.
