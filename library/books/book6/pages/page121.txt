At high wind speeds, the power captured from the wind by the rotor far exceeds the limits set by the design strength of the rotor structure. This is especially true of large wind turbines as the safety margins of the strength limits of the components become narrower with increasing turbine size. In addition, the power output of the rotor is lim ited by the maximum permissible power of the generator. Figure 5.17 shows the extent to which the power input of the rotor increases when it is not subject to intervention by a control system. Apart from limiting rotor power at high wind speeds, there is the problem of maintaining rotor speed at a constant value or within predetermined limits. Speed limitation becomes a question of survival when, for example during a grid outage, the generator torque is sud denly lost. In such a case, rotor speed would increase extremely rapidly and would certainly lead to the destruction of the turbine unless countermeasures were taken immediately. The rotor of a wind turbine must, therefore, have an aerodynamically effective means for limit ing its power and its rotational speed. Basically, the driving aerodynamic forces can be reduced by influencing the aerody namic angle of attack, by reducing the projected swept area of the rotor, or by changing the effective freestream velocity at the rotor blades. Since the wind speed cannot be influenced, the effective freestream velocity at the rotor blades only changes with the rotor speed. The rotor speed can, therefore, be used as a correcting variable for control ling power, provided the wind turbine permits variablespeed operation. However, the
