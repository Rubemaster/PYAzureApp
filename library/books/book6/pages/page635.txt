626 CHAPTER 15 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTin recent years. Firstly, observations made with the existing experimental MOD0 and MOD2 turbines were systematically evaluated. This revealed that, in contrast to the reception of radio signals, the reception of television signals was indeed disturbed. Ex periences with individual wind turbines differed with regard to the intensity of the inter ference and the distance from the wind turbine.;In the vicinity of the MOD1 turbine in Boon (North Carolina), about 30 householdsat distances of up to two kilometers were affected. Less interference was found with the MOD0 wind turbines, for example on Block Island near New York. Evaluation of these observations and the subsequent systematic investigations carried out with the experimental NASA MOD0 turbine in Plum Brook showed that the interference with television signals could essentially be attributed to two causes (Fig. 15.14).;The direct signal from the television station can be disturbed by the rotating rotorblades if the wind turbine is positioned directly in line with the receiver. This effect is strongest in the UHF band. The second, far less significant interference is created by the wind turbine reflecting the direct signal, so that receivers situated at the corresponding angle of reflection receive a second, unwanted signal. This effect, which is also pro duced by other large buildings, causes the familiar ghost images in analogue television which flicker when the rotor is turning. It also occurs when the rotor is not turning but is absent in digital television.;After this experience with the first large experimental wind turbines, the problem ofinterference with radio and television signals was examined with numerous other wind turbines. The results differed greatly. The differing intensities of the interference effects were attributable, on the one hand, to the technical concept of the wind turbines and, on
