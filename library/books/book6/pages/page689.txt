In 1995, the Germanischer Lloyd issued the first recommendations for the design ofoffshore wind turbines 4. In Denmark, design guidelines for offshore wind turbines were also published in 2000 5. These standards are being continuously updated within the framework of IEC 614002 6.;Compared to locations on land, the offshore siting of wind turbines makes much higher demands on their technical equipment. For example, it is not clear at present to what ex tent the redundancy of certain functions must be increased in order to achieve the required reliability that is an economic necessity in view of the more difficult accessibility. The measures necessary for ease of maintenance in offshore use will only become known in prolonged use. The first generation of offshore turbines differs from the onland versions especially in the following features
