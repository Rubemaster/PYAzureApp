There is the occasional suggestion of implementing pumped storage power stations,as they are in use by utilities as peakload power stations, in combination with wind turbines. However, building pumped storage plants only to improve the utilisation of wind power is entirely out of the question from an economic point of view. Pumped storage plants have specific investment costs of more than 5000 USkW. In other words under current conditions even water is an economical energy storage medium only if the preconditions are particularly favourable, or if the wind energy can be inte grated into a supply concept which includes the storage of water in any case.;The use of socalled compressedair energy storage (CAES) power stations for storing wind energy has been discussed for some years, especially in conjunction with the grid problems becoming apparent during the expansion of the wind energy capacities in the North Sea (Fig. 16.3). Similar to that of pumpedstorage power stations, the implemen tation of compressedair storage is tied to the existence of natural or manmade storage facilities for the compressed air. The underground caverns produced by salt mining are particularly suitable for this purpose. One such power station exists in HuntdorfLower Saxony since 1978 and is used for equalizing the grid loading for a nearby large power station 7. The air is compressed to approx. 50 70 bar with the aid of air compressors driven by gas turbines and is stored in a salt deposit. Using this energy, the power sta tion can deliver about 290 MW over a period of about two hours if needed. A similar power station has also been in operation in the US since 1991.;Fig. 16.3.
