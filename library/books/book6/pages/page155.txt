In the isolated rotor theory (blade element theory) the blade part near the hub is ofless significance for the generation of power. This leads to the conclusion that, aerody namic aspects can be put aside in favour of higher strength or greater simplicity in manufacturing. This applies primarily to airfoil thickness, providing for more construc tional depth for strength and stiffness along with minimum weight. However the lower contribution by the root area to power generation must not lead to the mistaken idea that, to save weight or costs, this part of the blade can be dispensed with without any noticeable consequences for the power generated. Figure 5.49 shows the influence on the power coefficient when different sections of the blade root area are omitted.;In the recent years some wind turbine developers did not rely on the isolated rotorblade aerodynamics. They investigated the flow around the nacelle and its influence on the root sections of the rotor blades (see Fig. 5.9). The so far most striking example are the Enercon turbines. The root section of the blades is constructed with a large chord length echoing the ideal shape, including the air flow around the nacelle into the calcu lations. In the given circumstances, this shape contributes to a noticeable increase in the power coefficient (Fig. 5.50). However, this effect is closely linked to the aerodynamic shape and the large crosssection of the nacelle. Both features lead to an extraordinary acceleration of the vortexfree flow around the nacelle which also affects the free stream velocity at the blade roots so that this area also becomes more significant aerodynamically.
