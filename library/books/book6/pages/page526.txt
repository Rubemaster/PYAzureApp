In contrast to the average of 4.6 ms on land the offshore average is 8.6 ms. This means that, on average, the offshore wind speed is about 90  higher than the inland one. How ever, this information is generally only of limited significance to individual cases where actual landoffshore reference site figures are of importance.;Figure 13.10 shows the global offshore areas of the great oceans. It is noteworthy;Figure 13.10 shows the global offshore areas of the great oceans. It is noteworthythat there are considerable differences from summer to winter. In winter, high wind speeds occur mainly in the Northern hemisphere, particularly in the North Atlantic, the North Sea, but also in the Northern Pacific. These regions are, therefore, of particular significance for offshore wind energy utilisation. In the summer months, the region with high wind speeds shifts to the Southern hemisphere where wind energy utilisation can scarcely be considered under current conditions.
