Generally, a prototype will be commissioned during the development of a new type ofturbine under the responsibility of the manufacturer alone. In the case of very large tur bines, however, it may be necessary to hand over immediately to an operator. In addition, the certifying organisations and the licensing authorities are involved. Table 18.38 shows the acceptance tests agreed for the delivery of the experimental MOD2 turbines to the Bonneville Power Administration in the United States.;All wind turbines are designed for automatic operation. It is a must for commercial applications. With a power output of a few megawatts at the most, labour costs for per manent operating staff would be economically prohibitive. Although a certain amount of operator intervention is still required, e.g. for the commissioning, for monitoring and for maintenance purposes, the automatic monitoring systems are of special importance with respect to operational reliability because the wind turbines are normally being run without operating personnel.
