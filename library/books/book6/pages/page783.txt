774 CHAPTER 18 WIND TURBINE INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONthe high centrifugal forces acting on the rotating blade tips. Moreover, the visual effect at night would certainly not be uncontroversial. Rotating circles of light in the night sky would not meet with undivided approval in the long run. The hazardwarning lights used for nighttime marking are generally red flashing omnidirectional beacons or also rotat ing flashing lights (Fig. 18.47). For the reasons mentioned above, special procedural regulations have been issued for wind turbines. These specify that hazardwarning lights are only required on the nacelle roof. It is only when the rotor blade tip projects past a maximum height of 150 m that day time marking in the form of the redorange markers on the blade tips is required.
