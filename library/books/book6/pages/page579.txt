The power curve specified by the manufacturer guarantees the power yield of the wind turbine under the conditions described and specified in the measuring process according to IEC 6140012. Beyond that, however, the power of a wind turbine is also influenced by certain factors at the actual site. This fact, which cannot be argued away, is often a cause of conflict between manufacturer and operator. To estimate the siterelated influ ences is the task of technical project planning which, if possible, should include the manufacturer. Whether the manufacturer will guarantee the power curve on site in this case is another question which should be agreed from case to case.;Experience in recent years has shown that the guaranteed power curve can be noticeably affected by environmental influences in difficult terrain (Fig. 14.15). It is especially the increasing siting of wind turbines in mountainous and wooded inland regions which has shown a distinct deviation of the actual annual energy yield achieved from the expected value, resulting in numerous disputes regarding the validity of the power curve issued by the manufacturer.
