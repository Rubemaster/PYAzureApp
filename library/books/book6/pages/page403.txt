390 CHAPTER 10 ELECTRICAL SYSTEMhowever, imply that a generator rotating as fast as possible is the most economical solu tion. As the generator speed increases, so does the complexity and cost of the gearbox. The task is to find the optimal combination of generator speed and gear ratio.;In the induction machine (or asynchronous machine), an electric field is induced by a relative movement (slip) between the rotor and the rotating stator field which produces a voltage across the rotor winding. The interaction of the associated magnetic field of the rotor with the stator field results in the torque acting on the rotor (Fig. 10.7).;The rotor of an induction generator can be designed as a squirrelcage rotor or, withadditional slip rings, as a slipring rotor (Fig. 10.8). The slipring rotor allows the elec trical characteristics of the rotor to be influenced from the outside. By changing the electric resistance in the rotor circuit, greater slip can be attained and with it a degree of speed compliance for direct coupling to a fixedfrequency grid. If an inverter is used in the rotor circuit, it is possible to achieve variablespeed operation in parallel grid opera tion.;Like synchronous generators, induction generators can be operated both as motors andas generators. The induction version is widespread among electric motors. Almost all modern electric motors are induction machines. The squirrelcage versions, in particular, stand out because of their unrivalled robustness and low maintenance requirements. Apart from the rotor bearings, they have practically no rotating, wearing parts and, more over, their priceperformance ratio is advantageous.
