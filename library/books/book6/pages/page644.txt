The consequences shall be demonstrated at the example of Germany. Power generator contributes more than 40  of the total amount of emissions (Fig. 15.21). In 2006 the wind energy capacity existing in Germany generated power to the amount of 30.5 billion kWh, i.e. 30.5 TWh, corresponding to a contribution of 5.6  to the genera tion of electricity. Using the above relation, it can be easily calculated that the emission of 26 megatons of CO2 was avoided by the wind turbines in Germany in 2006. Com pared with the total emissions of 885 megatons in 2006, this corresponds to about 3.;A detailed study of the expansion of power generation from wind energy shows thata capacity of 48,000 MW can be expected to exist in Germany by 2020 21 (it should be mentioned that all forecasts about the expansion of wind energy have been greatly surpassed by reality in the past). Assuming that this figure of 48,000 MW is actually achieved for the year 2020, this means a share of not quite 15  in the electricity generation in Germany. The CO2 emission saved would then be about 70 megaton per annum which is still about 10  of the predictable total emissions in 2020 and an addi tional annual reduction of 44 megatons compared with the present level.;The significance of this contribution of the utilization of wind energy to the prevention of CO2 emissions becomes clear when compared with road traffic 22. In 2006, motor vehicle traffic had an 11.9  share in the CO2 emissions in Germany, corre sponding to an amount of approx. 100 megatons of CO2. If the average emission of pollutants by cars were to be reduced from 162 g per 100 km (2004) to the 120 g per 100 km aimed at by the EU, this would correspond to a saving of 25 megatons. This means that this aim, hotly discussed in public circles, would bring a reduction of only slightly more than one half the CO2 reduction compared with the expansion of wind energy utilization forecast.
