The fibre composites also include a special wood composite type of construction which has favoured by some manufacturers in the past and which still is of interest. The initia tive for using wood composites came from boatbuilding. In their efforts to make wood resistant to seawater, the boatbuilders developed a wood composite design in which the wood was completely embedded in epoxy resin similar to the glass or carbon fibres. This made it possible to eliminate a significant disadvantage of oldfashioned wood designs and to continue to make use of the good properties of wood, particularly its fatigue strength.;Rotor blades of this type had already been successfully tried out in 1980 on the experimental American turbines of the MOD0 series (Fig. 8.17). The connection to the hub was designed by means of simple studs which were bonded into the blade root structure. This was an advantage and lightweight design compared to the heavy flange connection of the blades commonly used in these days. But it proved to be unreliably, obviously due to less experience at this time. In the Eighties, rotor blades in wood composite technol ogy are used in numerous wind turbines. The English turbines of the former Wind En ergy Group (WEG), for example, had rotor blades of this type.
