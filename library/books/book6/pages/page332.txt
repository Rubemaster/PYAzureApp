The rotor hub is the first component of the mechanical drive train. Although it is a part of the rotor, however, it is closely associated with the mechanical drive train in terms of function and structure. In pitch controlled wind turbines, the hub includes the compo nents of the blade pitch mechanism and in twobladed rotors it often has a teetering or a flapping hinge to compensate for the unfavourable load conditions. In this way it be comes a complex system and represents a significant feature of the technical design of the wind turbine.;The rotor hub is one of the most highly stressed components of a wind turbine. Allrotor forces and moments are concentrated here almost in a point. Its material must therefore be selected with the greatest care with respect to fatigue life. This involves an extraordinary amount of detailed work for the strength calculations and dimensioning in order to avoid local stress concentrations.;In the past, all three variations could be found in wind turbines. In the course of time, the cast steel hub has become generally accepted.
