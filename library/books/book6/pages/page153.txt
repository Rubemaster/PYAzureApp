138 CHAPTER 5 ROTOR AERODYNAMICSrotor with a design tipspeed ratio of 10. On the basis of the optimum aerodynamic shape, a hyperbolically delimited trapezoid was chosen as the basic shape. For charac terizing the geometrical rotor blade shape, some parameters wellknown in aircraft technology have been introduced which are defined as follows;One problem with these definitions is how to determine precisely the blade planform area and the chord length at the tip and the root. One makes do by somewhat vaguely determining the aerodynamically effective blade area or chord length.;Fig. 5.46.
