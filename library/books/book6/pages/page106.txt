Betzs simple momentum theory is based on the modelling of a twodimensional flow through the actuator disc (s. Chapt. 4). The airflow is slowed down and the flow lines are deflected only in one plane (Fig. 5.1).;In reality, however, a rotating converter, a rotor, will additionally impart a rotatingmotion, a spin, to the rotor wake. To maintain the angular momentum, the spin in the wake must be opposite to the torque of the rotor. The energy contained in this spin re duces the useful proportion of the total energy content of the air stream at the cost of the extractable mechanical energy so that, in the extended momentum theory, taking into consideration the rotating wake, the power coefficient of the turbine must be smaller than the value according to Betz (Fig. 5.2).
