In Growian, the critical inside area of the spar could be checked in parts, as the rotor blade spar was accessible over almost half of its length. Some other steel spars were provided with special crack warning arrangements. For this, the spar box or tubular spar was lightly pressurised with gas. A drop in pressure or a change in flow velocity indi cated the presence of a crack.;From the presentday point of view, steel is no longer a realistic alternative as material for the rotor blades of wind turbines. The heavy weight alone is clearly against it. Using steel was more of a temporary solution for the first large experimental turbines. Regardless of this general assessment, steel is found in some rotor blades of todays very large turbines. In the Enercon E126 the inner sections of the rotor are made of steel (s. Chapt. 18, Fig. 18.31).;Although wood has a tradition of centuries as a material in the construction of wind mills, its use in modern wind energy technology was considered to be more of a retro grade step. Nevertheless, there were some attempts of making rotor blades of wood. Solid wood construction as found in aircraft propellers can still be found today on small windwheels with a diameter of only a few meters. Moreover, the natural wood material is almost unbeatable with respect to fatigue strength. This fact was very well known to the old builders of windmills but had been largely forgotten today. In Denmark, the experimental turbine NibeB was equipped with wooden rotor blades in 1980
