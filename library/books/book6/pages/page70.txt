In the United Kingdom, the 3MW LSl by Windenergy Group and the HWP55 turbine by the Scottish Howden Company can be mentioned (Figs. 2.35 and 2.36) and in Hol land, the NEWECS45 was tested (Fig. 2.37).;A further generation of European experimental turbines, taken into operation towardsthe end of the eighties, was less ambitious with regard to dimensions, and was of smaller scale throughout. In contrast to the first units which were produced in national programmes, these systems were developed and tested in a coordinated EU pro gramme. They were promoted by the EU Commission in two large research and demon stration programmes Joule and Thermie 25.;The development programmes WEGA I and WEGA II were set up with the expressaim of bringing the large wind turbines in the megawatt range closer to being used commercially. In the WEGA I programme, the experiences gained from the existing test installations in the EU were evaluated by an international group of experts and the basic conditions for the development of new systems were formulated (Figs. 2.38 and 2.39). The theoretical background was formed by a fundamental study in which the relation ships between plant size, production costs and economic viability had previously been analysed 26. Initially, the European wind turbine manufacturers were slow to begin developing commercial systems of this size. The risk was thought to be very high, the Growian experience still being fresh in most memories. But in the end, the EU initia tive was adopted so that the systems sponsored in the WEGA programme formed in some cases the direct starting basis for the first commercial systems of the megawatt class (Fig. 2.40).
