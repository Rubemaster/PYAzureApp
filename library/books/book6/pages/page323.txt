9.2 PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS 309because assembly and erection have to be carried out within a short time depending on the weather and sea conditions.;Many basic solutions there are to the problem of transmitting power from the rotor to the electric generator, but their implementation in large wind turbines is restricted in practice to only a few designs. In experimental concepts, turbines were tried out in which the generator was mounted in the tower instead of in the nacelle. Although these solutions have some indisputable advantages, they did not succeed in commercial wind
