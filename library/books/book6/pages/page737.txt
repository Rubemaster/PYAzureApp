728 CHAPTER 18 WIND TURBINE INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONfrom a certain wind speed on, all turbines are in operation. From this speed on, which lies above the rated wind speed specified for a single wind turbine, all units will operate at rated power and the array efficiency is then 100 .;These effects lead to a difference in the power curves between the interferencefreesingle wind turbine and the turbine array. In addition, the array power curve also de pends on the wind direction (Fig. 18.3).;In addition to its positive effect of replenishing the wake more rapidly, the turbulence caused in the array by the wind turbines also has the negative effect of increasing the turbulence intensity by a not inconsiderable amount with regard to the fatigue load spectrum. This induced turbulence generated by the wind turbines themselves is added to the natural turbulence on the site. As already mentioned in Chapter 5.4, this effect essentially depends on the distance from the rotor, i.e. on the spacing of the turbines of a wind park array, apart from the turbine characteristics. With a given turbulence intensity on the site, therefore, there is a fundamental risk that the total turbulence may exceed the design turbulence used as a basis in the load assumptions for the individual turbines.;On the other hand, a lower mean wind velocity is applied to the wind turbine locatedin the wake flow of the upwind turbine so that the mean load level is reduced. It is, therefore, not possible to decide apriori whether the overall load level will increase for the turbines in the array or not. Some manufacturers have adopted the approach  possi bly as a precaution  to prescribe a minimum spacing for erecting their turbines in an array. Other manufacturers are assuming that the load level will not increase even with narrower spacing (Fig. 18.4).
