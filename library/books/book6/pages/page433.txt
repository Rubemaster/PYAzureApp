420 CHAPTER 10 ELECTRICAL SYSTEMdesign with respect to the specific tower head mass (Vensys 2.5 MW, Siemens 3.0 MW). Therefore this is a good reason for the hope, that the manufacturing costs will be com petitive in the future as well (s. Chapt. 19). This statement would be undisputable if the prices of the raw material for the permanent magnet will not rise again. As long as China has a kind of monopoly for the material there will be a great uncertainty about the devel opment of the future prices. Some people also refer to the environmental problems at the mining of these materials in China.;Fig. 10.37. Vensys 1.5 MW with directdrive generator and permanent magnet excitation. The generator is built as outer rotor design.;Apart from the electrical characteristics, there is one further aspect to be observed inconjunction with the generator being driven directly by the rotor regardingless the kind of excitation. The bulky generator can only be integrated into the nacelle if the genera tor and the nacelle designs are completely matched spatially and statically. The genera tor mounting is at the same time also the rotor mounting. The bearing structure of the generator rotor thus becomes a part of the supporting nacelle structure which is why the generator can now only be designed mechanically in conjunction with the entire nacelle design (s. Chapt. 9). It is for this reason that the weight and the manufacturing costs of direct driven generator systems depends not only on the electrical part. The optimisation of the integrated electric and mechanical design concept is the road to success and re mains a challenge for the designer.
