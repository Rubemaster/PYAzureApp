(Deutsches Museum);Similar information also points to the province of Brabant, where a post windmill was said to have been built as early as 1119. From this northwestern corner of Europe, windmills quickly spread all over North and Eastern Europe as far as Finland and Russia 3. Numerous post windmills could be found in Germany in the 13th century (Fig. 1.3).;In addition to the post windmills, which are made entirely of wood, the socalledtower windmills make their appearance one or two centuries later. In this type of construction, the windwheel rests on a round tower made of stone. This type of mill mainly spread from the Southwest of France into the Mediterranean region, which is why it is frequently referred to as the Mediterranean type of windmill.;There is no reliable information as to whether the first post and tower windmillscould already be yawed into the wind. However, yawing soon became a commonly found property of post windmills. The post windmill in its simple and serviceable form remained in existence right into the 20th century.;In Holland, several decisive improvements were made on windmills in the 16thcentury, leading to a new type of mill, the socalled Dutch windmill. It is not known whether it was the post windmill or the tower windmill, of which some examples were also to be found in the north, which had served as the prototype. The fixed millhouse structure of the Dutch mill, where only the tower cap turned with the windwheel, permitted both the dimensions and the range of applications to be increased. Thus, the historical windmill reached its perfection towards the middle of the 19th century.
