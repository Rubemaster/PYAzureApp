Looking at such a windmill it becomes evident that this technology probably did transcend traditional windmill technology, while it managed to extract a last breath of life from some of the mills.;In the early 19th century, when windmill technology was reaching its peak in Europe, numerous windmills were also built in the New World, mainly on the East Coast where the Dutch and British had their settlements. Simultaneously, the great movement to the West started in the USA. The settlers of the great plains of the MidWest needed water, above all, when they wanted to settle down. In those places which did not have natural surface water, water had to be pumped up from wells. The large windmills were of little help for this purpose.
