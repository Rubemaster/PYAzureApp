Older wind turbines without blade pitch control have particularly high variations intheir power output (Fig. 14.23). This does not apply to more recent stallcontrolled turbines, however. With increasingly refined optimisation of the rotors aerodynamic properties, a more uniform power output is also achieved in stallcontrolled turbines.;The power variations of wind turbines with conventional blade pitch control are dependent on the turbines control characteristics, particularly the rate of pitch adjustment. Recent investigations show that favourable conditions are achieved only at certain pitch rates 8. In any case, there is a not inconsiderable fluctuation which becomes visible at a certain temporal resolution (Fig. 14.24), whereas power output becomes almost com pletely smooth with variable speed operation (Fig. 14.25).;It depends on the individual case how highly a steady power output is valued. A largefixedfrequency grid can cope with relatively great power variations. In a small isolated grid, for example where wind turbines are combined with small diesel generator power stations, high shortterm power variations cause stability and controlsystem problems. Moreover, it must again be pointed out in this context that high power variations are tantamount to high dynamic loads on the turbine. A smooth power output is, therefore, a worthwhile goal in any case.
