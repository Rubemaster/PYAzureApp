In most cases, towers of the first generation were stiff. Resonances developing duringthe startup sequence of the rotor were feared. In the course of development, however, almost all manufacturers changed to increasingly more flexible designs. For reasons of economy, the material saved in the process almost became a critical requirement (Chapt. 12.4).;Apart from the terms soft and stiff used for the tower design, the terms supercritical and subcritical design are occasionally mentioned in the literature. These terms are normally used in steam or gasturbine design where similar problems exist. The natu ral frequency of a turbine wheel with flexurally elastic characteristics on a shaft (a so called Laval rotor) has a critical value at a certain rotational speed. Turbines running at less than the critical speed are said to run subcritically. If their speed is above that, they are called supercritical runners. As these designations are much less graphic in their descriptive function and as, moreover, it is often not clear which component is su per or subcritical with respect to what, these designations are not used here 7.
