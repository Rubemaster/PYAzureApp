Both methods for controlling power have been demonstrated, for example, in 1980 by the experimental Danish Nibe wind turbines (Figs. 5.19 and 5.20). The Nibe A model had a rotor with partially adjustable rotor blades the outer sections of which could be set such that the power input was limited by the aerodynamic stall at the blades. The rotor blade pitch angle had three fixed positions which were set in depend ence on the wind speed (s. Chapt. 5.3.3). Power limiting by aerodynamic stall proved to be not very precise and, moreover, was accompanied by severe loading on the rotor and the entire turbine. Up to a certain extent, flow separation at the rotor blades was inter mittent so that, under certain operating conditions, fluttering could occur at the rotor blades (s. Chapt. 11.1).
