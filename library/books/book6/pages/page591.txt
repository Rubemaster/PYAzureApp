The IEC recommends a reference wind regime for comparing the energy output ofdifferent wind turbines. This should be based on a range of annual wind speeds from 4 to 11 ms at rotor hub height. The frequency distribution of the wind speeds should be assumed as a Weibull function with a shape parameter of k  2 (Rayleigh distribution).;14.5.2 Approximate Calculation of the Energy Yield;In the planning phase of a wind turbine project, there is the frequent problem of having to estimate the energy yield without the possibility of a precise calculation. Often, only the turbines rotor diameter and its rated power are known. Naturally, the mean annual wind speed of the site must also be known. If the wind turbine is a modern turbine with aerodynamically designed threebladed rotor, the rotor power coefficients and the
