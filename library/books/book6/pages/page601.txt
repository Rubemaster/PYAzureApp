14.7 MAJOR DESIGN FEATURES AND ENERGY YIELD 591inland sites with great surface roughness and moderate mean wind velocity. A factor of k  2.0 (Rayleigh distribution) reproduces the conditions at the coastal sites in good approximation. The kfactor generally increases with height, also because of the in creasing wind speed. The energy yield of a wind turbine various with different shape factors for a given annual wind speed (Fig. 14.33).;At the design stage and also when planning for the application of a wind turbine, ques tions continuously arise as to what extent certain technical features will affect the power curve and the energy yield. The operator should develop a feeling for the quantitative significance of these parameters even without the aid of a computer. This assessment is important to the user not only in his search for a suitable site, but also with regard to a possible adaptation of some of the turbines technical parameters. For instance, the in stalled generator power or the tower height can be varied within certain limits.;It should be recalled that with turbines with blade pitch control, the efficiency parameters affect the energy output only under partial load. Above the rated wind speed, the power is limited anyway. This means that, the greater the partial load range of the turbine, that is, the higher the installed generator power per rotorswept area, the greater the influence on the energy output by any measures effecting improvements or degrada tions. This applies only to a limited extent to turbines the power capture of which is controlled by aerodynamic stall. There is no clearcut dividing line between partial and full load in these turbines. The rotors aerodynamic properties or certain siterelated factors also have an effect on the maximum power output.
