Fig. 19.2. Evolution of the specific tower head mass referred to the rotorswept area with the rotor diameter 3 As was to be expected, the increase is greater with the heavier threeblade line of designs. However, the calculated increase was nowhere as great as had been initially as sumed after the experience gained with the first large wind turbines. With a specific tower head mass of over 60 kgm2, these turbines were simply designed wrongly! (s. Fig. 19.6). It was found that with more modern designs and with a weightoptimized construction, the increase in specific structural mass can be limited in such a way that economics are not lost with increasing size. The proof was then also furnished by a new generation of commercial turbines in this range of sizes. It was even possible to imple ment large, stallcontrolled turbines having economically justifiable structural masses.;However there is a large variation in the conceptual lines. On the example of thepresently prevailing threeblade turbines it becomes evident. The design of the rotor bearing assembly and the flexibility of the structure, in particular the bending flexibility of the rotor blades play an important role. Last but not least the selected wind turbine class, according to IEC, with different load assumptions has a certain influence on the component weight. A more conventional drive train concept combined with relatively stiff rotor blades shows a specific tower head mass in the range of 18 to 22 kgm swept rotor area (Fig. 19.3). A compact drive train and a more flexible structure with light weight rotor blades, as demonstrated by Vestas, only has a value of less than 15kgm (Fig. 19.4). Unfortunately there are not so much practical experiences with twoblade designs.
