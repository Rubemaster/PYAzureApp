How does the tower shadow affect the aerodynamics of the rotor? First of all, thereduced flow velocity to the rotor blades as they pass through the tower wake is an important factor. Reduced wind speed goes hand in hand with a change in the effective aerodynamic angle of attack. Both lead to a sudden decrease in the lift of the rotor blade. It affects both the aerodynamic loading and the torque generated.;This process is of very short duration, corresponding to the rotor speed, and represents an impulselike disturbance at the rotor blade. From the aerodynamic point of view, this means that transient aerodynamic effects can play a role which means, for example, that the temporal gradient of the change in the angle of attack can have a sig nificant influence on aerodynamic forces and moments. While the treatment of transient aerodynamic problems is difficult, it can, however, become necessary when attempting a theoretical treatment of the tower shadow problems of a downwind rotor.;On the other hand, the disturbance due to the tower wake continues for long enoughfor elastic yielding of the rotor blades to have a damping effect. Thus, the tower wake is also a problem of aeroelastics, i.e. the dynamic response of the rotor blades. Figures 6.11 and 6.12 show two examples of the effects of the tower wake on a downwind rotor.
