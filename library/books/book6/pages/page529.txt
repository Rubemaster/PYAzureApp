Knowing the mean annual wind speed is not enough to provide a precise energy calculation. It also requires information on how frequently the individual wind speeds of the spectrum can be statistically expected. The frequency distribution of the annual wind speeds can be derived from data measured at a given elevation. The mean values for ten minutes are commonly evaluated over one year and are then compiled in defined wind speed classes. To achieve a sufficiently reliable statistical basis, an evaluation period of at least several years, up to ten years according to meteorologists, is necessary to find the shape of the distribution. A reliable information about the longterm annual wind speed needs a much longer statistical basis (see Chapt. 13.3.3).;The frequency distribution is generally specified as relative frequency distribution, oras cumulative frequency (Fig. 13.12). The relative frequency distribution immediately indicates the occurrence of the most frequent wind speeds. The cumulative frequency indicates as a percentage the period within a year in which the wind speed falls below the value of a certain point on the curve. By using the cumulative frequency, the mean annual wind speed can be accurately defined and represented geometrically (Fig. 13.13). Occasionally, the socalled median wind speed is used in literature. It is defined as the wind speed with a cumulative frequency of 50  and, as a rule, it is 0.3 to 0.5 ms lower than the mean wind speed.;In practice, the problem is frequently that insufficient data about the frequency distribution of the wind speeds at a particular location are available. In such a case, there is no alternative but to use a mathematical approximation for the distribution curve. In normal wind regimes, a Weibull function will provide a good approximation (Fig. 13.14).;Fig. 13.12.
