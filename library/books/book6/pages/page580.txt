It is difficult to estimate the flow conditions in complex terrain in detail but theychange the inflow conditions for the rotor. The flow field is affected by specific topog raphic shapes such as depressions or slopes running at an angle to the direction of incident flow. Depending on the wind direction, wooded areas cause greatly variable vertical wind shear profiles of the wind velocity. Ridges or other obstacles, when over flown, lead to turbulent wake regions. These and similar effects will prevent a uniform rotor inflow as exists under test conditions in the test terrain which, as a rule, is level and free of obstacles. Experience has shown that the power curve of a wind turbine can be noticeably impaired, as a result. The lower the tower height selected in relation to the rotor diameter, the stronger these effects will be. High towers are, therefore, almost indispensible in complex terrain in the interior also from this point of view.;The density of the air varies with altitude and temperature. As the utilisation of wind energy spreads inland, wind turbines are also being erected in lower mountain regions. In Germany, the altitude of the sites in these regions rarely exceeds 600 m. In other countries, higher altitudes are encountered. In Italy, for example, wind turbines are being installed at altitudes of up to 1500 m in some areas in the Abrucci range. The power curve specified by the manufacturer, which is referred to Mean Sea Level (MSL), must be corrected by the air density prevailing at the installation site.
