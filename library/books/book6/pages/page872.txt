20.3 COMPETITION WITH CONVENTIONAL ENERGY SOURCES 865from nuclear energy (s. Chapt. 20.7). The power generation costs of different types of power plants calculated by various organisations or authors are summarised in Table 20.11 3, 4.;Table 20.11. Estimation of electricity generation costs of different types of power plants calcu lated for new power stations in the near future;It is of interest in this connection to cast a glance at the composition of the electricityprices from the producer through to the industrial or private enduser. Even if the fig ures can only be taken as a rough guide  it is a wellknown fact that the utilities never disclose their figures  their order of magnitude should be correct. In 2004, the follow ing typical picture from the point of view of a private power user was obtained in Ger many  Power generation costs 6.0 CentskWh; License fee (municipalities) 1.0 (variable up to 2.0);A mixed electricity price of payment for demand and energy consumption price of approximately 20 CentkWh is thus an enduser price which, with honest complete cost accounting, cannot be lowered, at least not under the currently prevailing condi tions. To this, profits and other costs have to be added.;Large industrial consumers often get their electricity at the 110kV level and, therefore, only have to pay for the production costs and the longdistance highvoltage distribution costs. Neither do they have to pay electricity and valueadded taxes.;Tab. 20.3, 20.5, 20.6 (Chapt. 20) USMWh   90 120  170 North Sea
