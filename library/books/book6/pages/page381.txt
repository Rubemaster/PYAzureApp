9.11 INSTALLATION OF THE ELECTRIC GENERATOR 367point of view, it would make little sense to dimension the entire drive train components for this load. The maximum transferable torque can be restricted with the help of over load couplings in the highspeed shaft. This task can be handled, for example, by a so called breaking ring coupling, dimensioned for a load three times the value of the gearbox rated torque.;Fig. 9.57.
