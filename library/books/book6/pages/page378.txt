Another solution to achieve torsional compliance in the mechanical drive train is the elastic suspension of the gearbox. In the SwedishAmerican WTS34 turbine, the gearbox was suspended in large Hframes and was held by cup spring stacks and hy draulic dampers. The maximum torsion angle under load (severe wind gusts) amounted to approximately 30. This type of gearbox suspension is technically quite complex, as is shown in Figure 9.55. Like the American MOD2, the turbine was equipped with a synchronous generator which was coupled directly to the grid, thus requiring this com plex type of gearbox suspension.
