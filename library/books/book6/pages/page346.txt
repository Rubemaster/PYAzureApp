In earlier wind turbines with partial blade pitching, the pitch mechanism had to be installed in the outer blade area (Fig. 9.25). Implementation of this involved some addi tional problems. The lack of headroom in the rotor blade crosssection in the outer third of the rotor diameter necessitates a very compact design of the pitch mechanism.;Another aspect is the pressure supply, particularly in hydraulic systems with longsupply lines through the rotor blades, and a rotary transmission leadthrough close to the rotor hub. Seen overall, shifting the central blade pitch mechanism away from the hub only causes other complications. A convincing advantage is achieved only in two bladed rotors, where partial blade pitching permits a onepiece rotor structure to be used in the area of the hub.
