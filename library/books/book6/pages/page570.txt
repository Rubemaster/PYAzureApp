About ten years ago, the maximum power coefficient of the wind turbines was stilljust over 0.40 (Fig. 14.9). In the turbines operated with constant speed, the variation of the power coefficient with wind velocity only had a narrowly limited maximum. The variablespeed mode of operation enabled a much greater range with almost maximal power coefficients to be used.;The greatest advance was achieved in recent years by means of aerodynamically optimised rotor blades. It was especially the performance of the more recent models by Enercon from about 2004 onward which revealed the dominant influence of rotor aero dynamics. The yieldoptimised, newly developed rotor blade airfoils together with the also novel rotor blade shape in the root area has resulted in the maximum power coeffi cient achieved being distinctly prominent in these turbines and reaching a level which was unknown even just a few years ago.;The electrical power output versus wind speed is referred to as the power curve. As discussed in Chapter 5.2, its calculation is based on the set of rotor power characteristics (cPcurves), the efficiency of the mechanicalelectrical energy conversion, the optimized speed of the rotor with respect to a given wind frequency distribution and, finally, the limit imposed on the absorbed rotor power by the permissible maximum power of the electrical generator. It thus summarizes all the characteristics which are essential for the energy yield of the wind turbine. The power curve is a wind turbines official certifi cate of performance, which has to be guaranteed by the manufacturer. This is why the accurate description and confirmation of the power curve is of special significance.
