More recently, socalled fourpoint contact bearings or ball bearing slewing rimsare used almost exclusively (Fig. 9.19). These bearings are less sensitive to deforma tions of the bearing body, thus avoiding the concentrated peak loads occurring with cylindrical rollers under these circumstances. Where the blades are relatively small, a single row arrangement suffices whereas large rotor blades require doublerow four point bearings (Fig. 9.20).
