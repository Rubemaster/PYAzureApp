Given the current conditions, forged rotor hubs are no longer an option for economicreasons. The ever increasing dimensions of turbines are another reason. Forged parts with the dimensions of rotor hubs of wind turbines in the megawatt category are ap proaching the limits of production engineering.;9.4.1 Cast Steel Rotor Hubs for ThreeBlade Rotors;The initial search for the optimum hub design was ended by the dominance of the three bladed rotors in wind turbines, at least temporarily. Threebladed rotors do not require hinges so that a rigid hub body is adequate. The preferred material is now cast steel.;Only decades ago, cast components for dynamically highly stressed machine componentswere eyed with great suspicion. The technology of cast materials has, however, made con siderable progress since then. Today, cast steel is used for highly stressed components such as the turbine wheels in hydroelectric power plants and this technical advance is also re flected in the construction of wind turbines (Fig. 9.12).;It goes without saying that no everyday cast steel is used for this purpose. A much moresuitable material for components having a dynamic load spectrum has been found to be spheroidal graphite castiron. The technology of casting these components is clearly more demanding than for the usual castings. Various foundries have specialised in this technology, especially in Germany, and supply highquality rotor hubs and increasingly also other com ponents for wind turbines (rotor axles, loadbearing nacelle bedplates etc.). The cast hubs
