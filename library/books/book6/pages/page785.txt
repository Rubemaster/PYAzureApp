In the assessment of these accidents, it should be taken into consideration, however, that storms of this type will cause heavy damage everywhere and often also cost human lives. It would be inappropriate and also technically not feasible to demand that wind turbines can withstand all natural catastrophes. In hurricanes, typhoons  or also heavy earthquakes  destroyed wind turbines will certainly be counted among the lesser evils.;A reliable protection against lightning is an important feature for a wind turbine (Fig. 18.49). In level terrain, high, slender structures perfectly attract lightning strikes. The lightning protection system must protect the mechanical components from damage as well as ensure that the electrical and electronic components are not destroyed or sub jected to excessive voltage.;The components primarily affected by a lightning strike are the rotor blades. If theblades or their spars are made of steel, they will form an ideal lightning conductor and do not need any further lightning protection devices. In the past, rotor blades made of glass fibre material were manufactured without providing special lightning protection components. However, with the increasing use of wind turbines the number of cases of damage due to lightning strikes rose steeply. The frequency of such cases has assumed a prominent place in insurance statistics, creating economic pressure to limit this type of damage.
