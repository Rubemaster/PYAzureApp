Lightning strikes are unavoidable on large wind turbines (s. Chapt. 18.8.2). Most of the lightning strikes on the rotor blades hit the area of the blade tip, resulting in consider able damage. Although it was initially thought that one could dispense with a lightning protection system on rotor blades of nonconductive composite fibre glass material, this was found to be not true in actual operation. For this reason, the demands for effective lightning protection have become more and more vociferous as more and more wind turbines of increasing size were installed  especially from the insurers. Today, light ning protection systems are a standard feature with all new rotor blades (Fig. 8.30).;The lighting protection system consists of a socalled receptor in the area of theblade tip. In the simplest case, this is a metal part which is screwed in and thus can be easily exchanged. In the interior of the rotor blade, a thick metallic wire runs as light ing conductor down to the blade root where the conductor is connected with flexible metallic strips to the rotor hub and thus to the earthing system of the wind turbine (s. Chapt. 18.8).
