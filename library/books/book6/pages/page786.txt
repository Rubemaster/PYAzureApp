7.8). It consists of, among other things, lightning arresters (copper brushes and flexi ble copper strips) at the critical interfaces where they discharge the lightning into the earthing system of the foundations (Chapt. 9.7).;One environmental effect which can also lead to impairment of the operational safety is ice accretion on the rotor blades under certain weather conditions. The danger of icing is greatest at temperatures around freezing and high humidity at the same time. The fre quency of such conditions depends greatly on the location of the site. Apart from the fact that, naturally, this affects only Northern countries, it can be said that such weather conditions occur more rarely at the coastal sites than those in the low mountain ranges further inland. Measures against ice accretion on wind turbines have hitherto been taken only very rarely but the problem is being taken more seriously as the turbines are spreading.;Ice can form on all parts of a wind turbine. It is a particular nuisance at ventilationinlets and other openings and at the anemometer (Fig. 18.50). In most cases, the ane mometer system on the nacelle roof is the first one to be taken out of action unless icing is prevented by heating. This type of icing can critically affect the operability of the system, especially if the system has been out of action for some time and is to be started again.;One disadvantageous consequence of the formation of ice on the rotor blades is thatthis will considerably worsen the aerodynamic airfoil characteristics. The risk of icing is much greater when the rotor is turning than when it is standing still. The typical ice accretion at the leading edge of the airfoil reduces the generation of lift and increases
