20.2.1 Basics for Calculating the Costs of Electricity;The repayment time granted for the capital invested can be considered from variousperspectives. There are many good reasons why, from a socioeconomic point of view, a wind turbine could be granted a repayment time corresponding to its life time. But from the point of view of a commercial investor, a payback period of twenty or more years for an investment of some hundreds of thousands of dollars is unrealistic. Capital recov ery periods exceeding 10 years run counter to good market practices, particularly for small turbines bought by private users. A private investor who accepts an amortisation time of ten years for a small wind turbine does so with quite a lot of idealism.;It is a different story with wind park projects including large wind turbines of themegawatt power range. The public utilities are used to having to write off large conven tional power stations over twenty or more years. Moreover, a wind turbine in the mega watt power range will certainly have a longer life expectancy than a small 50 kW turbine. For these reasons, there would be some justification in granting longer repay ment periods to larger wind turbines.;The capital raised for an investment, in particular the bank loans, will in many casesbe redeemed by regular repayments over a certain period of time, called the redemp tion or amortisation time or better, the capital repayment time. The constant re payment rate comprising constant interest rate and an increasing repayment is called annuity. It represents the capital costs to be raised annually. The annuity can be calcu lated in dependence on the period of capital repayment and the interest rate by using the familiar formula;Figure 20.1 shows the annuity with sufficient accuracy for rough estimates without using a calculator.
