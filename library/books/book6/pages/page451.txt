438 CHAPTER 11 CONTROL SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONAL SEQUENCEwill slip so that the air forces will passively yaw the leeward rotor. The control system and operational control of the yaw system briefly described on the example of the WKA60 turbine is typical for a large turbine. In smaller turbines, simpler processes are possible.;Regardless of how the sequence control system of the yaw drive is set up and thecontrol characteristics are determined, temporary deviations of the wind direction from the azimuth angle of the rotor cannot be avoided. An impression of the size of the yaw angles occurring is given by the values plotted in Figure 11.7. The average yaw angle is of the magnitude of approximately 5 degrees. This involves a certain amount of rotor power loss. As this only becomes noticeable in the partial load range, the loss remains within bearable limits at approximately 1 to 2  of the annual energy yield 4.;Apart from trying to keep the mean yaw angle as small as possible, the yawing rateof the rotor is also determined by taking into consideration the gyroscopic moments. The yawing rate is normally about 0.5 degrees per second. At higher rates, the influ ence of the gyroscopic moments becomes too great (Chapt. 5.6).;The fundamental problems of power control in a turbine become particularly apparent if the task of control is compared to that of a conventional thermal power station (Fig. 11.8). In a thermal power station, the fuel, or in more general terms the primary energy source, is fed to the steam generator in doses (action A). The steam is then fed into the turbine via an adjustable inlet valve (action B). The turbine drives the electric
