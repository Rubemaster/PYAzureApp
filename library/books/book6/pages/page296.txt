282 CHAPTER 8 ROTOR BLADESlightweight materials with high strength, which was vital for their existence regardless of costs. Today, these industries are inconceivable without these materials.;The usefulness of these new materials was also discovered in other fields of technology. It was mainly the possibility of being able to produce dimensionally stable compo nents in almost any shapes without expensive tools and devices which was considered to be a great advantage compared with traditional wood or metal designs. Maximum strength characteristics and low weight played less of a role than the low costs of manufacturing. Given these prerequisites, fibrereinforced materials became successful mainly in the construction of boats and for manufacturing all possible types of containers.;The development of rotor blades for wind turbines in fibrereinforced compositeslinked up with both paths of development. On the one hand, the requirements for strength and stiffness were as high as in aviation and, on the other hand, weight did not play such a predominant role so that the advantages of cheap materials and manufactur ing processes could also be adopted from boatbuilding.;The merit of having been one of the first to make the rotor blades of a wind turbine ofcomposites is due to U. Htter. The 17mlong rotor blades of the W34 was constructed in glass fibre composite technology as early as 1959 (Fig. 8.11). Htter solved the prob lem of load transfer from the composite material into the metal flange by means of a loop connection. The rotor blades were very successful and were used as a model for large components in highquality fibrereinforced composites generally, not only for the rotor blades of wind turbines, at least in Germany.
