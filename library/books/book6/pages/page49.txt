A decade before the beginning of the rural electrification programme, first efforts were made in the US to develop advanced electricitygenerating wind turbines. As the de clared aim was to supply power to those private consumers who were not yet connected to the public utility grid, development was concentrated on small wind turbines with rated powers of a few kilowatts. These small wind turbines, which became known as wind chargers, were used for recharging batteries and thus provided a modest power supply for rural settlements and remote weekend houses.;The brothers Marcellus and Joseph Jacobs deserve special mention here. In 1922,they started to develop a small wind turbine 14. After initial tests with twobladed aircraft propellers, they developed a threebladed rotor with a diameter of 4 m, which directly drove a lowspeed DC generator (Fig. 2.9). This Jacobs wind charger proved to be a vanguard design and a sensational sales success. From 1920 to 1960, tens of thousands of these wind turbines were produced in various versions from 1.8 to 3 kW rated power. They won wide acclaim for their reliability and low maintenance require ments. One of these wind turbines was taken along by the American Admiral Byrd in 1932 on his expedition to the Antarctic and operated without maintenance for more than 22 years until 1955.;Fig. 2.9.
