but from a greater distance, the filigree lattice structure becomes much more transparent and begins to merge with the background. Reflection of light, which is much stronger in the case of closed structures (steel tubes), also plays a role (Fig. 12.20). Proponents of lattice towers consider the visual effect from a greater distance to be less obtrusive in the landscape than the tubular towers.;Like hightension masts, lattice towers can be welded or bolted together from angledsections. Tubular steel struts are sturdier, however, at least for the larger elements sub jected to greater loads. Although this type of construction would not be the cheapest for wind turbines, it is the better alternative. It is an indubitable advantage of lattice towers that with a given height and stiffness, the expenditure of material is less than in the case of tubular towers.
