430 CHAPTER 11 CONTROL SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONAL SEQUENCElimiting and speed control are provided by the grid. But even in this simpler version, a supervisory and sequence control system is necessary for operation monitoring and controlling the operating sequence.;The following discussion of the control problems of wind turbines is conducted withthe same assumptions as that of the electric generator systems. The fundamentals of electrical machine control must be known or standard literature consulted 2.;The tasks of the control system and of the operational sequence control of a wind tur bine as outlined above require certain input signals, the acquisition of which, together with the subsequent processing of the measurement values, has a considerable influ ence on the quality of the control functions. The control system can be as good as its input signals.;However, certain provisions from the electrical grid will also interact with the opera tional sequence. Power control is based on the direct measurement of the electrical power generated and does not need the wind speed as input signal. The rotor speed in variablespeed operation and sometimes the variation of the speed on starting and stop ping the rotor are controlled by variation of the electrical torque of the generator. This requires a frequency inverter in the electrical system. The safety system will detect a whole number of state variables the thresholds of which can initiate a safety shutdown of the plant.
