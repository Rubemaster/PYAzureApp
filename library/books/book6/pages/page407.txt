Lowpower electric motors having permanent magnets are widely used in drive engi neering. When the dimensions become larger, the high costs of materials for the mag nets, socalled neodymium iron (NdFeB), and occasionally also exotic materials such as samariumcobalt alloys, become much more significant so that there is no longer any saving compared with conventional designs. On the other hand, the permanent magnet technology has also been penetrating the Megawatt power range in drive engineering, for example in compact marine propulsion units, in recent years so that it has been pos sible to lower the costs of magnetic materials with the consequence that generators for wind turbines can also be manufactured economically (Fig. 10.11).;In principle, the permanent magnet technology can be used for all types of construction of electric machines 5. The essential advantages are that there is no longer any exciter current and the efficiency is thus higher. With the great power density, the mass is reduced for a given power or, in other words, the construction becomes more com pact. On the other hand the controllability is less because the voltage can not be con trolled via the exitation frequency. The noload voltage can, therefore, be 30 to 40 below the nominal voltage. The disadvantage which is the most severe one up to the present day lies in the high costs for the material of the permanent magnets and their complicated assembly.
