414 CHAPTER 10 ELECTRICAL SYSTEMtherefore, only be operated in the oversynchronous mode. The electric torque can be influenced by changing the current in the DC link. This configuration is known as sub synchronous converter cascade in electrical drive technology and is used in controlled speed drive units. In the generator configuration, this is an oversynchronous cascade.;A considerable disadvantage of previous oversynchronous cascades was the high reactivepower requirement. The reactivepower requirement of the converter can be limited by restricting the speed range. The economic speed range is thus restricted to approximately 100 to 130  of the nominal speed. Another disadvantage of the older systems hitherto built is the relatively high proportion of unwanted harmonics passed on to the grid. Up to now, very few large wind turbines have been equipped with an over synchronous converter cascade, for example the Spanish AWEC60 experimental tur bine, which was derived from the German WKA60 15.;The doublefed induction generator (DFIG) as a variablespeed system was implemented for the first time in the large experimental Growian wind turbine (Fig. 10.30). In contrast to the oversynchronous converter cascade, the slip power of the induction generator is not only fed into the grid, but, conversely, the rotor is also supplied with power from the grid. In this way, both oversynchronous and subsynchronous operation of the generator is possible.
