As a rule the foundation of wind turbines are constructed of Category B25 concrete according to German classification. Special attention has to be paid on the quality of the construction work. Due to the heavy loading on the foundation cracks can occur, parti culary on the surface, after some time. Penetrating and freezing water causes severe damages. Many turbine suppliers include the foundation in their delivery so that the foundation is covered by their warranty they grant to the custumer. It is common prac tice, a formwork is set up in the foundation pit and the steel reinforcement is plaited before the concrete is poured into the pit (Fig. 12.35).;Integrating the foundation section, to which the bottom flange of the tower is joined,requires some experience. The flange of the foundation section must be placed in a hori zontal and level position with only a small tolerance to prevent the tower from slanting. In the foundation of a wind turbine of the 500 kW class with an foundation section flange diameter of approximately 3.6 m, the maximum allowable deviation from the horizontal is in the range of  2 mm.;It is obvious that the soil consistency or, more precisely, the clamped stiffness ofthe tower in the ground, has an influence on the natural bending frequency. This influ ence is small on solid ground and may be neglected in a first approximation. In very loose soil, however, this does not apply in every case. Using the example of a simple bed plate, Figure 12.36 shows the order of magnitude of a reduction to be expected in the first natural bending frequency of the system.
