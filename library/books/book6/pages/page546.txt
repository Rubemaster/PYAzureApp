In addition to the planning of the installation of wind turbines, their operation also requires some sort of continuous wind measurement. Although almost all large turbines have their own operational wind measuring system, additional information about the wind speed is still frequently of interest. The operator wants to compare the actual energy yield with the theoretically possible value. This already requires an additional wind measuring system, which must be sufficiently clear of the turbine to remain unaffected by the rotor (Chapt. 10.1.1). In some cases, especially in large wind farms, turbine independent wind measurement is also used for power output management and supervi sion. Thus, for example, it is desirable for various reasons to perform the shutdown and startup sequence in groups. For this purpose, the signals from a turbineindependent measuring point are used.;What instruments and measuring methods are suitable for this type of wind measurement? An instantaneous measurement of the wind speed with a conventional cup anemometer by hand may on occasion be quite illustrative, but its value for technical purposes is virtually zero. Usable data can only be obtained by means of measurements over a certain period and recording of the measured values. This requires a stationary measuring system on a mast with a logging device for the measured data. The sensors of a wind measuring system suitably consist of a combination of an anemometer and wind vane or, most recently, of an ultrasonic sensor which has no moving parts (Fig. 13.27).;Time and again, the accuracy of the sensors becomes the subject of discussions aboutthe quality of the measurement data which is why considerable importance must be ac corded to the calibration of the anemometers. The anemometers must be checked and recalibrated at regular intervals. Today, independent institutions will provide anemome ter calibrations and an operator is well advised to pay attention to these.
