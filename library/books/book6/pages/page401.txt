Instead, the rotor is turned forward or back, compared to its idling position, by the so called load angle (rotor displacement angle), when mechanical power is added or, re spectively, taken out. The size of the load angle is a measure of the level of loading. During idling it is zero, when energy is released (generator operation) it has a positive value, and when energy is consumed it has a negative value (motor operation) (Fig. 10.4). The load angle is equivalent to the time lead or lag of the grid voltage compared to the polewheel (rotor) voltage.;The torque characteristic of a synchronous machine is represented as a function ofthe load angle. A stable operating point is only possible in the range of   180 to 180. The highest torque (pullout torque) is reached at   90. According to the VDE (Association of German Electrical Engineers) standard, the nominal operating point should be at   30. Normally, the pullout torque has twice the value of the nominal torque. The torque characteristic can be influenced to a limited extent by varying the excitation voltage of the pole wheel.;The efficiency of synchronous machines is generally higher than in comparable induction machines. In practice, this difference is relatively small (1 to 2 ), at least in large machines. Efficiency increases with increased size (rated power), as is the case in other machines. The efficiency as a function of the load is of particular interest with respect to their use in wind turbines (Fig. 10.5). Smaller generators do not only have a lower nominal efficiency at full load, but also exhibit a greater drop in efficiency at partial load.
