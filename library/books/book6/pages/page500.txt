Towers with sitemixed concrete can also be constructed as prestressedconcrete towers. The prestressedconcrete type of construction originally comes from bridge building and is also used for other concrete components subjected to high dynamic loads. In this process, the steel reinforcement or the special tensioning elements (ropes or steel rods) are introduced into the concrete structure and prestressed, that is to say a compressive stress is generated in the concrete body so that tensile stresses which, for example, are caused by a bending load are largely cancelled. Because of the additional tensioning elements, prestressed concrete structures are comparatively expensive. Their load bearing capacity is greater than that of normal reinforced concrete and it is also possible to influence stiffness (natural frequency) within certain limits by varying the pre stressing.;Some large experimental turbines of the Eighties were installed on prestressed concrete towers (WTS75, AeolusI and LS1). For cost reasons, prestressed concrete tow ers of sitemixed concrete are normally not considered for commercial wind turbines.
