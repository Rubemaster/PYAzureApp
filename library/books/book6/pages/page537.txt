The diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in wind speed are of little significance for grid coupled wind turbines. The fluctuations in the longterm mean annual wind speed from year to year, on the other hand, are quite important. Wind turbines are investments which must be financed from their income over relatively long periods (up to 20 years) (Chapt. 20).;The investor, therefore, has to know the longterm mean annual wind speed as accurately as possible as a basis for his calculation of economic viability. But the fluctua tions in energy yields from year to year can also cause considerable problems in the financing if liquidity is at a premium. The problem becomes even more acute due to the fact that the delivery of energy by a wind turbine, roughly speaking, varies with the cube of the mean annual wind speed. Changes in wind speed appearing to be rela tively small, therefore, cause a drastic change in energy yield, and thus in the revenues. This problem had been completely underestimated in the initial period of commercial wind energy utilisation and entered properly into the consciousness of the investors only with the succession of years of low winds from about 2000 to 2006. Since then, wind forecasts are rightly being looked at much more critically and extend to speculations about the change in wind conditions as a consequence of the general climate change.;All wind forecasts are based on the prediction of a longterm mean value which isbased on experience or, even better, on past measurements. Meteorologists point out that the observation period should be at least 30 years in order to be able to make a reliable statement about the longterm mean value. The problem with commercial wind energy utilisation is that there are practically never any reliable wind measurements, taken over such a long period, available for the actual sites. The wind forecast, there fore, has to use wind models which are partly theoretical and partly empirical (s.a. Chapt. 13.5.2).
