404 CHAPTER 10 ELECTRICAL SYSTEMas with a synchronous generator. Although its oscillatory characteristics are less prob lematic, the dynamic loads imposed on the wind turbine are also high.;An improvement can only be achieved via a higher nominal slip value. This, however, is in conflict with efficiency, generator weight and cost. Nevertheless, the nominal slip of an induction generator can be manipulated to a certain extent. There are various methods to increase slip. The most obvious possibility is designing the rotor for a higher slip values. The example of an induction generator with a rated power of 1200 kW shows to what extent this affects efficiency (Fig. 10.19). Overall generator mass also increases with increasing nominal slip (Fig. 10.20). Up to a nominal slip of a few per cent, the increase in cost is not so serious, if it is kept in mind that the generator itself constitutes only a small part of the cost of the total electrical system.;One disadvantage of induction generators with increased slip which must not be ignored is the problem of heat dissipation. Generator cooling and with it the entire cooling air ducting system in the nacelle must be designed for a higher throughput.;Seen overall, a generator design with a nominal slip of 2 to 3  should represent afeasible compromise for providing a minimum amount of speed compliance with justi fiable additional expenditure and loss of efficiency. On the other hand the variable speed systems including a frequency converter is the more advanced concept. The costs of the inverters have been reduced in the recent years whereas the efficiency could be increased considerably. Induction generators with a larger slip only are an option for small wind turbines, where a frequency inverter is considered as to sophisticated and to expensive.
