370 CHAPTER 9 MECHANICAL DRIVE TRAIN AND NACELLEcontains filtering and an oilcooler. The other bearing points such as rotor blade bear ings, yaw bearing and the generator bearings are partially supplied via external, auto matic grease lubrication pumps. In some cases central oilsupply systems are used for the gearbox and the generator bearings. They include cooling and filtering of the oil.;The brakes always need to be supplied with hydraulic fluid since they are hydraulically actuated, as a rule. Wind turbines which also have hydraulic blade pitching are normally supplied via a central hydraulic system containing the necessary pumps, compensation valves etc in one compact unit.;If the oil temperatures for the gearbox are very low after prolonged shutdown periods, especially in the winter months, the oil must be heated before the turbine is started up. A certain amount of heating is also required for certain sensors and test instruments, for example the anemometer system on the nacelle roof.;The current distribution board for the auxiliary units is always accommodated in the nacelle. It also includes certain switching and monitoring facilities needed for mainte nance work in the nacelle. At least parts of the control systems for power control and operation are located in the nacelle. Therefore the nacelle must have space for some switching cabinets.;In most turbines, the transformer and the frequency inverter, if present, are accommo dated in the tower base. However, the trend is towards installing the frequency inverter and the transformer in the nacelle. This arrangement is preferred mainly in large tur bines which are also intended to be used in offshore applications.;The condition monitoring normally used today requires a multiplicity of sensors and data storage devices (s.a. Chapt. 18.7.3). These relatively small items must also be taken into consideration in the spatial design of the nacelle.
