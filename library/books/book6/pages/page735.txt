The decisive parameters determining the aerodynamic efficiency are the number ofturbines and the array geometry, the turbine characteristics (thrust coefficient), the tur bulence intensity on site and the frequency distribution of the wind direction. Figures 18.1 and 18.2 show the order of magnitude of array efficiencies based on theoretical model calculations. The conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that, from an aerodynamic point of view, a turbine spacing of 8 to 10 rotor diameters in the prevailing wind direction and 3 to 5 rotor diameters across the main wind direction represents a reasonable array geometry. Under such conditions, the array efficiency reaches ap proximately 90 . This result has also been confirmed by practical experience. The aerodynamic array efficiency is essentially determined by the following parameters;It is not only the energy yield of an array which differs from the sum of interference free single turbines, but also the power curve. When the wind reaches cutin speed, the wind turbines of the first row will start up first, but the turbines behind these will not run yet due to the retarded flow. Progressively, all wind turbines will start up until,
