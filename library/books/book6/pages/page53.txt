Apart from the French engineer Andreau, who implemented his ideas in England, anumber of other engineers in France worked on designing larger wind turbines 16. In 1958 Romani built a large experimental wind turbine in Nogent le Roi near Paris with the support of the public utility company lectricit de France (EdF) (Fig. 2.13). The BestRomani wind turbine had a rotor diameter of 30.1 m and operated with a synchro nous generator with 800 kW rated power. It was tested until 1963 and dismantled after some blade damage had occurred.;In parallel with this project, Louis Vadot developed two wind turbines which wereset up in SaintRemy, France, on the coast of the English Channel. Vadot started out with a smaller wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 21.1 m and a rated power of 132 kW (Fig. 2.14). A larger wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 35 m and an installed generator power of 1000 kW followed which was based on the same technical concept. Both wind turbines had induction generators. Operational experience with these two wind turbines is said to have been comparatively good 16. However, both wind tur bines were dismantled in 1964 and 1966, respectively, as the EdF was no longer inter ested in the utilisation of wind power.;Fig. 2.11.
