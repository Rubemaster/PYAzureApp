Gearboxes with one planetary stage and two additional parallelshaft stages are usedin many latemodel turbines (Fig. 9.46). With the additional parallel shaft, the primary and secondary shafts are no longer coaxial. This has the advantage that a hollow through shaft can be implemented more easily. In this way, power supply lines supply ing power to the blade pitch drive, as well as measurement and control signals for the rotor, can be routed through the gearbox.;In larger gearboxes, an auxiliary rotor drive is frequently flanged to the gearboxhousing. Using this electric motor, the rotor can be turned slowly. Such an auxiliary unit is indispensable for assembly and maintenance work in large rotors.;Gearbox lubrication is usually carried out via a central oil supply in the nacelle. As arule, it also contains an oilcooler and a filter. The purity and the temperature of the oil have turned out to be very important for the service life of the gearbox of wind turbines. Therefore monitoring of the oil quality is a must in wind turbines, as well as a careful maintenance with respect to oil exchange.
