Of all the effects on the environment caused by wind turbines, their visual impact on the landscape is the most difficult factor to assess. Accordingly, discussions of this subject are controversial and frequently verge on becoming polemic. In recent years, building application for even the smallest wind wheels were occasionally rejected by the au thorities with express reference to the unacceptable visual impact on the landscape. Nowadays it is frequently the nature conservation organizations which are raising objec tions against the visual effect of wind turbines, thus preventing not a few wind power projects (Chapt. 18.2).;The majority of unbiased visitors considers them with a mixture of inquisitiveness,admiration and incomprehension  just like with other technical novelties. Depending on how informed the visitor is, one or the other basic attitude will prevail. Only very few visitors spontaneously react negatively to the appearance of wind turbines. However, it would be difficult to consider an individual wind turbine as visual pollution of the landscape, as even the largest turbines look relatively modest as close as 10 rotor diame ters away (Fig. 15.18). The real problem is not presented by individual cases, but rather by the intention of expanding wind energy utilisation to such an extent that it will con tribute significantly to the supply of energy. In other words The visual effect on the landscape is a problem of large numbers. Large numbers of clustered wind turbines existed for the first time in the US in the form of wind farms. Pictures of the Californian wind farms  frequently photographed with exaggerated optical effects  have repeatedly been used as proof of the unacceptable visual impact. It is undoubtedly true that Ameri can wind farms, with thousands of small wind turbines crammed in seeming disorder into a very small space, are not a useful model for Europe.
