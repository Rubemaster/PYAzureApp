The concept of using the fixed shaft as rotor bearing has been tried in conventionalwind turbines with gearbox, for example in an earlier Bonus Mk V, where the torque from the rotor is transferred to the gearbox by a lightweight torsionally flexible shaft through the hollow support shaft (Fig. 9.40). In the later Bonus models, the stationary rotor shaft was abandoned again in favour of the threepoint suspension of rotor shaft and gearbox.;The examples quoted illustrate the most important ones of the existing design concepts. However, the complete range of technical solutions and their variants and interim solutions is much greater. As the size of the wind turbines increases, new concepts are required. Above a certain size, the nacelles must be assembled in parts at the installation site and erected. Using large turbines offshore with the associated special demands for maintenance and ease of repairs will also raise new requirements.;A mechanical breaking system is besides the aerodynamic breaking function of the rotor an unavoidable component of a wind turbine. It is part of the mechanical drive train. The first task is to keep the rotor of a wind turbine in position when it is at a standstill. Locking the rotor is a must for servicing and repair work and is generally common prac tice during normal down times. Moreover, most turbines have locking bolts between rotor hub and nacelle for bridging extended periods of standstill and for servicing and repair work. The rotor can thus be secured in one or more positions.;Rotor brakes are almost always disk brakes. Suitable disk brakes can frequently beadopted costeffectively from existing production runs intended for other machines or vehicles. Against this background, the design of the rotor brake itself poses few
