The previous example is a variablespeed system with synchronous generator and recti fier with DC link. Naturally, other electric and mechanical designs have different losses and the mechanicalelectrical efficiency will, therefore, be different (Fig. 14.8). At full load, the total mechanicalelectrical efficiencies are very close in the range of 92 to 94 . The very high efficiency of the todays inverters eliminate previous backlashes in the efficiencies of the variablespeed systems compared to the fixedspeed systems without inverter.;Larger differences are obvious in the partial load range. The gearless concepts showa remarkable advantage at a load range below 50  of the rated power. The practical experiences with a better performance of these concepts on sites with lower wind speed confirm this. But also concepts with highspeed permanent magnet generators and gear boxes perform better at partial load conditions (s. Chapt. 10.1.3).;Fig. 14.8. Efficiency vs. Relative power for different drive train configurations;14.1.4 Power Coefficients of Todays Turbines;Considered in greater detail, the power characteristics of presentday wind turbines show distinct differences which are definitely significant for the economic assessment. A better power curve, recognized more easily from the variation of the turbine power coefficient vs. wind velocity, means a noticeable advantage with respect to the energy yield to be expected. The existing differences are marked not only by the losses in the mechanicalelectrical drive train but even more by the aerodynamic quality of the rotor and the speed control of the rotor (Fig. 14.9).
