6.3.3 Vertical Wind Shear and Cross Winds;The wind flow produces unsteady, cyclically varying loads as soon as it strikes the rotor asymmetrically. One unavoidable asymmetry of the oncoming wind flow is caused by the increase in wind speed with height. During each revolution, the rotor blades are subjected to higher wind speeds in the upper rotational sector and are thus subjected to higher loads than in the sector nearer the ground. A similar asym metry of flow at the rotor is caused by the largely unavoidable crosswinds which occur with fast changes in wind direction.;The vertical wind shear and crosswinds on the rotor lead to a cyclically increasingand decreasing aerodynamic load distribution over the rotor blades. Compared to the basic loading with a steady, symmetrical wind, there are considerable variations in load (Fig. 6.7). The linearly asymmetrical wind stream assumed here in this example qualitatively stands for the vertical wind speed profile or also for an asymmetrical wind flow due to a change in wind direction.;The changing aerodynamic loading on the rotor blades during one rotor revolution, of course, also means varying total rotor loads and hence varying loads for the remaining parts of the turbine. The cyclically changing pitching and yawing mo ments, in particular, represent considerable fatigue loads for the mechanical com ponents of the yaw drive. This applies especially to hingeless twobladed rotors. For this reason, large wind turbines with twobladed rotors are usually built with a tee tering hub, which more or less compensates for these changing loads.
