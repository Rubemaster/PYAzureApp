The motordriven yaw system of the nacelle, the azimuth or yaw drive, has the task of automatically orienting the rotor and the nacelle into the wind. From an operational point of view, the yaw system is an independent subsystem. From the constructional point of view, it constitutes the transition from the nacelle to the tower head. Some of its components are integrated into the nacelle, some into the tower head. The entire system consists of the following components;The azimuth or yaw bearing is subject to contradictory requirements. On the one hand, it should ensure easyrunning yawing and a long service life and, on the other hand, yaw damping is desirable, even during the yawing, in order to avoid unwanted yawing oscil lations (Chapt. 11.3). These requirements can be met both by a conventional roller bear ing and by a friction bearing. The traditional design consists of a large roller bearing, whereas a fourpoint ball bearing is used as a rule in more recent designs (Fig. 9.68). In some cases, roller bearings with special yaw damping are also used (prestressed bear ings).;The alternative is a friction bearing in which the nacelle moves on sliding elementsmade of a synthetic material. This design, initially only used in smallscale turbines, is also being used successfully in large turbines, e.g. in the Vestas turbines or in the former
