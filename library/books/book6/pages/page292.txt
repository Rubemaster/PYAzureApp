Another problem with steel is posed by corrosion. It is particularly the areas of thespar or rotor blade interior which are no longer accessible which are especially problem atic in this respect. The corrosion leads to the formation of cracks which is particularly critical in steel. Continual checks are indispensable, as an undiscovered fatigue crack in the rotor blade can have devastating consequences not only for the wind turbine.
