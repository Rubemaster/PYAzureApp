When considering global wind resource maps and fundamental laws, it must not be forgotten that at any location, the prevailing wind regime will exhibit local peculiarities which can be of decisive significance to the siting of a wind turbine. The smaller the wind turbine and the more the local topography, including trees and buildings (obsta cles), differs from the ideal Hat and obstaclefree terrain, the greater the importance of the local orologic relief of the immediate surroundings. It is, therefore, useful to get an idea of whether the local terrain can be considered to be obstaclefree. According to Frost, the terrain in the surroundings of a wind turbine can be considered to be flat if (Fig. 13.24); the ratio of the maximum level difference hc to the horizontal distance betweenthese two marked points is less than 0.032 for a distance of 4 km upwind and 0.8 km downwind,;Naturally, the existence of level differences can also be utilised in a positive sense when a wind turbine is to be located in the area. Wind speeds on mountain ridges with a par ticularly advantageous shape (slopes of 13 to 14) can increase to double the value prevailing far away from the ridge 9.
