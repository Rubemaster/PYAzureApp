In order to provide a complete overview of all conceivable loads, the load assumptions require the consideration of other external conditions. In addition, the entire life cycle from the assembly of the plant through its erection at the site up to its operating and re pair conditions must be taken into account. With respect to its operation, in particular, the following external conditions must be noted;IEC 641001 mentions the most important electrical parameters such as voltage, fre quency and the shutdown characteristic of the turbine with the associated tolerances with regard to the presence of any loads from the grid. If these tolerances are exceeded, the presence of special loads having their causes in the electricity grid cannot be ruled out. At this point, reference should also be made to the grid connection regulations of the power companies (see Chapt. 10.5.2). Variablespeed installations with their soft grid coupling are largely protected against loads from the electricity grid.;The turbulence intensity is assumed to have values of 16 and 18 at rotor hub height in the IEC load assumptions. But it must be taken into consideration in this context that when wind turbines are erected in close proximity to one another, i.e. in a wind farm, the turbulence intensity is increased in the field (see Chapt. 18.3). Although the 021999 issue of IEC 641001 does not yet contain any specifications for taking these influences into account, an appropriate approach is proposed in the DIBt Guideline according to which no verification is required if the turbines are spaced apart by more than eight times the rotor diameter. If the distance is less, as it is in many wind farm installations, a method for calculating the increased turbulence intensity is specified 2. It is common practice to perform an individual turbulence study for larger wind park installations, in some countries it is required in the building permission.
