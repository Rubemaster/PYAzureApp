In the meantime, directdrive generators of this design are used in all Enercon turbines ofup to 6 MW and proved worthwhile. But only few manufacturers have adapted the concept of direct driven generators with electric excitation (Lagerwey, Torres).;The concept of a generator driven directly by the rotor has become a serious alternative to the standard design of a highspeed generator with gearbox. Nevertheless, its disadvantages must not be overlooked. As the size of the wind turbine increases, its assembly raises considerable problems. Maintaining an accurate air gap between rotor and stator becomes a problem as the largediameter stator can only be assembled from several ring segments. Moreover, it is not simple to cool the generator. Closed cooling systems as required for offshore installations are difficult to implement.;The heavy weight as well as the torque loading caused by the slowly rotating generator are of greater importance than the production and assembly problems. Both parame ters have unavoidable negative consequences for the entire wind turbine. In comparison with the standard design, it is found that the gearless drive train with an electrically excited generator still has distinct weight disadvantages, particularly in the multi megawatt models developed by Enercon (s. Fig. 19.8).;The series production of the extremely large ringtype generators with electrical excitation, i.e. wound poles, can be mechanised only with difficulty and requires much manual work (Fig. 10.36). Therefore manufacturing costs of this kind of electrical gen erators are high. Also with respect to a large amount of copper which is needed. The price for copper as well as for all kind of new materials are expected to rise in the future significantly.
