Practical experience shows, however, that rotors with very high tipspeed ratios need technologically complex and expensive rotor blades. The strength and stiffness re quirements can only be met by using very expensive materials. One example of these problems was the experimental German wind turbine WEC520 with a design tipspeed ratio of 16. Its rotor blades were made entirely of carbonfiber composite material. Nevertheless, the extremely slender rotor blades showed such difficult aeroelastic behaviour that rotor control was practically impossible (s.a. Fig. 2.27). One way out of this dilemma was expected to be the onebladed rotor. With only one blade high tipspeed ratios can be realized while keeping the aspect ratio and thickness of the single blade manageable. The experimental Monopteros wind turbine had approx imately the same design tipspeed ratio as the WEC520, but its single rotor blade had a normal aspect ratio and blade thickness (Fig. 2.28). Another question could be to what extent the design tipspeed ratio has an effect on the achievable power coefficient. Figure 5.57 provides information on this. The maxi mum power coefficient of the rotor changes only very little in the usual range for high speed rotors, from 5 to 15. It is only at tipspeed ratios below 5, i.e. for lowspeed rotors, that the cpvalue drops rapidly. The maximum is about 10 for the twobladed rotor. Thus, from the point of view of energy yield, there is no reason to strive for very high design tip speed ratios.
