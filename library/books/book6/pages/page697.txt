These handicaps notwithstanding, specific proposals for implementing floating offshore installations do appear time and again. One project named Hydrowind is being developed jointly with Siemens by a Norwegian company 8. The wind turbine floats with the aid of a monopilelike immersed floating body held on the seabed by cables (Fig. 17.11). Besides this concept other floating solutions are being discussed, for ex ample immersed flat structures or swimming platforms held by cables fixed at the sea bed. It remains to be seen whether in the distant future, wind energy will also be utilised at a great distance from the coast and thus in water depths up to several hundred meters which can only be exploited by means of floating structures.;The offshore utilisation of wind energy implies the problem of transporting the electri cal energy to land. Therefore the electric infrastructure forms a comparatively complex system, much more so than the cabling and the grid connection of wind turbines on land. Although the same electrotechnical considerations apply as on land, the special requirements demand other technical solutions and in some cases new ones.
