This is the point where the extended utility grid begins and with it the responsibility of the utility company. The point of transfer is marked by a prescribed isolating point which must be accessible to the utility at any time. In Germany, for example, all facili ties between the point of transfer (property boundary) and the connecting point become the property of the utility. As a rule, the operator must bear all costs up to the connect ing point in the form of a nonrepayable contribution to building costs. This regulation is disputed in some cases but it is common practice.;The technical implementation of the point of transfer and of the connecting point is relatively simple and does not differ from the facilities also used by other small power stations of comparable power output. The electrical industry provides socalled kiosk substations or head stations as transfer point. The switchgear and, if necessary, the (690 V20 kV) transformer are accommodated in a compact weatherproof housing which also contains the necessary monitoring instruments (Fig. 18.10).
