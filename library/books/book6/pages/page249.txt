 Exciting forces occurring with the rotors rotational frequency multiplied by thenumber of rotor blades. Among these are the aerodynamic imbalances, i.e. forces developing as a result of an asymmetrical air flow against the rotor (tower shadow effect, vertical wind shear).;The aerodynamically caused exciting forces are the critical ones, since they cannot beavoided, in contrast to mass imbalances. The position of the towers first natural bend ing frequency relative to these exciting frequencies characterises the design of the tur bine with respect to its vibrational behaviour. The situation differs depending on the number of rotor blades.;In a turbine with a twobladed rotor, the aerodynamic frequency of excitation occursat twice the rotational frequency of the rotor (2 P). According to American literature, the frequencies of excitation are called 1 P, 2 P and 3 P (per revolution). Plotted against the rotor speed, they are located along straight lines (Fig. 7.2).
