In the case of the largest turbines of the 5MW class today, it is no longer possible to transport and lift up the complete nacelle. Lifting a weight of some hundred tons to a height of more than hundred meters requires cranes in the socalled 1000 tonsclass. Those cranes are available but their transportation and assembly is very costly. The erection of the wind turbine becomes a tradeoff between costs for the crane and the additional costs for an erection of the nacelle in separated sections. Today an erection procedure with maximum weights of 60 to 70 tons seems to be the best compromise. Against this background the only remedy is to assemble the nacelle from prefabricated modules as the turbine is being installed. In the case of the Enercon E126 prototypes the nacelles were assembled on the site and hoisted up as several preassembled modules (Fig. 18.29). The large generator has to be lifted using two cranes (Fig. 18.30). The rotor blades are separated within two parts. The outer blades were joined to the steel blade root pieces during the assembly (Fig. 18.31). Until 2008, the E126, with a rated power of 6 MW, later uprated to 7.5 MW, a rotor diameter of 126 m and a tower height of 135 m, was the hitherto largest wind turbine in the world (Fig. 18.32). The situation is different for offshore installations. The assembly of the nacelle from several sections would be very difficult on site, considering the sea and the weather conditions. On the other hand seabased cranes can easily be moved from one place to another and they are available with lifting capacities large enough to lift the nacelle of a 5 MW wind turbine.
