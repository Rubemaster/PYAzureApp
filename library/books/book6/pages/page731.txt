 Static calculations for verifying the stability of the tower and its foundation.  Technical assessments of the mechanical engineering parts of the turbine (rotor andnacelle) or official type approval certification.;Wind parks are recognised to have a significant impact on the environment. The inves tigations and assessments of the various environmental issues therefore are a major part of the application for a building permission. Assessment studies of environmental im pact, safety aspects and economic effects typically include; noise emission,  shadow flicker,  interference with telecommunication systems,  aircraft safety,  hydrological assessment,  archaeological and historical assessment,  impact on local flora and fauna, in particular bird life,  visual impact on the landscape,  economic effects on the local economy (required in some countries). To what extend the mentioned points have to be investigated depends of the size of the project but more on the local regulations. In many countries, for example in Germany, an ecological compensation plan has to be worked out and has to be submitted with the building application. It describes all measures which are foreseen to compensate negative influences on the environment as much as possible. For example the preparation of spe cial breading areas or planting of feederplants for birds or other animals. In Germany ecological compensating measures up to an investment of 23 of the total investment of the project are required by the authorities.
