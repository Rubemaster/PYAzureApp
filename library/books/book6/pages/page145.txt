130 CHAPTER 5 ROTOR AERODYNAMICSflow, is normally given only up to the largest body crosssection. When the pressure increases, i.e. the flow velocity is retarded, separation is almost inevitable. This charac teristic of the boundary layer is also utilized in the development of airfoils. Positioning the maximum airfoil thickness further back creates a longer area of accelerated passing flow, with the consequence that with a smooth airfoil surface, the laminar boundary layer is retained to a flow length of up to 60 of the airfoil depth (laminar mainte nance by shaping). Under these conditions, the minimum drag drops to about half the value of normal airfoils, the rearward position of the thickness of which and thus the area of a laminar boundary layer of which is only at 25 to 30 of the airfoil depth. As has already been mentioned several times, this laminar effect is only achieved if the airfoil geometry is maintained most precisely and the airfoil surface is extremely smooth. In addition, the area of minimum drag only exists within a limited range of angles of attack, the socalled laminar dip (Fig. 5.40). In this area, the drag coefficient is extremely low and independent of the angle of attack within a wide range. Once the area of the laminar dip is left, the increase in drag with the angle of attack is sharper than in the case of normal airfoils.;All laminar airfoils respond to an increase in surface roughness with a drastic deterio ration in airfoil performance, although to a different degree, especially the older NACA airfoils of Series 44 and 230. The more modern LS1 airfoil exhibits a much lower drop in performance with increasing roughness (Fig. 5.41). For reasons of costs, the rotor blades of wind turbines cannot be manufactured with an arbitrarily fine finish. A suitable airfoil must thus be selected taking into consideration the finish which can be achieved from a manufacturing point of view. In airfoil theory, a
