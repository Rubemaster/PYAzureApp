The effective flow at the rotor blades is composed of the rotational rotor speed and the wind speed. Due to the increase of the peripherical speed with the rotor radius the angle of attack also varies with the rotor radius. To maintain the angle of attack and hence the lift coefficient with respect to the optimal reduction in flow velocity by the rotor the rotor blade lies to be geometrically twisted from the root to the tip (Fig. 5.53). The twist angle is here defined as the angle between the local airfoil chord and that at 70  rotor radius or that at the blade tip. Naturally, determining the optimum blade twist can only be done for a certain ratio of peripheral speed to wind velocity, i.e. for a certain tipspeed ratio. In the case of turbines operating at constant rotational speed, i.e. stallcontrolled rotors, the rotor blade twist curve can only be optimized for one wind speed. For all other operating condi tions, the twist is nonoptimal, making power losses unavoidable. Designing the blade twist for one point of operation unavoidably leads to locally limited areas of stall as the wind speed increases, mainly in the blade section near the hub. Pitchcontrolled rotors operating with variable rotor speed can maintain the optimal tipspeed ratio at least over a certain range of wind speeds. Under these conditions the optimization of the rotor blade twist, including the blade pitch angle, can be better adapted to the full operational range. In an actual design case, the choice of twist characteristic is not only determined by the variation of the effective flow velocity over the length of the blade. For manufacturing
