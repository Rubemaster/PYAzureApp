Table 19.18. Costs of grid connection for a single small wind turbine connected to the medium voltage grid  Costs US;Electrical Equipment  Transformer housing incl. transportation  Lowvoltage switchboard with safety isolators, transducer and  meters  0.420 kV transformer 500 kVA  20 kV mediumvoltage switchgear in SF6design with two  sections, safety circuit breaker for transformer, circuit breaker  with grounding for cable outlet  Cable connections, electricl material and assembly              Total;For larger wind parks, the voltage must be transformed to the high voltage of thegrid, requiring a transformer substation. Up to a size of about 40 to 50 MW the specific costs for a new transformer substation costs about 30,000 to 50,000 US per megawatt. Concerning the costs for the transformer substation, it must be taken into consideration that these are being offered today in certain standard modular sizes. They will, there fore, not fit the power of the wind park in every case and are often overdimensioned. Naturally, the specific costs referred to the wind park power will be higher than the costs referred to the transformer capacity in such cases.;Very large systems with capacities of hundred or more megawatts are single designed and manufactured units. Very often the time from ordering to delivery and com missioning is relatively long, up to one year or sometimes even longer.
