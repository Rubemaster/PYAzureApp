18.4.4 Large Experimental Turbines with TwoBladed Rotor;The development and trial of assembly methods for wind turbines having tower heights of up to 100 m and tower head weights of up to 400 t (Growian) was an important con cern in the construction of the first generation of largesized experimental turbines in the nineteeneighties. However, the erection of these turbines was facilitated by the fact that these turbines, without exception, only had twobladed rotors. Glancing back at the methods used then is of significance because those concepts of assembly could become actively considered again for the next generation of commercial turbines having rotor diameters and tower heights of more than 120 m and nacelle weights of up to 500 t.;In the case of the American experimental MOD2 units, it was still possible to employ a comparatively conventional concept. The relatively low tower height of 61 m allowed the 95tonsnacelle to be mounted using a normal building crane. The large twobladed rotor of 91 m diameter was hoisted up in one piece and joined to the rotor shaft (Fig. 18.33).
