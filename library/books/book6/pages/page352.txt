In the case of electrical pitch control systems, electrical batteries in the rotor hubmust provide the energy for emergency pitching, instead of the hydraulic pressure ac cumulators. This requires a relatively complex system with rectifiers and battery charger since the current is obtained from the grid (Fig. 9.31).;The emergency stop is triggered by a failsafe circuit, either on the basis of a fault indication from the electronic monitoring system, or from an additional monitoring system which registers an excessive rotor speed by means of a centrifugally actuated switch. This doubly redundant release system is arranged for different overspeed values. The electrical trip is activated at an excess speed of 115 to 118 . If this fails, the trip signal of the cen trifugal switch is activated at 120  excess speed.;The design of the rotor shaft assembly with the bearing system and its integration into the drive train and the nacelle has a decisive influence on the construction of the nacelle. It virtually decides the structural design of the drive train and the static concept of the nacelle, the immediate consequence being that it also has a considerable influence on the towerhead mass of the wind turbine.;What are the shortest paths for transferring forces from the rotor to the tower, thus mak ing the design as compact as possible. And the other question concerns the extent to which the integration of the components is still justifiable with regard to accessibility in terms of maintenance and repair. In other words the trend towards extensive integration of the components and the most compact design possible must be contrasted with the alternative of a more dispersed type of construction with good accessibility and ease of maintenance.
