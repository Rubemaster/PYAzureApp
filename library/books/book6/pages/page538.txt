There are only few reliable data about the mean wind speeds of a site or of a region overperiods of decades available. In Figure 13.19, the relative energy content of the mean wind speed is plotted over one hundred years for Denmark. The curve is based partly on meas ured data for the last few decades, but partly also on an estimate of the wind speed from other climatic data. Independently of the lacking longtime annual means of the wind speed, the derivation of which was obviously considered to be too unreliable, the curve shows the range of fluctuation of the energy content. This is  2025  around the 100  value of the period shown.;In recent years, the problem of annual and regional fluctuations in Germany has beendescribed by the Wind Index. Various organisations and private companies keep statis tics about the energy delivered by the existing wind turbines and publish the fluctua tions around the 100  value of the observation period on this basis. The wind index is a production index and not a wind index in the strictest sense. The most well known one is the IWET Wind Index 8. This is based on the monthly averages of the wind turbines evaluated in 25 regions in Germany (Fig. 13.20). The Index is published for these regions and shows the deviation from the 100  value. The statistics have been kept systematically since about 1989 and thus cover a period of about 20 years. In the
