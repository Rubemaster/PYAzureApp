Although the rated power of the installed generator is not the decisive parameter of the output capacity of a wind turbine, it is, nevertheless, not without significance for the energy output. The installed generator power per rotorswept area is, therefore, fre quently the subject of controversial discussions. As no theoretical optimum can be cal culated, opinions differ widely (Fig. 14.40).;There are several explanations for the highly differing values obtained for installedgenerator power per rotorswept area One essential reason is to be found in the wind regime on which the wind turbines design is based. Higher mean wind speeds justify a higher specific power output density if the theoretical optimum is to be exploited as much as possible. This is also the reason why larger turbines normally have a higher ratio. The usable mean annual wind speed increases with increasing hub height in ac cordance with the vertical wind shear. Furthermore, the type of rotor power control also plays a role.;Stallcontrolled turbines must be installed with a relatively high value of installedpower to rotor area so that the electrical generator torque is high enough to hold the turbine in grid operation even during strong wind gusts (Chapt. 5.3.2).
