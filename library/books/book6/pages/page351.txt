9.5 BLADE PITCH MECHANISM 337therefore be required for all wind turbines. In order to assess the redundancy of the blade pitch adjustment mechanism in case of an emergency, three different functional areas must be considered   Sensor and release mechanism,  Actuating elements,  Powerpressure supplies.  Multiple redundancy type triggering via electrical circuits and mechanical switches, for example centrifugal switches and vibration sensors, can be implemented without a great deal of engineering effort. Redundancy of the powerpressure supply is more difficult to resolve. In hydraulic systems, it can still be achieved relatively easily by providing additional hydraulic pressure accumulators. Electric power supply systems require bat teries as backup.;The actuating elements of the pitch drive require the greatest engineering effort inorder to achieve the desired redundancy. Although a second set of pitch motors or ac tuators is conceivable, it would still not be a complete solution. In the case of a seized rotor blade bearing, for example, it would not present additional reliability. In practice, redundancy in this respect is only possible because the pitching of one or two rotor blades is sufficient for preventing the rotor from running away. Consequently, it must be ensured that in cases of emergency, the rotor blades can be pitched independently of one another.;The safety philosophy of the hydraulic blade pitch system is illustrated by the diagrammatic representation in Figure 9.30. Each rotor blade has an independent actuator with an emergency accumulator. It is enough to turn one rotor blade into the feathered position in;Fig. 9.30. Emergency blade pitching by means of a hydraulic pressure accumulator in the rotor hub 8  order to prevent a rotor runaway. In case of a failure of the hydraulic pump in the nacelle or if supply lines are fractured, sufficient pitching power for a rotor stop remains due to the pressure accumulators in the rotor hub.
