The thrust coefficient of the rotor has a significant influence on the loss of impulse behind the rotor and thus on the extent of the wake. The rotor wake changes with the operating state of the turbine (tip speed ratio, blade pitch angle etc.). Rotors with fixed blades generate a further, thrust shearing force in the fullload range (s. Fig. 5.27) and the rotor wake is correspondingly prominent. These mathematical models were confirmed and improved upon with numerous measurements made on wind turbines. The measurements which were taken of the rotor wake of a small wind turbine and compared with the results of Ainslies model are used as an example 12 (Fig. 5.12). The theoretical treatment of the rotor wake allows some important insights to be gained. The wake area far from the rotor, from about five rotor diameters, is mainly shaped by the surrounding turbulence. The greater the intensity of the turbulence in the sur rounding air, the faster the lack of speed in the wake is equalized. A great portion of the
