1.5 THE AMERICAN WIND TURBINE 19the windwheel turned slowly, with the flyweight governor keeping the blade pitch at a shallow angle. With increasing wind speed and higher revolutions, the bladepitch angle became continuously steeper, until ultimately the six wheel sections swung completely out of the plane of the wheel (Fig. 1.18). Initially, Halladay used only a few thin wooden blades, but he increased their number until the entire wheel surface was covered with blades, like a turbine. A wind vane took care of yawing. The aerodynamic characteristics of such a wind turbine thus differed greatly from the previously known windmill sails. His wind turbine already started turning at low wind speeds, it turned comparatively slowly and developed a high torque at low speeds, exactly the right preconditions for driving a reciprocating water pump. The water pump was driven via a crank mechanism with a long vertical shaft which reached to the foot of the lattice mast. Despite his scepticism, Halladay started manufacturing wind turbines and soon sold large units to the American railroad companies. These had an increasing need for water pumps for refilling their water tanks en route (Fig. 1.19).
