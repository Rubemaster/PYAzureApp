13.2 GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF WIND RESOURCES 509law and the logarithmic height formula in various modifications and refinements, a worldwide overview of the average wind velocities at a height of 80 m was created (Fig. 13.3). The evaluation period extends over the years from 1998 to 2002. The data essentially represent the year 2000 which was estimated as the average wind year worldwide.;The wind velocities were arranged in accordance with the wind power density classesnormally used in the US (Table 13.2). The technical wind energy utilisation is consid ered to be economically viable up to class 3. In class 2 only some hot spots are suitable and class1 areas are generally unsuitable.;Table 13.2. Wind Classification based on average wind power density according to 1;The worldwide distribution of average wind speeds can only be given in a rough way. The Figures 13.4 to 13.9 present an overview over the continents respecting the important regions of the world. The data are based on data from sounding stations and tower measurements from different sources 2.;The study quoted reaches the conclusion that the global average of the wind velocities is about 4.6 ms at 80 m altitude. The authors of the study link the global averages with a deliberation on the usable wind energy potential. Accordingly, all regions which are above wind velocities of class 3 and higher are combined and from this a wind energy potential of 72 TW is calculated. If only 20  of this were used, it would be sufficient for covering the entire energy demand of the world. With reference to power generation this would even be seven times as much (s.a. Chapt. 12.1).
