Hence, wind turbines with twobladed rotors are subjected to particularly high dynamic loads if the rotor blades are joined rigidly to the rotor shaft. In order to reduce the negative consequences for the total system, either the strength and stiffness of the tur bine components must be dimensioned to accommodate this increased load, or the de sign concept of the twobladed rotor must be selected such that it can largely reduce these dynamic loads itself by means of an appropriate controlled compliance.;6.8.2 Rotor Hub Hinges in TwoBlade Rotors;In order to reduce the poor dynamic response of the twobladed rotor to asymmetrical flow conditions, a series of design ideas have been proposed and to a large part also been realised, at least in experimental wind turbines. The preferred solution is the intro duction of hinges, providing the rotor blades with additional degrees of freedom of movement, so that the dynamic alternating loads can be reduced in the rotor itself by limited yielding due to the acceleration of its own masses. The simplest way of achieving this compliance is by installing hinges between the rotor blades and the rotor shaft, i.e. in the rotor hub. Figure 6.29 shows the basic possibilities in the design of two bladed rotors.;The hingeless rotor, i.e. with the rotor blades joined rigidly to the rotor shaft, represents the traditional design. The oldfashioned windmill rotor has always been a hingeless rotor. This simple type is completely adequate for rotors with three or more rotor blades, even today. Twobladed rotors, too, were built with rigid hubs for reasons of simplicity (WTS75, AEOLUS II). The advantage is the simple construction of the rotor hub and the disadvantage is the fact that wind turbulence, in combination with the dynamic re sponse of the twobladed rotor which tends to amplify the asymmetrical and cyclic
