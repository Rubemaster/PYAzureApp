528 CHAPTER 13 THE WIND RESOURCEinterpretation of the results, two factors are of importance. The recorded energy yield of the existing wind turbines depends not only on the wind conditions. The result is also influenced by the efficiency and availability of the turbines. The persons processing the database point out that they introduced numerous corrections for purging the data of such influences. The second, grave objection is that the period covered by the statistics is not long enough in the meteorological sense. The reference level (100  value) had to be corrected several times, therefore, as the wind index progressed step by step. As long as the observation period does not approach the meteorological demand of at least 30 years, the reference value cannot be interpreted as a longterm, meteorologically sub stantiated mean value. In other words A deviation of the reference value for a period of 15 years from the assumed longtime annual mean, for example from a wind forecast, is no proof for the incorrectness of the meteorologically substantiated longterm value. Nonetheless, the wind index is a valuable aid for planning tasks and for the assessment of economic viability  provided one knows its shortcomings (Fig. 13.21).;When considering the IWET statistics from 1989 to 2009, it is noticeable that thereare fluctuations of  2024  around the reference value even for this relatively small period. Naturally, this small basis does not provide proof for the range of fluctuations also derived from Figure 13.18, but it is at least an indication. It is also noticeable here that there appears to be a cycle of succession of aboveaverage and belowaverage wind years. The lowwind years after 1996 are contrasted by the aboveaverage years from 1987 till 1995. Statistically, periods of five to seven years with a sequence of above or belowaverage wind years can apparently be expected. Wind energy utilisation must be
