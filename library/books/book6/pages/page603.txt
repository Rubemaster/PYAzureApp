14.7 MAJOR DESIGN FEATURES AND ENERGY YIELD 593yield. The aerodynamic quality of the rotor has a decisive influence especially in condi tions of low wind speeds. Figure 14.34 shows the influence of the maximum rotor power coefficient on the energy yield.;When discussing the relationship between rotor diameter, power curve and energy out put, it should not be mistakenly assumed that the rotor diameter is a variable parameter of a wind turbine. The rotor size is tantamount to the size of the wind turbine, with all what that means with regard to loads and manufacturing costs (Chapt. 19.4). The conclu sion Well just give the rotor diameter another few meters, when attempts are made to compensate for the poor performance of a certain configuration, is wrong. The real task is to achieve a technical and economic optimum performance for a given wind turbine size. The trend to increase the rotor diameter of existing turbines, which can frequently be observed in practice, is also not proof of the contrary. At best, the rest of the wind turbine with the smaller rotor had not been exploited to its full economic potential, at worst the turbine with the larger rotor will be overloaded, at the cost of reliability and operating life.;Regardless of these fundamental considerations, some manufacturers offer their windturbines with rotors of varying diameters. In nearly all cases the variants having a larger rotor diameter are only suitable for a lower level of loading, i.e. they are licensed only for a lower wind turbine (Chapt. 6.8).
