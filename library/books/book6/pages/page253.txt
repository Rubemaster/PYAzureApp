7.2 AEROELASTIC STABILITY OF ROTOR BLADES 239but also to the torsional moments about the axis of blade rotation. The position of the rotational axis, which is established in most cases for constructional design reasons, must, therefore, be included in these considerations. The pitch mechanism, too, acting in conjunction with the control system, has its own dynamic characteristic. Interacting with the structurally elastic torsional characteristic of the rotor blades, it can lead to instabili ties and states of vibration. Hydraulic actuators, in particular, can form an elastic and thus vibrating element. In contrast, the electricmotor drives normally used today exhibit very stiff characteristics so that the model concept of a tightly clamped rotor blade is justified in this case.;When the natural frequencies are correctly placed, i.e. with the correct stiffness design, unwanted vibrations of the rotor blades can be largely avoided. Nevertheless, there are some specific vibrations which do not so much have their cause in the overall vibra tional behaviour of the unit but are rather a consequence of the stiffness of the rotor blades and of the aerodynamic design of the rotor. These vibrational phenomena can occur especially in the case of large stallcontrolled rotors.;A certain type of aeroelastic instability of a wing or a rotor blade is called flutter. If, for whatever reason, the airfoil is excited into an oscillating motion, a mutual excitation of aerodynamic forces, elastic forces and mass forces can occur. In particular, it is the
