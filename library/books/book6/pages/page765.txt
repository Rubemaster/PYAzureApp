A considerably more complex crane setup was used for erecting the Swedish WTS3turbine. Using a portal crane, it was possible to lift the nacelle plus rotor and the prefabri cated tower in one single lifting operation (Fig. 18.34). Its American sister turbine WTS4 was erected in Medicine Bow, Wyoming, using a different method (Fig. 18.35). Instead of a portal crane, a tiltable swinging crane was used.
