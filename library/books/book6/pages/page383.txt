In large turbines, the cooling system for the electrical generator requires considerable space, the exception being relatively small units of up to about 1000 kW which frequently still manage with simple surface cooling of the generator. Higher powers require more elaborate cooling systems which are not infrequently larger than the gen erator itself. The majority of wind turbines have closed cooling circuits with the appro priate airair heat exchangers, and in some cases also a closed water cooling circuit. A closed cooling system has a special significance for offshore use. In more recent tur bines passive heat exchanges without active ventilation are being used. They are more simple and avoid noise emission, but they need large air intakes for capturing enough of the natural wind (Fig. 9.60). Against this background, the system of protection used for the electric generator must be considered carefully, and the cooling system must be designed accordingly. The class of protection common today for electric generators is IP 54, according to the German VDE standard.;In some cases, a complete air conditioning system with the segregation of solid waterand salt particles is provided. The conditioned air is conducted into the nacelle and possibly also into parts of the tower. A slight overpressure in the airconditioned spaces ensures that no other air can enter from the outside. Apart from generator cooling, larger installations require an oil cooler for the gearbox which is integrated into the oil circuit.
