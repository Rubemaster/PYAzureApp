In the following years, glass fibre reinforced composite material became the preferred material for wind turbine rotor blades. In the beginning, blades with wound spars and laminated outer shells were produced for the smaller Danish turbines (Figs. 8.12 and 8.13), using the cheaper polyester as resin material. The rotor blades were mainly produced by small boatbuilders who had experience in the manufacturing of boats from FRP. Wound spars made of glass fibre material with bonded outer shells were typical of the Danish wind turbines for a long time. Rotor blades of this design were also used in the large experimental turbines Tjaereborg 2 MW and WKA60.
