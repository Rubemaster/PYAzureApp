This process of rotational sampling is of considerable significance with respect to the effect of wind turbulence on the rotor blades, especially with large rotors. The fatiguing effect on the structure can increase by up to 50  compared to a merely timedependent approach to turbulences in a nonrotating, stationary reference system. The stochastic changing loads, i.e. the turbulence of the wind, can be represented on two different ways. According to this also the methods of calculation and the presentation of the results are different. The most important models are statistically based and known as time history or time domain method and spectral method (Fig. 6.26).
