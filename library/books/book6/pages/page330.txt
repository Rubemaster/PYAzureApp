One disadvantage is the availability and the costs of the very rare material for thepermanent magnets (s. Chapt. 10.5 and 19.1). Up to now China has a kind of monopole for the delivery of the commonly used neodymium iron.;The argument of the greater weight of the gearless drive train has been nearly eliminated by the very recent designs. Siemens and Vensys have developed turbines with direct driven permanent magnet generators which can beat the conventional gearbox turbines with respect to their specific towerhead weight (Fig. 9.8).;Fig. 9.8. Vensys 2.5 MW wind turbine with permanent magnet generator and rotor support by a single bearing;Problems with the durability of the gearboxes, at least in the last years, on the one hand and the heavy and costly direct driven generators on the other hand are the reasons to find a compromise between the two alternatives. The compromise is a simplified gearbox with only one or two stages in combination with a mediumspeed electric gen erator. In most cases a permanent magnet generator is used. This means for the gearbox a gear ratio of not more than 15 with one stage and about 25 in the case of two stages, but in any case the elimination of the high speed part of the gearbox. This part of the gearbox is considered as a source of wear and failures. Obviously the overall weight of the mechanicalelectrical transmission system compares favourably with the alternative concepts.
