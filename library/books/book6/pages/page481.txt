The most common tower type currently in use is the freestanding steel tube tower (Figs. 12.3 and 12.5). Mastery of the vibrational behaviour has made it easier to use this type so that tubularsteel towers with very low design stiffness can be implemented. It has thus become possible to lower the structural mass, and thus the costs of the towers, considerably by using soft designs (Chapt. 12.5).;Downwind rotors made it necessary to use slender tubularsteel towers in order to keep the tower shadow effect as small as possible. These were anchored with steel cables or in some cases with stiff trusses to ensure the required bending stiffness (Fig. 12.4). Despite their comparatively low overall mass, guyed towers are not very costefficient. The guys and the additional anchoring foundations required inflate the total cost. Moreover, the guys are considered a hindrance in agricultural areas.;It seems obvious to combine the concrete and tubular steel types of construction. Some earlier experimental turbines, for example, had a solid base with a steel tube placed on the top (Fig. 12.6). The hybrid construction of towers has become very important, since the height of the towers exceed the 100 m level (s. Chapt. 12.7).
