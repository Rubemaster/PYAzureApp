Replacing components in wind turbines is relatively expensive if these are the large and heavy parts. On the one hand, the access routes to the sites are long and require costly logistical measures for the transportation of, e.g. rotor blades, every time. In addition, disassembly and assembly are no less costly since large cranes have to be procured. Not least, accessibility is frequently delayed for days because of poor weather conditions, e.g. too much wind. The urgent wish of operators to be able to plan for repair and replacement work in advance must be seen in this light. However, this is possible only if the defects at the components can be foreseeably recognized a relatively long time before they actually occur. Defects and fractures at the mechanical components do not generally occur out of the blue but occur in most cases as a consequence of relatively long faulty operating states. If these are detected in time, greater damage can be avoided in many cases. At the least, the required repair measures or replacement operations can be carried out under planned conditions. This advantage alone saves expenses. With this aim in mind, a special type of technical condition monitoring for wind tur bines has been developed in recent years which is increasingly being used. Using strain gauges, these data acquisition and evaluating systems measure critical parameters such as tension or torque variations, but mainly vibrations and frequency spectra, using acceler ometers, and transmit these data to the service organisation via the Internet. Vibration and frequency analyses, in particular, have been found to be an effective measure
