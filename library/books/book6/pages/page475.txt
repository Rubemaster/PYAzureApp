The basic idea for control systems and sequence control in parallelgrid operation con sists in that the grid represents an invariable or rather unlimited situation from the point of view of the wind turbine, both with respect to the electrical parameters, particularly frequency and voltage, and with respect to its capability for absorbing the power fed in. This holds true as long as the wind power fed in is low in comparison with the load carrying capability of the grid. In the meantime, however, conditions are beginning to change also in the strong interconnected European power system. The wind powers fed in are becoming greater and greater whilst the injection points are located in areas hav ing weak feeders.;As wind energy becomes used more and more widely, the capability of wind turbines to respond to certain restrictions in the interconnected power system is gaining in importance. Some wind turbine manufacturers are already equipping the control system and sequence controller of their turbines in such a way that certain electrical grid pa rameters or their changes, respectively, are registered and the control and management system of the turbine responds in such a way that not only no unwanted loads on the grid are created but support is also provided for a weak grid. The prerequisite is an electrical and controlrelated design of the wind turbine which can do this. The best
