7.3 TORSIONAL VIBRATION OF THE DRIVE TRAIN 251meshing frequency of the second gear stage excites the fourth natural harmonic of the drive train. In this real example, this fourth natural harmonic is the result of the vibra tion of the relatively large mechanical centrifugal switch mounted on the highspeed shaft. Strong resonances occurred here during a test operation.;In large wind turbines, the first natural frequencies of the drive train are lower by almost one order of magnitude and range around a few Hertz. This is the range where the cyclically alternating aerodynamic forces from the rotor, for example the tower shadow interferences or the influence of the vertical wind shear, are located. Hence, there is a greater risk that the excitation frequencies emanating from the rotor will resonate with the drive train torsion, as is clearly shown by Figure 7.16.;Fig. 7.16. Resonance diagram for the Growian drive train. Resonance of the first natural drive train frequency with tower shadow interference (2 P) at a rotor overspeed of 115
