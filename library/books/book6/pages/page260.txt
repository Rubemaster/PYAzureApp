7.3.2 Equivalent Mechanical Models for the Electrical Grid Coupling;Apart from elastomechanical properties, the dynamics of the drive train are also deter mined by the electrical aspects. In the discussion of the generator characteristics it was pointed out that the various types of generator behave very differently as far as their dynamic coupling to the grid or the load are concerned. The electrical characteristics can be represented by analogous, equivalent mechanical models (Fig. 7.11). These equivalent models are only valid as far as the vibrational behaviour is concerned, namely for very small deviations around a steadystate point of operation. Any speed variability which may exist is of no consequence.;The synchronous generator is characterised by the dominant torsionallyelastic behaviour. The magnetic coupling between rotor and stator (grid) can be described by a mechanical torsion spring. The damping is so slight that it can be virtually neglected. If the generator operates on a fixedfrequency grid, the torsion spring is clamped to a solid wall, as it were. In isolated operation the frequency is determined by the instan taneous generator speed. The generator only loads the drive train with the moment of resistance corresponding to the power delivered. In contrast to the induction generator, the magnetic coupling of the synchronous generator is weak when idling, due to the gridindependent excitation of its rotor.;In the induction generator, the slip existing between rotor and stator under load acts astorsional damping, whereas the elasticity is virtually zero. During idling or after a load shedding, the coupling between rotor and stator disappears completely.
