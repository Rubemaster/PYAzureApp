17.3 OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY IN THE NORTH SEA AND IN THE BALTIC SEA 703range from 0.11 to 0.12. The gain in energy yield with increasing height is thus less than on land, with the consequence that the economic tower heights of the wind turbines are lower (Fig. 17.26) (s. Chapt. 14.4.8).;Turbulence intensity is another important characteristic parameter. Whereas the turbulence intensity over land is within a range of between 10 and 20 , a turbulence in tensity of less than 10  is measured above the open sea. Typical values are about 8  at a height of 60 to 70 m 5. As a result of this lesser turbulence intensity, the fatigue loads on the wind turbines, resulting from the wind turbulence, are less, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, the wake behind the rotor fills up less rapidly. For this reason, the distances between the turbines must be greater than with siting on land in order to achieve the same aerodynamic array efficiency (Chapt. 5.4 and 16.4.1).
