Control of the yaw motion is characterised by conflicting aims. On the one hand, the deviation of the rotor from the wind direction, the yaw angle, is supposed to be as small as possible to avoid power loss. On the other hand, the yaw control system must not respond too sensitively, to avoid continuous small yaw movements which would reduce the life of the mechanical components. The problem is to find a practicable compromise as it is not possible to set up a general rule. The solution is determined by turbine specific properties as well as by the local wind conditions.;The situation relating to the earlier WKA60 turbine will be given as an example, although it is not necessarily a generally valid model. The wind measuring system of the turbine provides a mean value of the wind direction over a period of ten seconds. This value is compared with the instantaneous azimuth position of the nacelle every two seconds. If the deviation remains below 3 degrees, the yaw control system will not be activated. If the yaw angle determined is above this value, the time until correction is determined in accordance with a preprogrammed function. If the yaw angle is small, for example 10 degrees, yawing is carried out within 60 seconds, if it is greater, e.g. 20 degrees, the yaw is accomplished within the subsequent 20 seconds. If the yaw angle determined exceeds a value of 50 degrees, the rotor is yawed immediately. The operat ing diagram shows the ranges within which the yaw system works (Fig. 11.6).;Yawing starts at rotor standstill at a wind speed of about 4 ms, i.e. 1 ms below cutin;Yawing starts at rotor standstill at a wind speed of about 4 ms, i.e. 1 ms below cutinspeed. If the wind speed exceeds 36 ms, the rotor will not be yawed. If extreme yaw angles occur at the nonrotating turbine with such extreme wind speeds, the yaw brakes
