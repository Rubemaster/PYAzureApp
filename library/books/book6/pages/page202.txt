If the reasons for loads are known, the task is to recognise the conditions during which the wind turbine is subjected to the essential loads. These conditions and the loads oc curring in them are recorded in the form of socalled load assumptions in which both the external conditions for the causes of the loading, for example the wind speeds and the turbulence, and the corresponding parameters of the state of the turbine such as rotor speed or rotor blade pitch angle are established.;It is not apparent from the outset in which load case the dimensioning loading ofdifferent types such as fracture, fatigue or failure of stability will occur. The definition and systematic arrangement of the load cases must, therefore, be comprehensive enough to include all operating conditions and additionally also other critical states in the life cycle of the system which can be expected with a certain probability. This opens up another problem of the system of load cases the probability of occurrence. If one were to define as a load case all conceivable combinations of states and external conditions, i.e. of the hurricane of the century with simultaneously occurring especially bad operating conditions, the design process would be carried ad absurdum. The load cases on which the design is based, and thus, naturally, also the failure of the system, are turned into a question of statistically based probabilities. Naturally, this applies not only to wind turbines but to all technical systems and structures.
