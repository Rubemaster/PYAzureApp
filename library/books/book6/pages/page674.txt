Fig. 16.18. Shortterm drop in wind power feedin in the control zone of Eon on 19.11.2003 23;16.4.2 Adaption of the Utility Grids to Renewable Energy Utilisation;In Europe, the national interconnected grids are networked together so that power can be shifted today over great distances and beyond the national boundaries. However, the technical structure of the grids has grown over decades and caters for a particular power generating structure.;Power is being fed in at relatively few points with large power stations. From there,the current is conducted over large conductors to the big consumers and over wide dis tances through weak peripheral sections into rural regions, especially the coastal regions. However, wind power generation, and also many other future decentralized renewable energy generating systems, are located in precisely these remote regions. The trend of the flow of energy is, therefore, reversed. The expansion of the renewable ener gies must thus be accompanied by a reconfiguration of the interconnected grid. This is an absolute requirement if it is intended to achieve an increased share in renewable energies. In this connection, a number of different measures can be mentioned.;To manage the control problems and accomplish the power compensation, someutilities demand that the wind turbines be subjected to a generation management. In some local cases, it has also been found that temperature overloading of the lines, caus ing unacceptable sagging, is a limiting factor for the wind power fed in. Disconnec tion of the wind turbines by the utility or the grid operator under certain grid loading conditions is an unacceptable burden for many independent operators, however, since it makes the costeffectiveness of their investment even more difficult to calculate.
