7.4 DYNAMICS OF THE YAW SYSTEM 255was also the turbine design with a hingeless twobladed rotor and the associated large rotor yaw moments around the vertical axis.;In the resonance diagram, the natural frequency range was outside the area of criticalexcitation, not taking into account the play in the worm gear (Fig. 7.18). As soon as the play in the gears became perceptible after some hundreds of hours of operation, the natural frequency dropped drastically, and a resonance with the exciting aerodynamic moments of the rotor developed. Without considerable frictional damping or a yaw brake, such a vibration will destroy the yaw system after a short period of time. Passive aerodynamic yaw systems with fantail wheels and without yaw damping or brake are, therefore, seldom used today. The small Aeroman turbine, too, had to be retrofitted with an active yaw drive with yaw damping in the azimuth bearing. Large turbines generally have fewer problems with the dynamic behaviour of the yaw system.;Fig. 7.18. Resonance diagram of the yaw motion of Aeroman.
