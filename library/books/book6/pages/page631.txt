Like all large buildings, wind turbines, too, cast their shadow over the surroundings when the sun shines. In contrast to normal buildings, however, the shadow of a wind turbine has a peculiar feature which can be felt to be very annoying under certain condi tions. When the rotor is standing still, the wind turbine casts a stationary shadow just like any other building or like a tree (Fig. 15.11). Due to the rotation of the earth, this shadow moves and stays for only a short time at any particular point (the immission point). Normally, this shadow does not cause any problems and, in any case, only oc curs in the immediate vicinity of the turbine. When the rotor is turning, however, the situation changes. The rotor blades cutting through the sunlight at three times the fre quency of rotation of the rotor (in the case of a threebladed rotor) produce an unpleas ant flickering stroboscopic or disco effect when the shadow falls onto an observer.;If a number of operating turbines simultaneously cast their shadows onto an immissionpoint, this effect is cumulative and occurs at higher frequency. A shadow varying with time like this, shadow flicker, is one of those environmental effects of a wind turbine which are considered to be acceptable but only within certain limits.
