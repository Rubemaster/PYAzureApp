17.3 OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY IN THE NORTH SEA AND IN THE BALTIC SEA 713for determining the meteorological and maritime parameters. Not far from this platform, the first project, which still has the nature of a research and pilot project, has been im plemented. The Alpha Ventus wind park was erected by the OffshoreWindenergie trust managed by Eon and includes 12 turbines of the 5MW class from different manufacturers (Repower and Multibrid). The completion of the project was planned for 2008 and achieved in 2009. The final construction costs amounted to about  250 mil lion (Fig. 17.36). The project does not yet, therefore, reach the threshold of economic viability by a wide margin. Nevertheless, it represents an important milestone for the German offshore utilization of wind energy. It is especially the trial of the 5MW class under genuine offshore conditions which is of importance for all further undertakings.;In 2011 the first wind park has been installed in the German EEZ in the Baltic Sea,not far away from the city of Rostock (Fig. 17.32). It consists of 21 Siemens 2.3 MW wind turbines.;Fig. 17.32. Baltic I in the Baltic Sea with 21 Siemens wind turbines each 2.3 MW, 2011 (Sie mens);Naturally, the countries adjoining the North Sea and the Baltic Sea also include coun tries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and, not lastly, also Poland and the Baltic states. The first offshore projects built are located in Holland (Egmond aan Zee, Princess Amalie (Q7)) and in Sweden (Utgrunden, Lillgrund). Both these countries have concrete plans for the further expansion of their offshore wind energy utilization. It can be expected that the other countries will also follow their example soon.
