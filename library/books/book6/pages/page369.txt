9.8 GEARBOX 355subjected to the corresponding dynamic load spectrum. From the point of view of gear strength, the equivalent torque thus defined corresponds to the maximum transferable continuous torque of the gearbox.;Hence, the application factor is an external applicationrelated load parameter for thegearbox. It includes all the forces which are introduced into the gearbox from the out side over and above the peripheral force at rated power. Internal gearbox reliability aspects are not covered by it and must be additionally taken into consideration by the manufacturer. This does not yet cover the internal reliability factors for gears which must be additionally taken into consideration by the gearbox manufacturer. If no load spectrum is available, the application factor KA, and with it the equivalent torque, must be determined empirically from comparisons with similar cases of application (Table 9.48).; Number of rotor blades,  Type of rotor power control (blade pitch or stall control),  Function of the rotor hub on twobladed rotors. The following must be taken into consideration on the gearbox output side   Shockabsorbing flexible elements in the highspeed generator drive shaft,  Compliance of the electrical coupling to the grid (generator type),  Influences from the electrical grid.;Table 9.48.
