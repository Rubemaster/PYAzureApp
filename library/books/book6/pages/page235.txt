220 CHAPTER 6 LOADS AND STRUCTURAL STRESSEShinges between the rotor blades and the rotor hub. This makes it possible to control the pitch angle of each individual rotor blades periodically via the rotational cycle or, even better, in dependence on loading, in such a manner that the alternating loading can be corrected by the amplitude profile of the wind velocity or any other asymmetric rotor loading (s. Chapt. 6.8.4).;6.8.3 Stiffness of the Rotor Blades;It is obvious that the existing flexural elasticity of the rotor blades can be used to reduce the symmetrical and asymmetrical external loads. This method has been applied suc cessfully with helicopter rotors where the introduction of elastic rotor blade root hinges allows the rotor blades to perform a flapping motion. Generally, an appropriately tuned rotor blade bending elasticity over the entire blade length can have the same effect.;On wind rotors, the practical implementation of this solution is not easy. It is difficultto achieve a high bending elasticity of the blades without coupling together several degrees of elastic freedom, including undesirable ones. The aeroelastic behaviour is then difficult to control, above all with respect to blade pitch control. In addition, the fullload deflection can become so great that the free space between the blade tips and the tower becomes a critical design criterion.;In principle, using the bending elasticity of the rotor blades specifically as a meansfor reducing the dynamic loading is independent of the number of rotor blades. It can also be used for reducing the level of dynamic loading for threebladed rotors. This effect is also increasingly taken into account in the design of more recent turbines. For example, the rotor blades of the large Vestas turbines are relatively flexible. This design absorbs the loads more softly and saves weight in the rotor blades (Fig. 6.31).
