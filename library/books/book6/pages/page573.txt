14.2 DETERMINATION OF THE POWER CURVE 563the other hand, the power curve is worse than expected at low wind speeds. Moreover, stallcontrolled turbines often have a very individual power curve. Small construc tional variations in the rotor blades or soiling in operation have a much greater influence on the power curve than in the case of turbines with blade pitch control (s. Chapt. 5).;Wind turbines having a power curve based only on theoretical calculations are sold only in exceptional cases. The power curves of all commercial wind turbines are measured and certified by independent institutions in connection with their type approval (Chapt. 14.6.8). In Europe, this has become the special task of the national wind energy insti tutes, the Deutsche WindenergieInstitut (DEWI) and the WindtestKaiserWilhelm Koog in Germany, the National Institute and Wind Turbine Test Station Ris in Denmark and the Dutch Energy Research Institute (ECN) Petten in the Netherlands. These institutes are linked via an organisation (MEASNET) initiated by the EU Com mission and are continuously working on the improvement and standardisation of the measuring methods 4.;The measurement of the power curve has its own particular difficulties. Because ofthe great importance of the power curve and its accuracy the main influences on the measurement procedure and the results shall be mentioned here. The IEC 61400121 comprises a detailed description of the procedures, test equipment, and in particular of the unavoidable uncertainties of the results.
