6.6 STRUCTURAL STRESSES IN THE WIND TURBINE 207these transitions result in additional stress amplitudes. In this example the maximum amplitude excursion is evidently created by the transition from operation at rated power to shutdown. To each load case, load cycle numbers are assigned which are deduced from assumptions about the frequency of occurrence of the operating cycle within the life span and from the proportion of time occupied by each load case in the operating sequence. They range from around 104 for the occurrence of rare events such as extreme wind shear, up to around 108 for the alternating bending load at partialload wind speed.;Figure 6.24 shows an example of a measured load or stress spectrum as it is normallyrepresented. The material stress measured at the rotor blades of the WKA60 turbine has been plotted against load cycle numbers. In the form shown, the load spectrum is re ferred to the period of one hour and, therefore, be projected to a service life of 30 years, corresponding to about 108 load cycles, for assessing the fatigue situation. The two curves for the flapwise and chordwise components of the bending stress show dearly that the chordwise bending component is almost exclusively determined by the constant amplitude of the gravitational loading, whereas the flapwise component is determined by the aerodynamic loading and hence has a varying amplitude.;Such load or stress spectra must be prepared theoretically for every structural component subjected to dynamic stress, but in any case for the rotor blades and hub, the main shaft and gear box and possibly also for the highly stressed components of the yaw system. On the other hand, the computation work must be restricted to an amount that makes economic sense. In the case of small systems, therefore, simplified methods will be used.
