In the search for suitable energy storage methods for wind turbines, the question re mains of whether there is not at least one method which can be realised economically by the technical means currently available. From the technological point of view, the an swer is disappointing. The fact is that the oldest method of energy storage is also the only one today which can be used economically under certain circumstances. A water reservoir for energy storage offers the best preconditions for storing wind energy eco nomically over a longer period of time.;If water is used as energy storage medium, several applications such as water pumps,seawater desalination or room heating can be realised in standalone situations. Large scale concepts are also conceivable, if the topographical conditions are favourable. Figure 16.2 shows an earlier, but still interesting, proposal from Holland, which could be realised economically, in this way or in a similar form, due to the natural circum stances and already existing reservoirs. The proposal includes a pumped storage basin in the Ijsselmeer, on the dam walls of which a large number of wind turbines are to be accommodated 6.
