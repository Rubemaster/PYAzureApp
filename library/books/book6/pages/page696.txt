A special type of construction which exhibits features both of the jacket type and ofthe tripod type of construction was chosen for the BARD offshore installation. It is called tripile foundation (Fig. 17.10).;Floating platforms on the high seas are also proposed for offshore wind energy utilisa tion. Such platforms, which are attached to the sea floor by means of lines, are known in offshore technology. They are not an economic alternative for wind turbines in the water depths currently seriously considered for offshore wind energy utilisation. In addition, the dynamic characteristics of the turbine become more complicated due to the movement of the floating platform.
