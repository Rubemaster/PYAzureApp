224 CHAPTER 6 LOADS AND STRUCTURAL STRESSESelasticity, adequate damping is required to keep the vibrational behaviour under control. Torsionally elastic gearbox suspensions were to be found in some large, experimental firstgeneration wind turbines (Chapt. 8.9). The gearbox was able to respond to an instan taneous torque peak with a torsional freedom of about 20 to 30 degrees to smooth out the load peak.;The gearboxes in todays wind turbines are mounted much more simply and inexpensively in elastic rubber bodies (s.a. Chapt. 8.8.4 and Fig. 8.44). Although this type of mounting is primarily used for preventing the transmission of structureborne sound and for decoupling the vibration characteristics, dynamic load peaks are also removed, even if only to a limited extent.;An even more effective torsional compliance, being more strongly damped, is achieved by installing a hydraulic coupling in the mechanical drive train. Couplings of this type have a rotational slip of around 2 to 3 , as a rule. A combination of a synchronous generator coupled directly to the grid and hydraulic coupling in the mechanical drive train has been used in the past in several types of turbines, for example the earlier How den HWP330 and the Westinghouse WWG0600 or the MOD0 turbine (Chapt. 8.9). Using the MOD0 turbine as an example, Figure 6.33 shows the effect of a hydraulic coupling with respect to power output smoothing. Drive trains including a hydraulic coupling are also found in some recent designs (General Electric). Obviously the possi bility of using a synchronous standard generator is considered as an advantage.
