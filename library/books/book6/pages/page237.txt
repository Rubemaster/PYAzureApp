222 CHAPTER 6 LOADS AND STRUCTURAL STRESSESintroduced in seriesproduced wind turbines. There are ongoing attempts but the technical complexity is very high. A satisfactory solution remains a challenge for the designers.;Using such a control method makes it possible to compensate for asymmetric rotorloads. For example, the periodically cyclic alternating loading resulting from the verti cal wind shear could be compensated for by applying a cyclic change in pitch angle superimposed on the normal control function. However, a cyclic change in pitch angle would not compensate for other asymmetric rotor inflows occurring stochastically. This could only be achieved by using a loaddependent and completely individual control system for each single rotor blade.;In recent years, the leading manufacturers such as Vestas or General Electric haveundertaken trials with an individual blade pitch control system. This type of control was provided for the Vestas V90 unit but has not yet been adopted in series production to the present day. As explained later an individual blade pitch control would be of special significance especially for twobladed rotors. Large twobladed rotors such as could be
