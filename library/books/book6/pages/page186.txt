The sources of loading to be taken into account are aerodynamic, gravitational and inertial loads. There are also loads arising from operational actions and different opera tional states of the wind turbine. In the worst case, many of these sources produce loads simultaneously resulting in cumulative effects.;The complex load spectrum of the rotor and the entire wind turbine becomes comprehensible only when the total loading is mentally resolved into components whose origins are independent of one other. This applies both to the loads due to aerodynamic forces and to those resulting from gravitational and inertial forces. As regards the aero dynamic loads, the load situation is determined by the varying flow conditions acting on the rotor.
