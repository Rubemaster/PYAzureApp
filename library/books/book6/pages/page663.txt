The largest and technically most sophisticated winddiesel system so far was built onthe German North Sea island of Heligoland. The energy and water supply of the island of Heligoland with its population of approximately 2000 was completely reorganised between 1988 and 1990 17. The supply system was based on two diesel generators with 1800 kW each, the waste heat of which was recovered for the local district heating system. In addition, a large WKA60 type wind turbine was used as a fuel saver for the diesel engines. In times when the wind energy exceeded the instantaneous load in the grid, the electrical energy was used for powering a seawater desalination plant and the drinking water produced there was stored. In this way, the overall system also had an, albeit limited, energy storage capacity (Fig. 16.11).;The wind turbine was modified especially for this application. The turbines synchronous generator with a static frequency converter was operated at variable speed over a relatively wide range of speeds. Considering the high windpower input in the small, isolated grid, the resultant smoothed power output was an essential precondition for overall system control interaction with the diesel generators.;Moreover, the wind turbine was equipped with an autonomous reactive power supply, a synchronous generator in parallel operation, and the harmonic frequencies pro duced by the inverter were largely filtered out (s. Chapt. 9, Fig. 9.20).
