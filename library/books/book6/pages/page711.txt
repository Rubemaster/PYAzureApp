The higher wind speeds above the sea and the almost unrestricted space available are essential incentives for the offshore siting of wind turbines. Figure 17.25 provides an overview of the wind conditions off the coasts of Europe. At a distance of more than 10 km from the North Sea coast, mean annual wind speeds of more than 8 ms at a height of 60 m are specified in the southern region. In the north, the mean wind speeds are approximately 1 ms above this value 3. Above the Baltic Sea, the mean wind speed is generally somewhat less. It increases from west to east and off the Baltic countries it reaches similar values as in the southern region of the North Sea.;The immediate area off the coast up to a distance of about 10 km into the sea requiresspecial attention with respect to the wind conditions. More recent investigations show that it is in this region that the transition from the wind conditions on land, particularly with the gradient of the increase in wind speed with height, to the conditions prevailing over the open sea takes place 16. In other words the wind turbines must be sited at this distance from the land in order to be able to exploit the offshore wind as effectively as possible. It is only then that an energy yield of 30 to 40  higher than that on land can be expected. This finding is of special significance for the Baltic Sea coast since offshore sites directly off the coast are possible due to the absence of tidal shallows and mud flats.;The frequency distribution of the wind speed can be described according to a Weibulldistribution with a shape factor of k  2.0 to 2.2. Depending on position, the prevailing wind direction varies between Southwest and Northwest. Because of the lower surface roughness, the wind speed increases more rapidly with height than on land. The average roughness length is only about 0.003 m. The corresponding Hellmann exponent is within a
