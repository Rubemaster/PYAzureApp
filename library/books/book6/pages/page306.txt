As the size of the rotor blades increased, the filament winding technique was considered to be no longer advantageous. In the meantime, however, this technique is being used again in certain areas of the rotor blades. For example, Vestas uses partially wound spars for their rotor blades (s.a. Chapt. 8.4.2). The filament winding technique has the advantage that the production process is largely mechanized. During the winding
