The equivalent mechanical models for the electrical grid coupling of the drive trainshow that, in addition to the generator type, the operational mode, too, must be taken into consideration. This results in different natural frequencies and vibration modes, depending on the load condition.;7.3.3 Natural Frequencies and Vibration Modes;The models and calculation method outlined above provide the natural torsional frequen cies and with them the vibration modes (eigenmodes) of the drive train as the most im portant results. Depending on the type of electrical grid coupling or, in isolated operation, on the type of load characteristics, typical vibration modes are obtained. These are shown in Fig. 7.12 calculated by means of a threebody model.;The rotational speed of the generator rotor fluctuates around the grid frequency, the drive train masses vibrate in opposition to one another. Given the usual mass conditions of a horizontalaxis turbine, the following characteristic vibration modes are obtained  At the first natural frequency, the entire drive train vibrates in opposition to thefixedfrequency grid.
