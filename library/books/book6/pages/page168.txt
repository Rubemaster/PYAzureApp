Yawing with the aid of a fantail wheel has already been successfully used in the Dutch windmills. Nowadays, this method can still be found in some smaller turbines (Fig. 5.61). However, they also have considerable disadvantages. Fantails and worm gears are relatively expensive components. Moreover, the yawing moment around the vertical axis of the rotor must be held by the teeth of the worm gear. Play in the worm gear, which is unavoidable, can cause vibrations around the azimuth axis (Chapt. 11.3.2). Many failures of older turbines with fantails are attributable to this effect. Fit ting a fantail on one side also has the additional disadvantage of a not quite symmetrical yawing behaviour which is why two fantails have been used in some turbines. Wind vanes or fantails are not found in larger turbines. The complexity of these components increases with the size of the turbine. If they are to be effective in moving towerhead masses of several tens of tons and overcoming the aerodynamic yawing moments of the rotor with a diameter of more than 30 m, they become very large. This especially applies to upwind rotors.
