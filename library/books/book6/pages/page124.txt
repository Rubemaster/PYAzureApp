In contrast, model B operated with a continuously controlled blade pitch angle settings towards feather. Practical experience has shown that this method, which had al ready been used with earlier turbines (SmithPutnam, Htter W 34, etc), leads to a much steadier operation which is why almost all the larger wind turbines have this type of power control. Using continuous blade pitch control, the electrical output power can be kept at a constant level at wind speeds from rated wind speed up to cutout wind speed. Figure 5.21 shows the power curves of the Nibe A and Nibe B turbines.;The continuous adjustment of the blade pitch angle towards the feathered positionprovides for an effective and precise control of the output power and, if necessary, also of the rotor speed over a wide range of wind velocities. Control of the rotor speed is of importance when the electrical generator is not connected to a fixedfrequency grid which would otherwise govern the rotor speed. This mode of operation has to be used while the rotor accelerates up to the speed of synchronization with the grid fre quency and when the wind turbine is operated in isolation (standalone mode) (s. Chapt. 10.3.3).;Fig. 5.21. Power output versus wind speed (power curve) of Nibe A with stalllimited power input and of Nibe B with continuous blade pitch control 13.;Adjusting the pitch angle towards the feathered position offers further advantages. Aspower control takes effect above the rated wind speed, rotor thrust drops markedly, while this is hardly the case with stallregulated rotors (Fig. 5.22). In addition, the rotor blades can be feathered completely when wind speeds are extremely high, thus greatly reducing the wind loading on the rotor blades and on the entire turbine.
