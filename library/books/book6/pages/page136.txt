The aerodynamic properties of the airfoils are measured on models in the wind tunnel. Lift and drag coefficients are measured as a function of the angle of attack up to the socalled critical angle of attack at which the flow separates from upper surface of the airfoil. Moreover, the aerodynamic moment coefficient cM is measured in the wind tun nel and is determined in relation to the socalled t4 point (25  of the chord length from the leading edge). The aerodynamic force and moment coefficients are plotted in the form of socalled polar airfoil curves.;There are two common polar representations. The first one shows the variation of cL,cD and cM versus the angle of attack, a resolved polar curve which occasionally is still called Lilienthal polar diagram (Fig. 5.33). The second one represents the direct interrelationship between the aerodynamic coefficients (Fig. 5.34). The angle of attack is entered in the curves as a parameter. One advantage of this type of plot is that the optimum lift to drag ratio can be visually identified as the tangent to the curve.;Apart from airfoil geometry, the polar airfoil curves are also influenced by the flowparameters, the main one of which is the Reynolds number. It is used as similarity pa rameter for the transferability of model measurements in the wind tunnel to the flow conditions at the original object. The Reynolds number is defined as;V  kinematic air viscosity (m2s) at m.s.l. v  1.5  105 (ms)
