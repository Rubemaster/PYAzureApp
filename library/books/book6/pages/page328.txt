Since about 1995, wind turbines with gearless drive train arrangements have been pro duced in series by the German manufacturer Enercon and have been successfully oper ated. In the meantime, other manufacturers have adopted this type of design so that it has become established as second standard design.;The turbines have variablespeed, directly rotordriven synchronous generators withfrequency converters. Due to the provision of the converter, the generator does not need to be designed for the 50 or 60 Hz grid frequency so that the required number of poles, and thus the diameter, remains within tolerable limits. The main argument in favour of this type of design is that the mechanically most complex component of a wind turbine, the gearbox, is no longer present. Even though the production costs of the turbine cannot be reduced this way because of the more elaborate generator required, the gearbox is no longer a bothersome item in operation. This is a weighty argument even though the advocates for the traditional design rightly point out that when mechanical transmission gears are properly designed and main tained, they can perfectly well meet the requirements set with respect to reliability and service life.;The Enercon turbines have variablespeed, directly rotordriven synchronous generators with electrically excited poles connected to a frequency converters. The system was developed in the early Nineties. The first wind turbine featuring this kind of generator system was the Enercon E40 (Fig. 9.7). The turbine with a rotor diameter of 40 m had a rated power of 500 kW. This wind turbine proofed immediately to be an effective and
