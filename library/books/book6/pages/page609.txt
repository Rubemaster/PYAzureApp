The only factor speaking against a high rated power is basically the increasing loadlevel with increasing rated power. However, this influence is very difficult to assess. It is undisputed that the load on the turbine increases with increasing generator power or increasing generator torque but it is hardly possible to make any generally valid state ments as to what extent this is the case and which influence this has on the costs of the turbine.;The turbines technical concept plays a certain role. A stiff and heavy concept, the dimensioning of which is largely determined by the components natural weight, reacts much less sensitively to a high rated power level than does a lightweight construction. For this reason, high ratios of rated power to rotor area can be found mainly in the older heavily built wind turbines of the Danish line, whereas lightweight turbines are very restrained with respect to installed generator power.;From the aerodynamic point of view, the maximum possible theoretical energy output isobtained with an infinitely high generator power. In practice, however, the poorer electri cal efficiency at partial load operation increasingly leads to a decreasing energy yield when the ratio of rated power to rotor area becomes very high.;1500 kW or to an installed power of approx. 2000 kW with a 90 m rotor.
