13.4 CHARACTERISTIC PARAMETERS OF THE WIND 521by the characteristics of the Ekman layer. This fact was scarcely considered at the be ginning of wind energy utilisation and is one reason why the simple, older mathematical approaches like the logarithmic height formula for the increase in wind velocity with height were too inaccurate. As a rule, they underestimated the wind velocity above 100 m altitude, an effect which occurred mainly at inland sites.;The instantaneous increase in wind speed with elevation in the lower atmosphere depends on a number of meteorological factors, e.g., temperature layering and humidity. These largely determine the socalled atmospheric stability. However, the mean value to be expected statistically over a long term at a particular height is largely determined by the roughness of the earths surface (Chapt. 14.6.6). The roughness of the earths surface is defined by the socalled roughness length z0 that is specified in metres (Table 13.16).;The increase in wind speed with height can be described as the statistical mean of anassumed steadystate speed distribution. This simplification is adequate with respect to problems based on the longterm statistical mean of the wind speed, that is to say the calculation of the energy yield of a wind turbine. Naturally, instantaneous fluctuations that
