17.1 IMPORTANT TECHNICAL ISSUES OF OFFSHORE SITING 693highvoltage. DC transmission (HVDCT) is being considered as an alternative (Fig. 17.16). HVDCT avoids the problems associated with power factor compensation and the decrease in efficiency. However, all the systems and components such as switches etc. are much more expensive in this case. Furthermore the change to a different voltage level cannot be accomplished by direct means. Transformation is only possible via an expensive and lossy inverter followed by later rectification.;Fig. 17.16. Submarine coaxial DC cable power transmission capacity 800 MW, diameter 180 mm, weight approx. 90 kgm 10;In current HVDCT systems, thyristor inverters are used. These have the disadvantage that,for connecting wind farms with an internal alternatingvoltage power system, the reactive power cannot be regulated. The inverters can only be used as linecommutated inverters so that a separate isolated AC power system must be set up in the wind farm. Thyristor inverters also generate harmonics that require special filtering.;These are used in connection with a voltagecontrolled converter instead of a current controller converter. These socalled HVDCT light systems are already used in some cases 11.
