For the current projects, the array cabling of an offshore wind farm is a mediumvoltage threephase system with a voltage range of from 30 to 40 kV. The sea cables are 3core cables with integrated fibreoptical signal conductor. There are socalled XLPE cables with a round cross section and flattype cables in which the three conductors are next to one another in one plane.;The laying amounts to about the same of costs so that one metre of laid mediumvoltage sea cable costs 300 to 500 US per metre. The cables are laid by means of specially equipped cablelaying ships. According to an often used method, the cables are driven into the sea bottom to a depth of about one metre by means of a water jet.;On an offshore site, ring connections are suitable for a certain number of wind turbines up to about 30 to 40 MW per connecting ring according to the maximum transmission capacity of the cable cross sections selected. Ring connections have the advantage that in the event of a break in the cable, the wind turbines behind it are not lost but can be switched over via the ring, in contrast to the daisy chain connection normally used in wind farms on land (Fig. 17.12).;In principle, an internal DC power system is also conceivable. However, this onlymakes sense if every wind turbine is connected by means of a regulated rectifier and the connection to the land is also constructed as DC transmission line. This option may become interesting in future in the case of wind turbines operated with variable speed, which have a DC link circuit, and if the wind farm is located at a great distance from the coast.
