If the rotor is to fully capture the power from the wind, it must be oriented correctly with respect to the wind direction. A yaw angle, i.e. an angle deviation between rotor axis and wind direction, causes a marked loss of power. The rotor can be oriented into the wind by three different methods; yawing by aerodynamic means wind vanes or fantail wheels,  active yawing with the help of a motorized yaw drive,  free yawing of rotors located downwind.  Yawing with the help of a wind vane is the simplest method. It is feasible for small turbines with a diameter of a few meters where it has indeed been successfully em ployed. In larger turbines, however, the wind vane must be uneconomically large to yaw and stabilize the rotor and the nacelle effectively enough. Nevertheless, some manufac turers occasionally attempt to use wind vanes even for larger turbines (Fig. 5.60).
