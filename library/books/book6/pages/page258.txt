In some cases the investigation of the vibrational behaviour of the drive train requiresa simulation of a comprehensive system simulation including rotor blades, rotor hub, rotor shaft, gearbox with support structure and electrical generator. The resulting values of such a multibody simulation in the time domain method is particularly helpful to detect undesirable vibration modes of the higher order. This kind of simulation is also a tool in the design optimisation process of the gearbox regarding bearings, shafts and gears as well as the stiffness of the gearbox housing and support structure.;Simulation in the time domain mode also offers the possibility of investigating the influence of different operational modes and external loads, for example the loading in the case of an emergency rotor stop, the influence of heavy wind gusts or a sudden loss of the load due to a grid failure. Changing speeds and torques in the gearbox can have a signifi cant influence on the dynamic behaviour and on the loading on the drive train. These affects only can be found by the aid of a simulation.;Apart from the gearbox the other components of the mechanical drive train, rotorshaft, the hub with regard to stiffness and last but not least the bearings are affected by the vibrational behavior of the drive train. In particular the bearings can be affected by vibrations at a certain operational status of the wind turbine. Torsional vibrations of the drive train together with low loading on the bearings (idling of the turbine) can cause slipping movements of the bearings. This effect has very negative consequences for the life time of the bearings (s. Chapt. 9.6.1).
