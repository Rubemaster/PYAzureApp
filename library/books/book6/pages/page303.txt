The properties of the resins also affect the surface protection of the components. Good surface protection is an important factor especially in the case of rotor blades which are exposed to environmental influences to a considerable extent. At present, socalled gelcoats are widely used which, also based on synthetic resins, are inserted as the top layer in the production mould so that a smooth and permanent surface is produced without further painting.;8.4.2 Structural Design of the Rotor Blades;The structural design of todays rotor blades essentially follows the models of aircraft construction (Fig. 8.18). In the simplest case the blade cross section is a hollow shell formed by an upper and a lower half shell. The shape of the shell follows the aerody namic requirements (Fig. 8.11). A hollow shell structure can resist very good torsional loads but it is not strong enough to withstand outofplane loads. For this reason the rotor blades incorporate one or more shear spar webs which bear this kind of loads. The arrangement of the webs varies from one single web to two or three webs distributed over the blade chord length and includes also boxlike structures. The webs consist of laminated composite material. The shells are produced in sandwich construction, i.e. only the outer layers consist of hard fibre composites whilst a softer support material is used on the inside  the only way to achieve a low weight.;The spar webs or spar boxes are manufactured separately and, after the lower shellhas been moulded, are inserted into it and bonded to it. In the outer, thinner blade sec tions foam material or balsa wood is also used instead of webs. The webs and spar boxes absorb the largest proportion of the load, particularly the bending moment which is why special care must be exercised during the process of manufacture and bonding with the rotor blade shells.
