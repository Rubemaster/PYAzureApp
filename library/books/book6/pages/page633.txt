Naturally, the astronomically possible duration of shadow casting is considerably reduced in practice by the prevailing weather conditions. Taking into consideration the statistical weather conditions with respect to the frequency distribution of the wind direction and the hours of sunshine, the effective shadow period is reduced to 20 to 30  of the astronomically possible maximum period at Central European latitudes. Statis tically, the permissible 30 hours annually become only 6 to 9 hours per year.;Todays large wind turbines can be equipped with an automatic shadow cutout system. This is programmed with the astronomically possible shadowcasting times and switches off the turbine with the aid of a light sensor as soon as the weather situation allows a shadow to be cast at a critical point. Keeping in mind the statistically low num ber of hours involved, the loss in energy yield is virtually negligible. In the worst case, it amounts to one to two percent of the annual energy yield.
