 Highvoltage, e.g. 380 kV, 220 kV, 110 kV,;The lowloss transportation of large amounts of electric energy at the highvoltage and extrahighvoltage level is carried out in Europe by interconnected grid, intended to be fed by large, centralised power stations. Large wind farm projects with more than 10 to 15 MW power must normally be connected to the highvoltage grid (110 kV). In some rare cases, connection to the extrahighvoltage system (380 kV) will also be necessary. Connection to the highvoltage system means in many cases that the wind farm will require a new transformer substation.;Starting from the higher highvoltage level, the mediumvoltage grid handles the regional distribution of the electric energy. Commonly, its voltage level is 20 kV. Grid density and transmission capacity decrease from conurbations to rural areas which is why the branches of the mediumvoltage grid in the regions of the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts with the most wind are frequently not designed for taking large power
