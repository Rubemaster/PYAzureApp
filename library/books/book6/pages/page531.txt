13.4.2 Increase in Wind Speed with Altitude;One of the most important phenomena with respect to the utilisation of wind energy is the increase in wind speed with altitude. The friction of the moving air masses against the earths surface slows down the wind speed from an undisturbed value at great alti tude (geostrophic wind) to zero directly at ground level. Depending on the time of day and atmospheric conditions, the range up to where the wind speed is undisturbed is between 600 and 2000 m above ground and is called the atmospheric boundary layer (Chapt. 13.1).;(Fig. 13.15). The flow conditions in this area are dominated by the friction of the air flow against the earths surface. In addition, the vertical transportation of heat and im pulse in this area plays an important role.;The area lying above the Prandtl layer is called Ekman layer in meteorology. The influence of ground friction is already less dominant here, whilst the wind direction is influenced by the Coriolis forces, which generate the socalled Ekman spiral.;The height of the Prandtl layer varies with the meteorological conditions. During thenocturnal hours, it is only 20 to 50 m thick whereas during the day, the vertical extent is, between 50 and 150 m. Investigations have shown that, for example, a rotor hub height of 60 m is within the Prandtl layer for only about 30  of the annual hours whereas it is only about 7  at a hub height of 100 m. The wind conditions of large turbines with 100 m and more hub height are, therefore, already extensively influenced
