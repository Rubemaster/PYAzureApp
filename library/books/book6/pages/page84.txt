68 CHAPTER 3 BASIC CONCEPTS OF WIND ENERGY CONVERTERScountered by disadvantages such as its low tipspeed ratio, its inability to selfstart and not being able to control power output or speed by pitching the rotor blades. A variation of the Darrieus rotor is the socalled Hrotor. Instead of curved rotor blades, straight blades connected to the rotor shaft by struts are used. Attempts were made particularly in the UK, in the US and in Germany to develop this design to commercial maturity. Based on plans of the British engineer Musgrove, Hrotors with variable rotor geometry were also tested in order to permit at least a rough degree of power and speed control 2. However, to the present day, the production costs of these systems are still so high that they cannot compete with horizontalaxis rotors (Chapt. 5.7). Hrotors of a particularly simple structure, with the permanently excited generator integrated directly into the rotor structure without intermediary gearbox, were developed by a German manufacturer up
