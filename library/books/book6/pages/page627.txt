These values apply to modern turbines which have already been designed with a view towards low noise emission. Earlier wind turbines frequently exceed these values con siderably. The first generation of large experimental wind turbines, in particular, pro duced noise values of up to 120 dB(A) (Fig. 15.5). The limits within which the sound power level can be influenced by technical or operational parameters are illustrated by the example of an acoustic investigation carried out on a mediumsized wind turbine. The dependence of the sound power level on the wind speed or the electric power out put is relatively small (Figs. 15.6 and 15.7).;The result of a sound propagation calculation, i.e. the expected sound pressure level;The result of a sound propagation calculation, i.e. the expected sound pressure levelas a function of distance, for the TW 600, shows that the commonly demanded maxi mum value of 45 dB(A) is obtained at a distance of about 220 m (Fig. 15.8). In order to remain below the standard acoustic limit value of 45 dB(A), a minimum distance of about 200 m is typical for mediumsized wind turbines in the power class of around 500 kW.
