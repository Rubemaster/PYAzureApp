The second example shows the visualisation of the flow through the rotor. It illus trates the distribution of the velocity deficit caused by the energy extract of the rotor. It can be seen, that the velocity deficit is highest at about 70  of the rotor radius.;Consideration of rotor aerodynamics must also include the aerodynamic state of the flow behind the rotor. The wind turbines in a wind farm are so close together that the down wind turbines are affected by the wake of the upwind turbines. This interaction has a number of consequences which can be of considerable significance   The reduced mean flow velocity in the wake of the rotor reduces the energy output of;Consideration of rotor aerodynamics must also include the aerodynamic state of the flow behind the rotor. The wind turbines in a wind farm are so close together that the down wind turbines are affected by the wake of the upwind turbines. This interaction has a number of consequences which can be of considerable significance   The reduced mean flow velocity in the wake of the rotor reduces the energy output ofthe subsequent wind turbines.; The turbulence in the rotor wake, which is unavoidably increased, also increases theturbulence loading on the downwind turbines, with corresponding consequences for the fatigue strength of these turbines. On the other hand, their steadystate load level is re duced due to the decrease in the mean upwind velocity.; Under poor conditions, the influence of the rotor wake can affect the blade pitch anglecontrol of the relevant turbines in an undesirable way.  The treatment of the rotor wake firstly requires the conception of a physical mathematical model for calculating the wake of a single rotor. In a wind farm, this calculated wake is then superimposed in a suitable manner on the wake of the other turbine. The first useable model was published in 1977 by Lissaman in connection
