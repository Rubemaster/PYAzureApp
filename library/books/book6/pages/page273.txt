7.5 VIBRATION OF THE WHOLE WIND TURBINE 259therefore, almost the only one implemented today. A soft tower design is almost manda tory for large turbines for these reasons.;The following resonance diagrams (called Campbell diagrams in Englishlanguageliterature) can be described as the dynamic calling cards of the wind turbines. The numerical values indicated are not highly accurate. The data published by the individual manufacturers are not complete and are also based on not fully comparable precondi tions. Partly, the figures may be calculated results from the design stage determined, on the one hand, for isolated components, i.e. rotor blades, and, on the other hand, for sub systems, i.e. the rotating rotor. These values are set against measurement results from operational turbines. Their accuracy is, nevertheless, sufficient to provide an overview of the vibrational characteristics of the individual turbines.;(Fig. 7.21) were representatives of the stiff turbine design 7. The first natural bending frequency of the tower was located well above the rotors 2 P excitation frequency. The lattice towers, which had been used at that time, had the appropriate preconditions for this layout. Moreover, the lattice steel towers had extraordinary torsional stiffness, a characteristic which was definitely necessary in view of the hingeless twobladed rotors.;The secondgeneration MOD2 (Fig. 7.22) represented the transition to the flexibledesign. The first natural bending frequency of the tower was placed between the 1 P and 2 P excitation frequencies. The rotor incorporated a teetering hub avoiding the extreme yaw moments of the stiff rotor.
