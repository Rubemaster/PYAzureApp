The nature of the sea bottom is of importance for building the foundation of a wind turbine. In the area of the North Sea and Baltic Sea, the major part of the sea bottom consists of fine sand. This is interspersed with areas with coarser sand and relatively large accumulations of stones. If monopile foundations are used, the strength of the ground plays a role in the vibration characteristics of the wind turbine 3 (Chapt. 17.3.4).;In connection with the nature of the sea bottom, oceanic currents must be consideredwhich cause considerable displacements of the ground material in the case of a sand bottom and scouring in the case of obstacles (e.g. foundations). These effects can have considerable influence on the stability of the foundation. For these reasons, careful soil testing is an absolute requirement for any planning.;At the beginning of the discussion about siting wind turbines at sea, the prevailing opin ion was that on the open sea one could also escape from the constraints of the licens ing procedures delimiting wind energy utilisation on land. After the first plans became known and public discussion began, it immediately became clear that this was a mis taken hope. The doubts and objections and even tumultuous protests show that the in terests of the people with claims in the coastal regions of the countries are in conflict with one another in the same way as on land. At sea, too, numerous people with claims
