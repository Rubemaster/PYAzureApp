The success of the gearless drive train concept developed by Enercon has encouraged the developers of the technology of permanent magnets for electric generators for some years to use this type of generators in gearless designs. Its advocates rightly point out that the disadvantage of electrically excited multipole generators, their bulky construc tion, can be largely avoided by applying permanentmagnet technology. The advantages of permanentmagnet technology undoubtedly lie in the fact that it is possible to achieve high power densities in a very narrow space and the generators thus become much more compact. At the beginning of the nineties, the German manufacturer Heidelberg Magnetmo tor built some verticalaxis turbines with directdrive generator and permanent excita tion 7 but the concept of the wind turbines proved to be unsuccessful, regardless of the generator design, and this development was discontinued. Some years later, permanent magnet technology was developed for generators of commercial wind turbines, by several manufacturers of conventional electric motors and generators. Lowspeed generators with permanent magnet excitation are designed either with in ner rotor design, as usual, but also with outer rotor (i.e. Vensys) (Fig. 10.14). In the last case, the outer rotating ring contains the magnets. The advocates claim, that this type will lead to a more compact construction.;The electric efficiency of the lowspeed generators is somewhat less compared to the highspeed design. The bandwidth is higher depending on the specific design features. In any case the efficiency at partial load is superior to generators with electric excitation
