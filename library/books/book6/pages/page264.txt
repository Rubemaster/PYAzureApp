Apart from these external influences, the drive train vibrations can also have internal origins. Possible causes are mass imbalances of the rotating parts, and meshing frequen cies of the gearbox. Which of the excitation sources does indeed lead to hazardous resonances naturally depends on the actual numerical values of the natural and excitation frequencies. Small turbines with drive trains of relatively high stiffness react readily to internal excitation sources (Fig. 7.15). In the example shown, the
