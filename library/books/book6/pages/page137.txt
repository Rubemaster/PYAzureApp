Depending on the size of the rotors, the Reynolds numbers of wind rotors are withina range of 1 to 8 x 106 at the blade tip and thus also correspond to the values which are also applicable for the wings of slowflying aircrafts. For this reason, the airfoils for the rotor blades of wind turbines are borrowed from aviation to the present day.;As far as controlling the rotor by adjusting its blade pitch angle is concerned, the socalled torque behaviour of the airfoil must also be taken into consideration. Some highly cambered airfoils exhibit an undesirably great change in the aerodynamic torque as a function of the angle of attack. Their centre of pressure is not fixed which influ ences the pitching torques to be produced around the axis of rotation of the blade.
