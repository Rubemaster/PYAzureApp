A site with stronger wind, with a mean wind velocity of about 7 ms requires a specificpower output per unit area of 400 to 450 Wm2 in order to exploit about 90  of the poten tial. In the offshore area, mean wind velocities of up to 10 ms are achieved at rotor hub height. Under these extreme conditions, the specific power output per unit area should be between 800 and 900 Wm2 which would mean a generator power of about 10 MW for a turbine with a rotor diameter of 125 m. Current prototypes in this class are not installed at such a level but it can be expected that the development will head in this direction as in creasing experience is gained.;Within certain limits, a wind turbines tower height, even more than the installed genera tor power, is available for adaptation to various site requirements. If the tower meets the stiffness requirements with regard to the vibrational behaviour, its height can be adapted to the conditions prevailing at the site. The economic tower height depends on the local shearwind profile. In general, offshore sites and land sites close to the coast differ from typical inland sites. The increase in wind speed with height is higher at inland locations because of the greater roughness of the ground. Under these conditions, high towers are more effective on inland sites than near the coast. The tower heights of 100 m or more, which have been achieved for some years, are a decisive prerequisite for the economic utilisation of wind energy in inland areas (Fig. 14.42).
