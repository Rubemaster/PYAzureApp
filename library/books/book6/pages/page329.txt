The technical concept has been developed up to 7 MW wind turbines.;On the other hand, the disadvantages of the gearless design must not be overlooked. The electric generator is a complex specialpurpose design and its high weight and still com paratively large diameter lead to an overall turbine weight which is decidedly higher than in conventional turbine concepts. This applies at least to the electrically excited multipole generators as used in all Enercon turbines.;In recent years, the gearless design has won further backup from the use of generators with permanentfield excitation. The permanentmagnet generators are cheaper today than they were ten or twenty years ago and have much more compact dimensions (s. a. Chapt. 10.5.2). Using this generator design does away with the argument of a volumi nous and heavy nacelle which is why a number of manufacturers are contemplating this design.
