Naturally, the experimental load investigations also include measurements and testswhich can be carried out on test stands for individual components. Tests carried out on test stands have the invaluable advantage of conveying the correlation between set loads and the responses of the test objects under reproducible conditions. They are appropriate when ever unknown material properties, the interaction of different materials in a specific design, uncertainties concerning manufacturing techniques or even the verification of calculated results are to be investigated. The loads themselves must, however, be specified, i.e. their correctness must be assumed. Apart from testbed trials with gearboxes, or total mechanical drive trains, the rotor blades commonly are subject of testing on test beds.;To verify their mechanical properties and dynamic characteristics, newly developed rotor blades are tested on special test stands (Fig. 6.36). The static loading capacity of the blades is first verified experimentally and the precalculated stresses in the loadbearing structural elements are determined experimentally with the aid of strain gauges. The deflections measured are an additional criterion for checking the constructional design assumptions. Dynamic fatigue load spectra can only be simulated to a limited extent. The very high load cycle numbers in the lifetime of a wind turbine, combined with the associated amplitudes, can only be represented in elaborate longterm test programs. Only the critical elements of the design are, therefore, tested with a dynamic load spectrum, in the form of smaller test objects, for example the loadtransferring elements between the rotor blade structure and the hub. This makes it possible to test the overall design for its fatigue life at least in critical sections.
