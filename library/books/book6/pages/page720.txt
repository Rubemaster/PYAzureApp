2030, when they reach the planned capacity which provides for over 1000 MW per site. If this goal is achieved, Denmark would be able to cover 40 to 50  of the national power consumption from offshore wind energy utilisation alone. The first two projects, started in 2002, are located at the sites of Horns Rev in the North Sea and Redsand in the Baltic. Horns Rev was completed in the autumn of 2002. The operational experi ences revealed some severe technical problems. Generators and transformers did not withstand the salty environment, requiring a comprehensive retrofitting programme.;In Great Britain, it is intended to generate about 10  of the power consumption from renewable energies by the year 2010. Investigations of suitable offshore sites have been carried out for some years. Since 2003, developments have been accelerating very rap idly in this field.;The British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has initially licensed about 15sites in its socalled Round 1. These sites are located within the 12mile zone in rela tively shallow waters.;On the sites, about 30 turbines each are installed, the capacity of which will be between 60 and 100 MW depending on turbine size. Overall, about 450 MW will be in stalled in Round 1. At the end of 2003, further 15 sites were licensed in Round 2. These sites are located outside the 12mile zone in deeper waters and at a greater
