Although the mass of concrete towers is about four times higher compared to steel tow ers, the increase with height is less steep. With regard to the costs, the concrete type of construction shows a relatively strong dependence on the local situation. Closeness to a concrete mixing plant and the logistics involved play an important role. At present, concrete towers are produced with specific costs of between 400 to 600 US per tonne.;The dynamic characteristics of pure concrete tubes are the limiting factor with respect to the increasing height. The first bending eigenfrequency lowers due to the mass in the upper section. Considering the rotational speed of the rotor and thus the range of the exciting frequencies from the rotor, it becomes very difficult to avoid resonances (see Chapt. 12.7).
