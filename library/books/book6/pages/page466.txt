11.5 POWER LIMITING BY AERODYNAMIC STALL 453operational status of the turbine. If there is enough wind, the mechanical rotor brake is released and the rotor accelerates to the synchronous speed. The automatic synchroniz ing system connects the generator to the grid and operation under load commences. If the wind speed exceeds the permissible maximum operating value, the rotor is retarded mechanically and, in most cases, simultaneously turned out of the wind (furled). The turbine can survive extreme wind speeds in this position. In case of a grid failure, rotor overspeed will be prevented by releasing the aerodynamic brakes or pitching the rotor blades (s. Chapt. 7.7). Apart from controlling the operating cycle described, another task of the sequence controller is the monitoring of safetyrelated electrical and me chanical parameters such as grid voltage and frequency, generator and gearbox oil temperatures, or unacceptable amplitudes of vibration (s. Chapt. 14.6).;With some technical effort, wind turbines without blade pitch control are also capable of isolated operation. As the power capture of the rotor cannot be controlled, speed or frequency control can only be achieved by changing the generator load. As far as pos sible, the connected loads are connected to different load circuits for this purpose. However, these load circuits, as switchable load stages, are generally not enough for speed control, so that additional regulating resistors are necessary. Control with a high degree of constancy of frequency requires fast and accurate matching of the load to the wind power fluctuations. This requirement is met by tapped, quickly switched resistors (dump loads). Semiconductor switching elements are preferred due to the high switching frequencies (Fig. 11.17). If operating conditions in which the load circuits
