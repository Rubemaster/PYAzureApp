The question is how much mechanical energy can be extracted from the freestream airflow by an energy converter. As mechanical energy can only be extracted at the cost of the kinetic energy contained in the wind stream, this means that, with an unchanged mass flow, the flow velocity behind the wind energy converter must decrease. Reduced velocity, however, means at the same time a widening of the crosssection, as the same mass flow must pass through it. It is thus necessary to consider the conditions in front of and behind the converter (Fig. 4.1).
