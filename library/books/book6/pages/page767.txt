758 CHAPTER 18 WIND TURBINE INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONsystem, a cradle carrying the completely assembled nacelle plus rotor slid up the tower. This was done by means of a hydraulic pulling device which slowly lifted the weight of over 160 t to the 90m high tower top over a period of approximately 20 hours (Fig. 18.36). This erection method requires the solid concrete tower to carry the rail system and the pulling device. It also considerably affects the turbine design, which in turn involves additional costs.;Fig. 18.36. Erecting the AeolusI test turbine on the isle of Gotland (1981) An extraordinary assembly and erection procedure was used for the largest wind turbine at the time Growian (Fig. 18.37). The tower height of 100 m and a tower head mass of approximately 380 t precluded conventional erection methods with common cranes. At a very early design stage, a concept was, therefore, adopted where the tower passed through the nacelle during the lifting procedure. The nacelle plus rotor could thus be moved up and down on the tower by means of a hydraulic pulling device fixed at the top of the tower. This method was made possible by using a slender steel tubular tower with a diameter of 3.5 m.
