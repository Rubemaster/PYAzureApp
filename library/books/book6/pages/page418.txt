The slip of the induction generator provides the opportunity for implementing greater speed compliance. To do this, external resistors can be connected into the rotor circuit which normally requires a slip ring rotor. The external resistors will only be connected in order to produce the desired slip when the load on the wind turbine becomes high. Using external resistors instead of a rotor with higher slip also creates somewhat sim pler conditions for cooling the generator (Fig. 10.21).;Some types of Vestas turbines, for example, have such a dynamic slip control systemwhich is offered under the name Optislip. The resistors are softly connected into the rotor circuit of the induction generator, thus providing for a speed compliance of ap proximately 10  under turbulent wind conditions. As a special feature, corotating rotor resistors and control unit are mounted on the shaft of the generator which does away with the need for a slip ring rotor (Weier design). Quite generally, however, these solutions give rise to the question whether it wouldnt be more economic to use a variablespeed generator with inverter. Moreover, the loss of power is to be considered.
