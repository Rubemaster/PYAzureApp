To avoid the major disadvantage of the sitemixed type of construction, the long build ing time, various prefabrication methods have been developed in recent years. This makes it possible to shorten the building time considerably. A further advantage of prefabrication is that this makes it possible to build very high towers without causing insurmountable transportation problems as in the case of tubularsteel towers.;One prefabrication type of construction that is more frequently used for small andmediumsized wind turbines is the use of centrifugally cast concrete towers 5. The tower parts of up to 35 m length and 50 t weight are manufactured on special spinning machines and are also prestressed during this process (Fig. 12.24). The concrete and the reinforcement are introduced into moulds and spun. During this process, the reinforce ment can also be prestressed, resulting in a prestressedconcrete type of construction. The effect of the centrifugal forces during the spinning produces very dense concrete structures that are well suited to absorbing dynamic loads. The individual tower seg ments are transported to the site and placed on top of one another. A tower of, for ex ample, 50 m height consists of two or three segments and smaller towers are made of one piece.;Another method of prefabricating concrete towers is based on segments prefabricatedin the factory 6. The segments of approximately 3.8 m length are produced with con ventional formwork in the plant (Fig. 12.25). The segments are then placed on top of one another on site and bonded with a concreteresin mixture. The individual seg ments are provided with empty tubes distributed over their circumference into which tensioning ropes are inserted during the construction. These are used for additionally fixing and tensioning the segments. This type of prefabricated prestressedconcrete construction is also suitable for very high towers of 100 m and more (Fig. 12.26).
