Introducing the aerody namic forces acting on the rotor blades, and particularly the aerodynamic drag, further reduces the power coefficient in addition, the power coefficient now exhibits an opti mum value at a certain tip speed ratio.;The aerodynamic rotor theory based on the momentum theory and on the blade element theory, yields the real rotor power curve with good approximation. Nevertheless it should be kept in mind that the momentum theory as well as the blade element theory include several simplifications which limit their validity to a disc shaped wind energy converter. Sometimes the momentum theory is therefore called disc actuator theory.;The propeller type rotor is very close to this model, but not all the other unconventional designs acting as wind energy converters, are discshaped devices, converting the wind energy to mechanical energy in one step. The blade element theory cannot be used for a detailed determination of more complex flow processes which have a certain influ ence on the power delivery and the behaviour of the rotor under certain flow and operat ing conditions, because   the spatial flow around the rotor blades or the entire rotor, respectively, is not detected.;The flow around the blade tip and the rotor hub are considered only very roughly by way of semiempirical formulae for the blade tip and rotor hub losses (s.a.
