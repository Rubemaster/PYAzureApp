20.2 POWER PRODUCTION COSTS AND REPAYMENT PERIODS 853these will also become specifically more expensive because of their increasing specific structural mass.;Table 20.3. Calculation of power generation costs of a 100 MW wind park consisting of 50 wind turbines (rotor diameter 82 m, rated power 2MW, tower height 80 m, mean wind velocity 6.50 ms at 80 m height);Investment Costs Exworks price of 50 wind turbines, each 2.0 MW Planning, infrastructure and financing (approx. 30  of ex factory price)  Total investment costs;Annual Costs Maintenance and repairs, insurance, land lease (3.5  of exfactory price of wind turbines, 2.7  of  investment costs) Service of capital (6  interest p.a., 20 years) Annuity 8.72 ;5.50 ms 0.1 m 6.50 ms;When considering the figures of Table 20.3, one should never lose sight of thesignificance of the mean wind speed at the site. Figure 20.4 therefore, shows the rela tionship between power generation costs and the mean annual wind velocity for the example shown in Table 20.3.;Taking into consideration the total wind speed spectrum available in most countries,the power generation costs of a mediumsized or large wind turbine can be assessed as follows At a reasonable site (6.5 ms at 80 m height), power generation costs of 0.07 to 0.09 USkWh can be achieved, if the entire service life of a wind turbine is granted as depreciation period for the capital investment. This value would be of significance if wind turbines were to be used in competition with conventional power stations by the electricity producers. An operator, who must assess the economic feasibility of the investment by
