18.2 TECHNICAL LAYOUT OF WIND PARK INSTALLATIONS 733volumes from decentralised power stations. Nevertheless, the mediumvoltage grid was initially the most important voltage level with regard to the use of wind energy.;The local lowvoltage or urban grids supply households and other small consumerssuch as trade buildings, farms etc. Only relatively small wind turbines with a power of up to approximately 100 kW and in some exceptional cases a little above this value can be connected to the lowvoltage grid. Connecting relatively small wind turbines to the lowvoltage grid, occasionally called house service, is especially simple and inexpen sive.; Distance of the wind turbine from the grid,  Voltage and transmission capacity of the grid,  Power control and electrical equipment of the wind turbine,  Technical requirements of the utility for power stations operated in parallel with thegrid (Chapt. 10.7.2). The choice of grid connecting point is determined not only by the site and the power;grid (Chapt. 10.7.2). The choice of grid connecting point is determined not only by the site and the powerof the wind turbine but also to a considerable extent by the state of the grid and the power system perturbation caused by the wind turbine. The distance to a suitable con necting point at which these perturbations can be handled by the system may increase with their severity.;Before going into detail about these factors, a more precise definition of the positionof the turbine in relation to the public utility is of use (Fig. 18.9). In this context, several terms must be clarified.
