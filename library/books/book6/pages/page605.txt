The peaks are located in very flat sections of the power curves so that even considerable deviations from the optimal speed do not change the energy yield dramatically. In practical designs, therefore, the wind data of a representative site which are typical of a large number of sites considered will be used as a basis. It is worth changing the nomi nal rotor speed only if there are considerable variations in the wind regimes. This would then be carried out simultaneously with an adaptation of the installed generator power.;One fundamental question that keeps recurring is Is it worthwhile, from an energyoutput point of view, to have a variable rotor speed? The range of speed variation must be considerable to permit effective windoriented operation. It should cover the complete partialload range, from cutin to rated wind speed. For common values of the rated power per rotorswept area, this means a speed range from approximately 40 to 100 . Depending on the wind turbine characteristics and the wind regime, the achievable in crease in energy output ranges from 3 to 5  (Figs. 14.38 and 14.39). This may be not high enough to more than compensate for the added costs of a generator system with frequency inverter. However, the advantages of variable speed rotor operation are not restricted to the gain in energy output alone. Reduced dynamic loads on the mechanical components, a reduced aerodynamic noise during partialload operation and a smoother power output may possibly count for more than the modest increase in energy yield. Instead of a continuous speed variation, some smaller wind turbines have two generators which permit speed stepping. Numerous earlier Danish turbines made use of this possi bility (s. Chapt. 9). Two fixed rotor speeds provide almost the same energetic yield as
