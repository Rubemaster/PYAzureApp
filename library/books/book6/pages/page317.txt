On some sites, there is a risk that ice becomes deposited on the rotor blades under cer tain weather conditions (s. Chapt. 18.8.2). For this reason, the manufacturers of rotor blades offer an optional ice warning system which switches the unit off as a preventa tive measure during certain weather conditions.;A much more complicated task is that of providing the rotor blades with a deicingsystem. An electrical resistance heater developed by some rotor blade manufacturers and also being offered already in some cases (Fig. 8.31). In view of the permanent de formation of the blade structure under the bending stress, the mounting system and the material of the heating elements are subject to particularly high demands. In addition, there is the problem that the inbuilt metallic threads are extremely at risk from a light ning strike. In recent years it has also been attempted to largely prevent the blade sur face from icing up by means of a special surface coating. However, a fully satisfactory deicing system is not available at present.;Enercon experimented with a deicing system using heated air from an electric heaterand from generator cooling (Fig. 8.32). The hot air is blown into the blade root. This seems to be a practical solution for the hub and inner blade area.;So far there is, however, no comprehensive experience available regarding deicingsystems, nor is there any for the electrical heating system. But there are only few loca tions where a deicing system seems to be really necessary. In most cases the ice warn ing system is sufficient shutting down the wind turbine. Due to the few days of the year with icing weather conditions, the loss of energy yield is not very important from the economical point of view.
