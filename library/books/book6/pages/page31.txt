Fig. 1.12. Dutch windmill with fantail for automatic yawingother than Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (16461716) who involved himself deeply in the matter. In a paper on the Wind Arts, he provided numerous impulses for the construction of windmills, also proposing new designs. Daniel Bernoulli (17001782) applied his recently formulated basic laws of fluid mechanics to the design of windmill sails. The mathematician Leonhard Euler (17071783) was the first to correctly calculate the twist of the sails.;(Fig. 1.13). The sailcloth frames, which had to be reefed by hand by the miller when the wind was too strong, had been replaced by sails with hinged shutters interconnected by an iron rod, which could be opened and shut easily. Initially, the slats were made of wood, later of sheet metal. Some windmills were even built with selfregulating shutters, the segments of which were connected to the surrounding frame by steel springs. These innovations became established mainly in Great Britain.;For the first time ever, a certain amount of speed and power regulation of thewindmill was possible due to the spring sails. This, in combination with the automatic yawing carried out by the fantail, enabled the Dutch windmill to reach the peak of its technical development and a remarkable degree of perfection. However, the aerodynamic efficiency of the spring sails was not as high as that of good sailcloth sails. This fact became apparent after the physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb had started to carry out systematic aerodynamic experiments with windmill sails in 1821 and when the Danish professor Poul La Cour, in about 1890, carried out comprehensive scientific research in windmill sail aerodynamics and windmill design. Poul La Cour deserves the merit of having comprehensively analysed and described the fundamentals of
