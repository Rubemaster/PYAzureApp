The wind turbulence has an influence on the power curve of a wind turbine. There are two different aspects Firstly the air turbulence increases the power density of the air stream through the rotor. Using 10minute mean values instead of instantaneous values as a basis for representing the power curve leads to an underestimation of the power density in the airflow. The power is a function of the third power of the wind velocity. The contribution of the cubes of the instantaneous wind peaks above the mean value is, therefore, greater than of those below the mean.;However, the measured or specified turbulence intensity does not take into consideration the spatial variation of the turbulence including the lateral and vertical compo nents. Considering the rotor swept area, a large proportion of the turbulence effects is levelled out due to the rotor. And, not lastly, the wind speed measurement serving as reference for the electrical power output is based on 10minute mean values and thus itself contains a component of the turbulence which contributes to the air power density. The point of view of the practical operation of the wind turbine, the influence of tur bulence on the energy yield of the turbine is, as a rule, not severe. In practice, a positive effect of turbulence on the power curve can only be found in the lower wind speed range, if at all. This is contrasted by a negative effect in the area of rated power. The inertia of the blade pitch control causes greater rounding of the characteristic (Fig. 14.19), Figure 14.20 shows an example of the differences in the power curve with different turbulence intensities. This shows at least clearly that con sideration of turbulence is indispensible for a precise measurement of the power curve
