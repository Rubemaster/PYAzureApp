436 CHAPTER 11 CONTROL SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONAL SEQUENCEmanufacturers such as Enercon and Vestas have for some time switched to completely developing their own control systems. The systems, which are matched precisely to the requirements of their use in the wind turbine, are more compact and more cost effective in series production. The basic operation of the actual controllers, or of the corresponding control algorithms used in a wind turbine, have characteristics known from general control technology.;In principle, purely proportional feedback (P controller) is sufficient for the relatively simple control tasks such as, e.g., for yaw control. However, since this character istic tends to allow small final deviations from the setpoint value, the controllers are provided with an integral section in the feedback path (PI controller). These slowly reduce the final deviation to zero. To achieve a faster control intervention, for example for blade pitch control, a differential section is added (PID controller) but a certain delay in the response must then be accepted.;The signals of the various sensors are interrogated by the computer of the controlsystem at the rate of kiloHertz, so that the system is not dependent on the informa tion provided by individual interpolation values which may be wrong or untypical. The signals from several interpolation values to be processed are averaged and weighted in accordance with the least squares algorithm. Advanced data bus systems are an impor tant technology for the data transfer between the decentralised controllers and the main computers of the control system. They become increasingly standardised, so that various components of the control system, delivered by different suppliers, can be integrated in the system (s. Chapt. 11.7).
