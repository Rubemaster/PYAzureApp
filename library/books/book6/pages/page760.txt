18.4 ERECTION ON THE SITE 751by an hydraulic pulling device (Fig. 18.27). If necessary, hydraulic power could be replaced by pure muscle action.;It must be noted, however, that such methods of assembly are not without effect on thedesign of the turbine. From an economic point of view, therefore, they can only be justified if normal hoisting equipment is not available. Nevertheless, the design of wind turbines which can be erected without extensive hoisting equipment is certainly justified for special sites. Apart from the example shown, the most diverse solutions have been proposed for this purpose, including telescoping towers. As wind turbines become more widely used in re mote regions of the Third World, such erecting methods, used only with experimental tur bines at present, may well become popular.;In the Californian wind farms, the feverish construction activities of the years 1982to 1986 were sometimes carried out with unconventional methods. Even transport and erection with a helicopter can be economically justifiable in impassable terrain (Fig. 18.28). The economics in this case were determined by the deadline for the grant of the socalled tax credits. In this early phase of the commercial wind energy utilisation the turbines had to be erected  but not necessarily in operation. One of the reasons why a great deal of the Californian wind farms was definitely not working.
