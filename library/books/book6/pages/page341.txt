In principle, the comparatively small angle of rotation of the rotor blades does not require any complicated bearing arrangement. In some relatively small turbines, occasional at tempts have therefore been made to make do with relatively simple hinge bearings. In larger systems, however, attention must be paid to the fact that the moments of friction of the bearing remain as small as possible so that the pitching forces do not become unneces sarily large. It is for this reason that the rotor blades are generally mounted with conven tional roller bearings in the rotor hub.;The loading of the rotor blades is comparatively unfavourable with respect to rollerbearings. The bearings are exposed to high static loads, even when the rotating move ments are small. Moreover, permanent deformations of the bearing support is more or less unavoidable. Given these preconditions, the criteria of rippling and frictional corrosion must be considered in the design of the roller bearings. By comparison, the normal design parameter determining service life, the specified number of rolling cy cles, only plays a subordinate role in the roller bearings of the rotor blades. In general, that which applies to all bearings in the mechanical drive train also applies to the rotor blade bearings. The roller bearings in wind turbines are subjected to very special condi tions which is why the bearing design and their maintenance require special attention (s. a. Chapt. 9.6.1).;Todays concept of rotor blade bearings is an inplane bearing system where theroller bearings are grouped in one plane over a very short distance. In older types of wind turbine, cylindrical rollers are arranged in planes perpendicular to each other (Fig. 9.18). This type is relatively complex and thus expensive. Doublerow angularcontact cylindrical or crossed roller bearings are simpler.
