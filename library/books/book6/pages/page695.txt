Where the water is very deep, lattice steel structures, socalled jackets, are also suit able. Such foundation structures have been used for years for many other types of off shore constructions and have been quite successful. A jacket structure has a good ratio of stiffness to weight and costs and they are, therefore, a good alternative for wind tur bine foundations under certain conditions (Figs. 17.8 and 17.9).
