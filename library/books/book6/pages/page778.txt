18.6 OPERATION AND MONITORING 769for recognizing indications of probable damage and premature wear phenomena on me chanical components. Damage on roller bearings, gear wheels, shafts and similar components becomes ap parent very early as changes in the typical frequency spectra of the components 6. In the example of Figure 18.44 these frequency spectra are automatically analysed and from these, socalled traffic light spectra which have yellow and red areas and indi cate the state of danger. When the yellow areas are reached, Emails are automatically sent to the service organisations of the manufacturers. The service specialists are able to increase the intensity of monitoring and activate further detailed analyses. If the changes reach the red area, an alarm message is issued and repair measures are initiated.;Fig. 18.44. Frequency spectrum and associated traffic light spectrum from a technical condi tion monitoring system 6 Condition monitoring is considered to be indispensible, especially for wind turbines which are installed offshore. A variety of different systems and procedures have already been developed and are in most cases offered by the manufacturers of the wind turbines. Socalled telecontrol systems which can be used for carrying out certain repairs, for example in the area of electronics, are also being discussed for this field of application. Such systems have already been developed to a relatively high degree for unmanned missions in space travel.
