For the reasons discussed in Chapter 16.3, the selfuse of wind energy is restricted to a few exceptions and, therefore, virtually of no significance in wind energy utilisation. Today, wind turbines are operated almost without exception for the purpose of feeding the generated power into the grid. The legal conditions for feeding into the grid are subject to regulations in almost all European countries. The decisive question is, therefore, what price is offered to the operator of a wind turbine for one kilowatthour of electricity fed in. In some countries, there are legal or semilegal regulations for payment for feedingin power (such as Germany, Denmark, Spain, Greece, and France). In other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, the turbine operator must negotiate the electricity price with the utility or compete with others. Table 20.10 shows the payments made for wind power in some countries of the European Union in recent years.
