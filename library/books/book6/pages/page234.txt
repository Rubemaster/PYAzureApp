6.8 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FEATURES AND STRUCTURAL STRESSES 219for the historical W34 wind turbine of U. Htter in the Fifties (s. Chapt. 2.4). Coupling teetering and blade pitch movements is achieved either by means of a mechanical link age or by suitably tilting the teetering axis with respect to the rotor shaft. This latter method is called 3coupling, a term adopted from helicopter technology.;However, the effect of blade pitch coupling depends to a great extent on the aerodynamic sensitivity of the rotor. For heavy rotors, the effect was considered too weak to justify the mechanical complexity (for example MOD2). But also some smaller tur bines with teetering rotors, for example the earlier American ESI turbines, managed without blade pitch coupling.;The theoretically greatest dynamic compliance of the rotor can be achieved by provid ing the rotor blades with additional leadlag freedom. Helicopter rotors have flapping and leadlag hinges, as is generally known. However, the mechanical complexity of these is enormous. There is the additional hazard of high degrees of instability, so that flapping and leadlag hinges are not found in large wind rotors. An attempt in this direc tion was made by John Brown in 1955 with his 100 kW wind turbine, which was un necessarily applied to a threebladed rotor. The project turned out to be a failure for other reasons, too. It is easier to provide the rotor blades with leadlag freedom by using a variable rotor speed, which can then be considered as a collective leadlag motion of the rotor blades.;Considered all in all, mechanical hinges between rotor and rotor shaft have not beensuccessful in large wind turbines. Apart from other problems, all systems have displayed great wear. Improvements have been achieved today due to progress in control engineer ing. Individual control of the blade pitch angle has a similar effect to loadcompensating
