5.2.2 Power Characteristics of Various Rotor Configurations;In the previous chapter the dependency of the rotor power coefficient on the aerody namic concept of power extraction from the wind has been discussed, especially the difference between drag and aerodynamic lift generating rotors. Figure 5.15 shows the qualitative differences in the power coefficients (the envelope of the family of power curves in the case of adjustablepitch rotors) for rotors of different configurations. The historical wind wheels were dragtype rotors with low tip speed ratio. Their power was generated mainly by the air drag of the surfaces moved by the wind and the aerody namic characteristics of the blades themselves, especially the airfoil characteristics, were of minor importance (s. Chapt. 4.2). The power coefficients only achieved a mod est value of about 0.2 to 0.3, under these circumstances. It was only with fastermoving rotors with rotor blades making use of lift that power coefficients close to 0.5 could be achieved. Rotors with the latest generation of blades achieve maximum rotor power coefficients distinctly in excess of 0.5, i.e. very close to Betzs ideal value. Verticalaxis rotors are in a special position in this regard. Although their rotor blades are also using aerodynamic lift, their maximum power coefficients lag behind those of the horizontal axis rotors (s.a. Chapt. 5.8).;Similar differences can be seen in the torque characteristics (Fig. 5.16). While theslow multibladed rotors have a high torque, the torque is much lower for rotors with low blade solidity and few blades. This is especially true of the starting torque. Fast running twobladed rotors have such a poor starting torque that they can barely start unless the blades are pitched to an optimum pitch angle.
