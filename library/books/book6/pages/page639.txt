The crosssectional area of the tower of even a large wind turbine amounts to only afew square meters. Depending on the type of turbine, the area of its foundation is of the order of about 200 to 400 m. If the installed power of the wind turbine is related to this basic area, a landarea of 240 mMW is required for a 500 kW turbine with a founda tion area of approx. 120 m.;15.17). This value improves even more with increasing wind turbine size. As has been shown by a relevant study, all the other regenerative energy systems have a much higher land requirement. Wind turbines need the same amount of area as conventional power plants if the gross requirement of the power plant including all annexes for fuel storage and other purposes are included 19.;What is more important than the figure for installed power is the amount of energy tobe extracted in relation to the land area. Assuming an annual energy yield of approxi mately 1.4 million kWh for a 500 kW turbine, this yields a value of 11.7 MWhm2 per year. For a regenerative energy system, this value, too, is extraordinarily high. Wind turbines also score well when being compared with a conventional power plant. A 750 MW coalfired power station with 4000 hours operating time has a characteristic value of 15 to 20 MWhm2. Hence, the excessive landuse requirement as frequently claimed is not a valid argument against the extensive use of wind energy.
