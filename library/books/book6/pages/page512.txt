A second load case relates to wind turbine at maximum wind speed. The determiningfactor is here the highest assumed wind speed, the socalled survival wind speed (Chapt. 6.3). However, the technical concept of the wind turbine also plays a certain role. Turbines with stall control do not provide the option of feathering the rotor blades so that comparatively high standstill loads can occur with his design, a fact which is of significance in the dimensioning of the foundation and thus in the costing.;The properties of the soil certainly play a role for the type and the dimensions of thefoundation. Particularly on sites with weak soil i.e. on the shore of the North Sea, the foundation has to be supported by piles, which transfer the loads into deeper more solid groundlayers.;Furthermore the water flow in the ground has to be considered. The ground watercauses considerable bouyancy on the foundation. The foundation needs more mass, so called bouyancyfoundation. The area needed for the foundation of a wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 80 to 100 m and a tower height of 100 m amounts to about 200m. The geometric shape can be circular, octagonal or sometimes crossshaped.;The slab foundations, often called the standard foundation, are circular or rectangular or polygonal footings. The tubularsteel towers are anchored by a foundation section joined to the steel reinforcement of the concrete (Fig. 12.33). The required mass and the dimensions of the slab are determined by the overturning moment of the structure. This is resisted by the weight of the turbine, the tower and the foundation itself.
