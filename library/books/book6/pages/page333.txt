The advantage of welded designs is that they can be produced without large investments in production tools. They are for this reason the preferred solution for oneoff produc tion runs and for small quantities. Experimental turbines and first generation wind tur bines frequently had welded rotor hubs (Fig. 9.11).;But welded hub constructions also have one decisive disadvantage. As in the case ofrotor blades made of steel, the welded seams must be checked particularly carefully and for reasons of safety, the allowable stress values must be set extremely low. As a conse quence, the weight, and the costs for mass production, are high which is why welded rotor hubs are now found only in small, older wind turbines.;Dropforged or precisionforged components have the highest strength parameters. This generally known fact suggests that the rotor hubs in wind turbines should be forged. From the point of view of strength, forged hub bodies are indeed the ideal solution.;During forging the material is compacted, and thus strengthened. Moreover, the forging operation can be carried out such that the crystals are stretched in the direction of stress. In this way, highstrength components are obtained which are capable of with standing the same stress, but which are considerably lighter than welded or cast compo nents.;These advantages, however, are balanced by high cost. Particularly with larger components, production costs become extremely high. It is for this reason that, for example, the teetering hub of the experimental Swedish WTS34 turbine was made from a combination of forged and cast components. For very large series, however, when the
