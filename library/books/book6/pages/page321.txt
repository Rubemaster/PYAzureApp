9.1 FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS OF POWER TRANSMISSION 307transmission operating with a wide speed range and at high efficiency has remained a technological development goal yet to be achieved to this day.;Some attempts in this field do, however, exist. Socalled variablespeed powersplitting transmissions with electric or hydrostatic servomotors are used in special purpose vehicles or in certain areas of motive power technology. Basically, transmissions of this type are also suitable for wind turbines. However, these transmissions are rela tively complex and require a lot of servicing.;A large wind turbine using continuously variable hydrostatic transmission technologywas built in the late seventies in the US (Fig. 9.1). However, the experience gained from about two years of test operation proved to be quite negative. The design implemented there was neither convincing in efficiency nor in reliability, let alone in production cost. The turbine proved to be completely unreliable and was disassembled after only a few hours of operation. However, the defects were not only attributable to the continuously variable transmission the overall concept of the project contributed at least as much.;Fig. 9.1.
