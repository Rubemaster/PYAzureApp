214 CHAPTER 6 LOADS AND STRUCTURAL STRESSESand nonstationary effects, for example in aerodynamics, can be included. Furthermore a great number of components can be modelled in a detailed finiteelement representa tion (multibody simulation). By numerical integration of the equations over the time, subdivided into short time steps, the problems can be dealt with any desired level of accuracy. A great variety of commercial available computer codes are offered for struc tural dynamics. They are used in nearly all fields of technology for dynamically loaded systems. In wind energy technology structural dynamic simulations become more or less mandatory in the certification process.;A critical remark should be allowed about the extensive use of structural dynamicsimulations, regardingless there undisputed importance. The very complex simulation codes are not suited for finding an optimal conceptual design of a system. This task remains to the design engineer or to the design team. Finding an optimal concept in cludes much more aspects, like costs, manufacturing capabilities or operational issues. An optimum concept only can be based on experience and creativity. The first one is as important as the second one.
