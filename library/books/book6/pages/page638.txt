Land is becoming ever more scarce. For example, almost 10  of the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is already covered with asphalt and concrete for streets, industry and housing. This fact forces the land requirements of a technology to be con sidered also from the point of view of its environmental impact. What does the situation look like with regard to wind turbines? The minimum area required for erecting a wind turbine is the area needed for the tower and its foundation. Annexes for measuring and test facilities often found with the large experimental wind turbines no longer exist in todays series produced turbines. The equipment needed for operation and grid connec tion is housed in the tower base in most cases. Central buildings of larger wind farms are hardly significant compared with the number of wind turbines.;Occasionally it is argued that extensive safety zones must be added to the basic arearequired for tower and foundation so that, for example, rotor blades breaking off do not cause any harm. This argumentation must be opposed rigorously. If such standards were also applied to other technologies, wide, deserted safety zones would also have to be provided alongside every road or below the flight corridors of every airport. In these locations, uninvolved persons are exposed to incomparably greater hazards in cases of catastrophic technical failure. Compared to that, the damage caused by a rotor blade breaking off is relatively minimal. In areas where wind energy utilisation has a tradition, a realistic attitude towards the possible dangers presented by wind turbines is natural, as illustrated in Figure 15.16.
