The installation of a fluid coupling between gearbox and generator is a very effective solution for damping undesirable dynamic vibrations and load peaks in the drive train. In the American MOD0A, which was equipped with a synchronous generator, a hy draulic clutch was subsequently built into the highspeed shaft. The load peaks in the drive train, which had initially occurred and which were caused by the strong tower shadow effect, complicated the synchronisation to the grid frequency to an intolerable extent. The fluid coupling acted to damp the vibration response of the synchronous generator and smoothed power output as well as the dynamic load on the drive train (Chapt. 6.6.4). However, the use of a fluid coupling is associated with noticeable power losses.;The combination of synchronous generator with fluid coupling was later adopted bysome other manufacturers. For example, the earlier Westinghouse WWG0600 and the Howden HWP300 with synchronous generators directly coupled to the grid were equipped with hydraulic clutches in the drive train (Fig. 9.56). According to the manufac turers information, the power loss in the Howden HWP300 amounted to approximately 2 to 3  at full load. More recent development have been made by some other manufactur ers, for example by GE for some of their wind turbines. Obviously the use of a synchro nous generator is considered as advantageous, particularly with respect to the favourable electric properties in the parallel grid operation.
