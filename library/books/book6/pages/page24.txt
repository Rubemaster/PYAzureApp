1.2 EUROPEAN WINDMILLS 7the rope of which was looped around posts arranged concentrically around the mill. Post windmills were made almost completely from wood and were used exclusively for milling grain. Their external shapes varied greatly according to regional preferences.;In the early 15th century, efforts were made to use post windmills for driving scoop wheels for pumping water. However, the rotatable millhouse was unsuitable for this purpose. In Holland, this situation inspired the development of the post windmill into the socalled hollow post mill or Wipmolen (Fig. 1.6). In this type of mill, a fixed, usually pyramidshaped base was introduced which housed the scoop wheel drive. The small rotatable millhouse now contained only the windwheel bearing, with cog wheel and wallower. A hollow post, through which the extended vertical wallower shaft was passed, formed the connection between millhouse and fixed base. Due to this hollow post, this type of mill was also sometimes called Kokermolen. In Holland, these mills were used mainly for draining, later also for milling grain and sawing wood.
