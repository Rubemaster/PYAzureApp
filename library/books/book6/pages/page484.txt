One important criterion which plays a role at least for thinwalled tubularsteel towers with a low natural bending frequency below the 1 P excitation is the resistance to local buckling of the tube wall. As a result of the increasing weight optimisation in modern tubularsteel towers, the buckling strength frequently becomes the determining dimen sioning factor for the required wall thicknesses.;The stability problem of folding occurs in the case of slender components which are subjected to pressure loading. This situation only occurs in lattice towers so that the appropriate certificate must be provided here for the heavily pressureloaded lattice rods.;The example of the MOD2 clearly illustrates in a real case the consequences of these load cases with respect to the required tower wall thickness (Fig. 12.7). Despite the soft tower design, the necessary wall thickness is determined by the stiffness require ment, a result which is typical of almost all comparable modern tower concepts. This becomes even more pronounced when the tower height in relation to the rotor diameter is greater than was the case in the MOD2. Apart from a few exceptions, the important criterion for dimensioning the tower is, therefore, the stiffness requirement.
