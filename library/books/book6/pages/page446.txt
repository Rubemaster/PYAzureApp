Taking into account the deficiency in the evaluation of the measured values, measuring the wind speed on the nacelle roof supplies sufficiently accurate results for the operational control of the turbine and, with some reservations, also for checking the power characteristic. For this purpose the free stream wind speed and the wind speed on the nacelle will simultaneously be measured and plotted versus each other. The ratio of the free stream wind speed to the nacelle wind speed can be used for correcting the power curve, if it is measured by the operational wind speed measuring system.;The wind measuring system basically consists of two main components, the sensorand the data processing system. Sensors for the combined measurement of wind speed and direction are available in numerous forms. As a rule, wind speed is recorded by a cup anemometer (Fig. 11.3). Wind direction is determined with the aid of a small wind vane. In most cases, the speed of the cups and the position of the wind vane are scanned optoelectronically.;The measured data are usually processed electronically, especially if the scanningprocess is also carried out electronically. The signal processing depends on the require ments of the sequence controller. Above all, a suitable determination of mean values is important, as they are used as the switching signal for the yawing system and for cut tingin the turbine. The mean values must be determined in such a way that the signals for cuttingin the rotor and for yawing are input with the correct delay in order to avoid too much cuttingin and out or yawing. Programmable instruments which are easily adaptable to the characteristics of the turbine and to the peculiarities of the local wind conditions, are very helpful for this purpose.
