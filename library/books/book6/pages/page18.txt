The utilisation of wind energy is not a new technology but draws on the rediscovery of a long tradition of wind power technology. It is no longer possible now to tell from the remainders of historical wind power plants just how important a role wind power played in the past. The triumphal spread of the cheap coal and oil fuels and of easy energy distribution in the form of electricity was so complete that the losers, windmills and windwheels, could only survive in economic niches of little importance. Today, while energy production based on the burning of coal and oil or on the splitting of the uranium atom is meeting with increasing resistance, regardless of the various reasons, the reemergence of wind power is an almost inevitable consequence. The objection could be raised that nostalgia is not a useful tool for solving future energy problems. Today, the argument is not about milling grain or pumping water, but about the energy requirements of modern industrial societies. Looking back, however, it becomes obvious that wind energy technology at the beginning of the 20th century had by no means lost out to the energy form of electricity, to which currently no alternative concept exists, nor that was it even unsuitable for the purpose. Measured against the modest means of some pioneers, the successes they achieved in generating electricity by means of wind power were remarkable. In some cases the generation of electricity by means of the power captured from the wind had even passed beyond the stage of experimentation. When discussing modern wind turbines, recalling the historical roots of wind power technology is, therefore, more than just passing time. The technical solutions and economic conditions which led to the successes and failures of the past will still provide hints for the development of today and the future. Thus, this book starts out with a look at the past.
