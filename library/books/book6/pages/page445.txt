The question arises, therefore, as to what extent the measured values are influenced by the rotor flow. Two contrary influences must be considered. According to Betzs the ory, the free stream velocity is reduced to barely two thirds of the undisturbed value in the rotor plane in an ideal turbine. But this only applies to the ideal power coefficient of 0.593. A real wind turbine rotor with a distinctly lower power coefficient also produces less retardation to the air flow.;It can be assumed that a fast modern rotor with a maximum power coefficient ofapprox. 0.45 retards the wind speed in the rotor plane by approximately 25  in nominal operation. At a rated wind speed of approximately 12 ms, wind speed measurements on the nacelle roof behind the rotor will show a discrepancy of 2 to 3 ms.;On the other hand, the flow past the nacelle leads to an accelerated air flow in itsimmediate vicinity, compared with which the retardation of the flow due to the rotor in the root area of the rotor blades is scarcely noticeable. The wind measuring system on the roof of the nacelle will, therefore, measure, as a rule, a wind speed which is in creased by 1 to 1.5 ms.;If the incident flow is at an angle for example caused by an inaccurate yaw position,the onesided shading effect of the nacelle can also distort the wind speed and wind direction measurement. It is for this reason, but also for reasons of redundancy, that two anemometers are sometimes mounted on large turbines.
