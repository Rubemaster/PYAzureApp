Apart from the considerable investment costs  even with existing storage capacities the disadvantage of this method is its low efficiency. Since the heat produced in compress ing the air is lost, the efficiency is only within a range of 40 to 50 . More recent concepts use socalled adiabatic storage in which the heat produced is stored in an additional heat reservoir and is supplied again to the drive turbines when needed. The efficiency is thus increased to up to 70  and the use of fuel (natural gas) is reduced to a small remainder or even eliminated altogether. However, adiabatic compressedair energy storage power stations are only at the very beginning of their development and their implementation still requires extensive research and development work. The technology is promoted by the EU in a European Research project and its industrial application is not expected before 2015.;As long as there is no suitable storage device a second power supply system is neces sary to supply the consumer with firm power. A conventional generator set may be used in addition to the wind turbine. An autonomous supply system of this type, consisting of a wind turbine, storage battery with frequency converter, load management and an addi tional emergency generating set, represents a considerable technical investment (Fig. 16.4). Such a complex and expensive system is economically justified only when the fuel costs for a supply provided exclusively by a diesel generator are extremely high.;Apart from a Diesel generator set also other energy sources may be applied. For example a power generating system which uses biomass as fuel in combination with a wind turbine an autonomous power supply system is established capable of delivering firm power provided the biomass is continuously available.
