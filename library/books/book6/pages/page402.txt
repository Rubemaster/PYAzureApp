Fig. 10.4. Torque vs. load angle of a synchronous machine 3;Next to efficiency, generator mass is of importance to the wind turbine designer, particularly in horizontalaxis wind turbines, where the generator is located at the tower head. The generator mass is influenced considerably by the speed level at a given rated power (Fig. 10.6). The faster the generator rotates, the lighter and, as a rule, more cost efficient it becomes. With respect to their application in a wind turbine, this does not,
