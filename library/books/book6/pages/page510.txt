rarely found there. Enercon, for example, uses a hybrid construction of a prestressed concrete tower, consisting of prefabricated elements, together with a tubular steel sec tion of about 2025  of the constructional height for their towers with more than 100 m height.;Figure 12.30 shows the tendency how the tower mass increases with the height fortubular steel towers and lattice tower. The increase of costs for the steel constructions depend very much of the raw materials costs. The estimate in Figure 12.31 is based on the steel price of 2009.;So that the optimum tower height can be determined from the point of view of econom ics, the increase in costs of the higher tower must be compensated for by an increased energy yield. Certainly the increase of wind speed with height depends on the wind characteristics on the site. The vertical wind profile at an offshore site demands a lower optimal height of the tower compared to an inland site.
