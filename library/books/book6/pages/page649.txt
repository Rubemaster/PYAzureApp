640 CHAPTER 16 COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF WIND TURBINEScontinuously variable speed and torque conversion system  electrical or mechanical  is required for transferring the mechanical energy into the flywheel 2. Coupling the wind rotor to the storage flywheel via a continuously variable transmission is technically feasible, but disproportionately complex and also subject to losses. The situation is different when a flywheel is used as shortterm storage for smoothing the power output of a wind turbine, a purpose to which it is much better suited. This idea was imple mented as early as 1950 in a small wind turbine in the former Soviet Union 3.;Recently, Enercon has developed a flywheel storage system which is offered for standalone applications and for operation in small grids (Fig. 16.1). The flywheel has a mass of 2.5 t and is connected to an asynchronous motorgenerator 4.;The second possibility for energy storage is offered by the electrical energy generated. The capacity of storing electrical energy in conventional batteries is very limited. The storage capacities of even advanced batteries, for example nickelcadmium or sil verzincbased batteries, are not enough to meet the electrical demand of some ten or even hundred kilowatts over a period of days. The economical use of batteries is there fore restricted to that as shortterm buffer storage batteries and is limited to smallscale power demands. However in connection with the introduction of electric driven cars it can be expected that the battery technology will make progress.
