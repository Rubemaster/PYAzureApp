132 CHAPTER 5 ROTOR AERODYNAMICSmaximum lift coefficient. The separation point of the flow is shifted towards smaller angles of attack, so that the aerodynamic stall begins already at low wind speeds, with the immediate consequence of considerable losses in performance. This effect occurs especially in summer when it hasnt rained for weeks and the numerous insects have soiled the particularly sensitive front edge of the airfoil (s. Chapt. 14.3.4).;5.4.4 Influence on the Power Coefficient of the Rotor;Initially, the influence of the airfoil type on the rotor power coefficient appears to be comparatively small, as long as the airfoils are the usual standard airfoils from aviation and the airfoil surface is smooth (Fig. 5.43). Nevertheless, these differences should not be underestimated. Selecting a highperformance airfoil does not add to the cost, and the aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor is directly proportional to the energy yield and thus ultimately to the economy of the turbine. Theory, and even more so the practical experi ence of recent years, have shown that the traditional aircraft airfoils are not necessarily optimally suited for wind turbines. Some manufacturers use modified NACA airfoils whilst others develop completely new airfoils in accordance with their own conceptions (s. Chapt. 5.4.2). The success of these efforts is documented by some new rotor blades, for example by Enercon. The extraordinarily high turbine power coefficients achieved with these rotor blades are not only due to the optimized airflow in the blade root section but also by using a new de veloped airfoil in the outer section of the blades (s. Chapt. 14.1.4). Aerodynamically
