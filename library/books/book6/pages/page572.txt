The supplier of the wind turbine must provide the purchaser with a guarantee for thepower curve. The curve is generally specified both as a graph and in tabular form. Like with any technical property, a certain tolerance is unavoidable, especially if it is the product of complex interrelationships. A deviation of the curve in the lower wind speed range has different effects on the energy yield, and thus on the economic viability, than a deviation at rated wind speed. Whereas power deficits in the partialload range point to technical deficits in the rotor power coefficients or the other mechanical and electri cal efficiencies involved, a reduced power in the fullload range can be cancelled out by a different adjustment of the power control if this is a turbine with blade pitch control.;Considering these problems, it does not make sense to relate the condition underwhich the guarantee is given, to maintaining the geometric shape of the power curve. Instead, it is the calculated energy yield achieved with a given power curve which is guaranteed by the wind turbine manufacturer. However, this presupposes that manufac turer and purchaser agree on the basis for the mathematical comparison. It is necessary to agree on what wind speed distribution is to be used as a basis for the comparison. The IEC standard recommends the use of a Rayleigh distribution with mean wind speeds in a range from 4 to 11 ms for this purpose. In most cases, the claim for damages in the event of non correspondence with the power curve is agreed at the monetary value of the deficit in energy yield over a specified period.;The definition of the power curve is less precise for wind turbines with fixed bladerotors (Fig. 14.11). This can be caused by errors in the twist of the rotor blades or inac curate pitch angles. Stall, and with it power limiting, often occurs later than expected and the maximum power exceeds the specified rating at higher wind velocities and, on
