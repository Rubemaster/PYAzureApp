One alternative to the crossbolt connection is a blade connection with bondedin alu minium flanges first developed by Vestas. The rotor blades of the larger Vestas turbines have extremely light blade flanges made of highstrength aluminium, which are bonded into the blade root structure (Figs. 8.24 and 8.25). In the rotor blades of the Vestas V 39, with a rotor diameter of 39 m, the flange weighs less than 50 kg. The total weight of the rotor blade is approximately 1100 kg.;A further variant is the blade connection developed by LM, which has bondedin metallic sleeves into which the fastening bolts are screwed. Similar to the bondedin flanges, the surface of the sleeves shaped in such a way that a certain formfitting con nection is produced (Fig.8.26).
