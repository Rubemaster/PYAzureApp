For the benefit of those readers unfamiliar with aerodynamics, the difference between the aerodynamic angle of attack  and the blade pitch angle is as follows the angle of attack is an aerodynamic parameter and the blade pitch angle is a geometric parameter. The two angles are often confused, making it more difficult to understand the aerodynamic relationships.;Linking the relationships of fluid mechanics for the momentum of the axial flow andof the tangential flow components of the rotating wake with the formulations for the aerodynamic forces at the blade element allows the flow conditions at the blade element to be determined so that the local aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients can be read off from the polar airfoil curves (s. Chapt. 5.3.4).;The calculation of the balance of forces includes not only the pure airfoil drag butalso other drag components which derive from the spatial flow around the rotor blade. In particular, the flow around the blade tip, a result of the pressure difference between the top and the underside of the blade, produces the socalled free tip vortices. The resultant drag is called induced drag, a function of the local lift coefficient and the aspect ratio (slenderness) of the blades. The higher the aspect ratio, i.e. the more slen der the blades, the lower the induced drag. These blade tip losses are introduced as addi tional drag components, as are the hub losses which are the result of vortices in the wake of the flow around the hub. They are derived from a complex vortex model of the rotor flow (s. Chapt. 5.1.2). Several semiempirical approaches for these vortex losses have been described in the literature 4.
