The chordwise movement of the rotor blades, i.e. the movement of the blades in the direc tion of the airfoil chord and thus, in a normal operating position, in the plane of rotor rota tion, is not very damped aerodynamically, in contrast to the flapwise movement. In the plane of rotor rotation, the periodically alternating bending moment from the natural weight of the blades comes into action. In addition, the chordwise movement of the rotor blades is associated with the dynamics of the drive train (s. Chapt. 7.3). To these must be added also irregular and alternating forces arising during flow separation when the rotor is operated in the stall region.;The lastmentioned effect, in particular can cause a chordwise bending vibration ofthe rotor blades. This phenomenon was observed especially in large stallcontrolled rotors when they are operated at high wind velocities, i.e. within stalling range. The rotor blade manufacturers have attempted to suppress these vibrations by means of various measures, for example by changing the structural damping which, however, is only very little, in any case, or by means of aerodynamic aids such as stall strips (s.a. Chapt. 5.3.4).;One large blade manufacturer (LM) has provided special hydraulic dampers in theblade tips of some blades in order to suppress the chordwise vibrations (Fig. 7.7). In the meantime, chordwise vibrations of the rotor blades have become a rather rare phenome non since large stallcontrolled rotors are no longer being built and the problem is solved in this way. But on the other hand stall can also occur at pitch controlled rotors. At least under certain operational conditions there is the possibility that flutter vibra tions can cause problems.
