 transient flow processes with rapid changes in the angle of attack, which are manifestwith regard to the maximum lift coefficients and the flow separation at a higher angle of attack, are not detected with the steadystate blade element theory (s.a. Chapt. 5.3.4).;To obtain an insight into these processes, more complex physicalmathematical models must be used in rotor aerodynamics. In principle, suitable methods are available in avia tion aerodynamics but these must be adapted to the specific characteristics of the wind rotor. Inter alia, the significance of these methods also lies in the fact that some aerody namic effects, especially unsteady flow effects, can only be measured with difficulty, leaving only theoretical analysis as a last resort in these cases. In the two chapters which follow two methods are outlined. The first one of which is a traditional method of the wing theory, whilst numeric flow simulation has only become possible in more recent times by applying modern EDP processes.;5.1.2 Vortex Model of Rotor Flow;In wing aerodynamics, a flow model known as vortex model or singularity method was developed in the nineteen thirties. The flow around an aerodynamic airfoil (airfoil the ory) and the threedimensional flow around a finite wing (wing theory), is here dupli cated by a system of vortices and socalled sources and sinks (singularities in terms of flow). The singularities can be mathematically determined and are superimposed on the main flow.;The lift, generated by socalled bound vortices which replace the wing, and the induceddrag caused by the lift, which manifests itself in the free tip vortices, can be calculated using this flow model. The airfoil geometry and the shape of the wing can be simulated by using a more complex allocation of vortices than that shown in Figure 5.7. This model is applied to propellers and aircraft wings and can also be adapted to wind rotors (Fig. 5.8).
