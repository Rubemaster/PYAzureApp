For Europe, very detailed wind data, contained in the European Wind Atlas, have been available for more than twenty years. The European Wind Atlas has been developed by the Danish Research Centre of Ris with support by the European Commission. It is based on the evaluation of the data from more than 200 measuring stations and a spe cially developed mathematical method by means of which the regional wind climate is determined in a particular region. From the regional wind data, local peculiarities (wind obstacles like buildings, etc., surface roughness and orology) are removed and then the data are specified as wind conditions prevailing in the region. From these regionally valid wind data, the local wind data at a particular site can be determined (see Chapt. 13.5.2).
