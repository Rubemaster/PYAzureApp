Fig. 13.1. Global wind flows 1stratification. It occurs at cold nights when the ground surface is cold. In this situation, the movement of the air is dominated by friction with the earths surface and the in crease in mean wind speed with height is large. In a neutral atmosphere, adiabatic cooling of the air as it rises is such that it remains in thermal equilibrium with its sur roundings. This is often the case with strong winds. For wind energy utilisation, neutral stability is the most important situation to consider at least when calculating the turbu lent wind loads on the turbine, but, as mentioned before, unstable atmospheric situations can influence the vertical wind shear exponent (s. Chapt. 13.5.3).;Only about 2  of the solar energy of the 1.5 x 1018 kWh captured annually by theearths atmosphere is converted into energy of motion of the air envelope. Nevertheless, this results in a calculated power of the wind of about 4 x 1012 kWh. This is one hun dred times more than all of the power station output installed on this globe. Of course, such numerical values provide virtually no information about the potential that can be commercially utilised, but nevertheless it is worthwhile to be mentioned. For the pur poses of wind energy use and wind turbine design, the wind vector is considered to be composed of a steady wind plus fluctuations about the steady wind. Whereas for design ing wind turbines, the steady wind and the wind fluctuations have to be considered, the power and energy obtained from wind can be based only on the steady wind speed.
