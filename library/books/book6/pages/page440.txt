The comparison is based on a rated power of approximately 1500 kW. The numericalvalues should remain valid within a range of from approximately 500 kW to several megawatts. However, they cannot be applied to low outputs of less than 100 kW.;The above cost comparison relates to the complete electrotechnical equipment of awind turbine on the basis of the selected generator system. As a result, the cost differ ences of the generator systems are greatly equalized which is exactly what this compari son is intended to show.;The assessment of the electrical efficiency requires a differentiated approach. It is oflittle use to compare the efficiencies of the different electric generators only by taking data merely from the catalogue. The actual differences will only become apparent in the context of the electrical system, on the basis of the selected type of generator, but also taking into consideration an inverter, if necessary for the connection to the grid.;The efficiency of the transformer, approx. 98 to 99 , has been excluded. The fig;The efficiency of the transformer, approx. 98 to 99 , has been excluded. The figures for reactive power compensation and harmonic frequency filtering have to be con sidered. If they are required, these two devices will degrade the total efficiency. The following losses of efficiency can be assumed as guide values; static reactive power compensation 0.8  1.0 ,  harmonics filter approx. 0.5 . The speed range of the generator system has a considerable influence on the electri; static reactive power compensation 0.8  1.0 ,  harmonics filter approx. 0.5 . The speed range of the generator system has a considerable influence on the electrical efficiency and on the cost. In comparison, an economic speed range, adapted to the individual concept, has been assumed. Regardless of the efficiency and cost, a wider speed range can be selected.
