582 CHAPTER 14 POWER OUTPUT AND ENERGY YIELDefficiencies of the mechanicalelectrical energy conversion will differ only slightly. Therefore, a standard power coefficient can be assumed for the turbine.;  air density (1.225 kgm3 at MSL) cPR  rotor power coefficient at rated power (approx. 0.45 for threebladed rotors)  Figure 14.28 shows that, the relationship between the rated wind speed and the ratio of rated power to rotorswept area can be calculated quite well using this approximation. This formula can also be used to answer the question of how much the rated wind speed increases when the installed generator power is raised.;The accuracy of the determination of the rated wind speed, and of the approximate determination of the energy yield, is not the same for stallcontrolled turbines as for pitch controlled turbines. At higher wind speeds, there is not necessarily a relationship between rated generator power and actually absorbed rotor power in stallcontrolled turbines. In addition, many of these rotors are operated at a lower speed than that which produces
