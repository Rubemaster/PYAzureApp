In the area remote from the coast, i.e. in the regions in which most of the offshore;In the area remote from the coast, i.e. in the regions in which most of the offshoreprojects are planned in the German North Sea, the situation is different. The distances from land are up to 100 km and the depth of water of the North Sea is about 3040 m. This must be compared with a higher wind velocity which can be expected to be up to 10 ms at a height of 100 m above the open sea. The offshore projects planned in these regions provide for the use of wind turbines of the 5MW class almost without exception. As mentioned in Chapter 19.5, specific investment costs of over 40004500 USkW must be expected under these circumstances from todays point of view (s. Table 19.26).;In addition, it will have to be assumed that under the given circumstances, the technical availability will be lower and especially that the operating costs per kilowatt hour will be distinctly higher. Table 20.6 shows examples of the range in which the power generation costs can be expected. Considering the risks involved, a commercial operator will have to generate revenues of at least 17 centskWh.;Table 20.6. Assessment of power generation costs of a 300 MW offshore wind park in the North Sea (60 wind turbines of 5 MW each, distance from the coast 100 km, water depth 40 m);Investment Costs 50 wind turbines, ex.factory price Project development, techn. infrastructure, financing Total project costs;Annual Costs Maintenance and repairs, insurance, land lease (11.8  of exfactory price, 5.0  of investment costs) Service of capital (6  interest, 20 years) Annuity 8.72 ;The longterm nature of the investments constitutes a strong argument for the largeoffshore wind parks on the open sea. The investments are in the range of billions and must therefore also be conceived for a service life of at least 40 to 60 years like large conventional power stations. Within this period, the costs of power generation from
