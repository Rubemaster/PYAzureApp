Strictly speaking, the vibrational behaviour of a system with several degrees of freedom can only be treated as a total system. This is true, above all, when the dynamic coupling of the excited degrees of freedom is so strong, that complex vibrational coupling modes are produced the natural frequencies of which deviate distinctly from the separate natu ral frequencies of the components involved. This is basically the situation found in wind turbines. In addition, aerodynamics, gravitational forces, structural and aerodynamic damping and, not least, control characteristics must also be included in the calculation.;Before beginning with a mathematical simulation of such an overall system, it ishelpful to find out as much as possible about the basic vibrational character of the tur bine or of its design so that the critical vibration modes can be recognised. In most cases, isolated mathematical treatment of the components or of specific subsystems of the turbine is feasible. For this purpose, the first and some higher natural frequencies and the vibration modes of the most important components are isolated and then calcu lated for a standstill condition.;The natural frequencies of the subsystem tower with tower head can always be calculated with sufficient accuracy when it is assumed that the rotor is at standstill. The influence of the rotating rotor is small. This only applies to a limited extent to the rotor blades. When rotating, the rotor blades behave differently compared to the standstill condition. The centrifugal forces exert a stiffening influence. Precise determination of the natural rotor blade frequencies therefore requires a mathematical simulation of the rotating rotor, taking into consideration the degrees of freedom and the stiffness of the
