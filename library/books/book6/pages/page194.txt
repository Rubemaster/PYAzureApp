The rotor of a horizontalaxis wind turbine necessarily rotates in close proximity to the tower. The clearance between the rotor rotational plane and the tower is generally kept as small as possible in order to limit the length of the nacelle. A nacelle which protrudes very far causes the rotor forces to act with great leverage with respect to the tower axis. In any case, however, the distance between rotor and tower is so small that the aerody namic flow around the tower influences the rotor.;The influence of the aerodynamic flow around the tower on the rotor is at a minimumwhen the rotor is mounted in the traditional position upwind of the tower. The upwind rotor is affected merely by a retardation of the flow in front of the tower, the socalled bow wave or tower dam effect. This tower dam effect was still a considerable factor with the oldstyle windmills and their mill houses, but with todays slender towers it is only slight. Its effect is still perceptible, but the practical effects on rotor loading are slight as long as a minimum clearance between rotor blade and tower of approximately one tower diameter is maintained (Fig. 6.9). However, the tower dam is a possible haz ard with respect to the excitation of tower vibration if the rotor speed remains within the range of the natural bending frequency of the tower for any length of time (Chapt. 11.4).;A completely different problem arises when the rotor is mounted on the downwindside of the tower. This type of design used to be considered to be advantageous in connec tion with the slender towers in the large firstgeneration wind turbines.
