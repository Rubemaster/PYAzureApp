The blade pitch angle remains at these positions and the power is controlled by flowseparation at the rotor blades, the stall. There is no closedloop control for the power output but nevertheless the term control is used in this case like for all stall controlled rotors. In practice, an active stall control system leads to relatively complex structures as can be seen clearly in the diagram (Fig. 11.18).; A further control loop can be used for adjusting the blade pitch angle with a higherrate of adjustment as a direct response to the 30second mean if this is required. In this control loop, the influence of the air density and of the rotor blade soiling (mainly in summer) is input directly.; A third, fast control loop is provided for an emergency stop of the turbine. Theblade pitch angle is adjusted in the direction of the stop position at a rate of 3 de greessecond on the basis of an o.5second mean value of the power if this exceeds the value of 1.27times the rated power.;Lastly, the abovementioned input parameters are taken into consideration in all three control loops. This control structure obviously departs from the original simplicity of the stall principle, at least in the example presented here. However, the advocates of this principle point to some advantages such as that, in particular, the rotor blade pitch angle is kept close to the stall position over the entire wind speed range so that only very small pitch angle changes are necessary (Fig. 11.19). Even aerodynamic braking only requires an adjustment by approx. 20 degrees (s. Chapt. 5.3.3).
