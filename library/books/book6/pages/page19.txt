2 CHAPTER 1 WINDMILLS AND WINDWHEELSnear Alexandria, with a supposed age of 3000 years 1. There is no convincing proof, however, that the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Greeks or Romans really knew windmills. The first reliable information about the existence of windmills from historical sources originates from the year 644 A.D. 2. It tells of windmills from the PersianAfghan border region of Seistan. A later description, including a sketch, dates back to the year 945 and depicts a windmill with a vertical axis of rotation. It was obviously used for milling grain. Similar, extremely primitive windmills have survived in Afghanistan up to the present time (Fig. 1.1). Some centuries later, the first news arrived in Europe that the Chinese were also using wind wheels for draining rice fields. Whether the Chinese knew windmills even before the Persians and whether the European mills might have been only an offshoot of the Chinese invention, can no longer be determined with certainty today. It is remarkable, however, that the Chinese windwheels, too, were simple structures made of bamboo sticks and fabric sails and that they had a vertical axis of rotation (Fig. 1.2). The windmill with a horizontal axis of rotation, which is the traditional windmill, was probably invented in Europe independently of the verticalaxis windwheels of the Orient. The first verifiable information has its origin in the year 1180 in the Duchy of Normandy. According to this source, a socalled post or trestle mill is supposed to have stood there.;Fig. 1.1.
