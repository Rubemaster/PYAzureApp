One of the first examples of this concept is the drive train of the Multibrid wind turbine. The first prototype of which was built in 2005. The compact generator, together with a singlestage gearbox, is accommodated completely encapsulated in a common housing together with the permanentfield generator (Fig. 9.9). The rotor bearing is integrated in the gearbox.;The complete encapsulation of the components provides for the use of this turbineespecially in offshore applications. In addition, it was possible to achieve a particularly advantageous tower head weight in a very small space due to the extensive integration of the drive train components (s.a. Chapt. 19.1.3). On the other hand, of course, the possibilities for repair without dismantling the tower head are very limited 4.;A similar drive train concept, but in a more advanced design, has been realised in avery recent GermanChinese 3 MW wind turbine (Fig. 9.10). It has a twoblade rotor with a Super Compact Drivetrain (SCD) which has been designed by the German Aerodyn engineering company, the same company which was responsible for the design of the Multibrid wind turbine. The twostage gearbox incorporates a socalled flex pin mounting of the planetary gears. It is distinguished by a very high power density and therefore by very small outer dimensions. The rotor bearing is part of the gearbox and is designed as an inplane bearing (s. Chapt. 9.6.5). The permanent magnet generator is directly attached to the gearbox. The complete assembly of the drivetrain including rotor hub, bearings, gearbox and generator weights about 40 tons.
