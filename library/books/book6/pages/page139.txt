The NACA airfoil series and its nomenclature have undergone a multitude of changes and are constantly being supplemented. Diagrams 5.36, 5.37 and 5.38 show the polar diagrams of three typical airfoils used for wind turbines today. Airfoils of NACA series 44 and 230 are used with approximately 15  thicknesstochord ratio in the outboard section of the rotor blade. They differ slightly in their performance. The 44 series has a slightly lower lifttodrag ratio, but is less sensitive to surface roughness. The 230 series is a more recent airfoil family with a somewhat higher lifttodrag ratio but it is also more sensitive to surface roughness. In addition, the performance decreases greatly with increasing airfoil thickness. Among the traditional aircraft airfoils, the NACA 662XX series has been found to be the one best suited for wind rotors (Fig. 5.39). Its sensitivity to roughness, in particular, is much less in this airfoil family.
