It evolves from negative values at the beginning of the operating pe riod to positive values at the end of the economic operating period. An investment is economic when the NPV added together over the period of investment, is positive. A negative value indicates an uneconomic investment.;Besides the net present value, which provides a criterion for the investments economics, the repayment (amortisation) period is an important further criterion. Formally, this is the period where the difference between costs and earnings is equal to the initial investment. This also means that the repayment period occurs at the time at which the net present value becomes equal to zero. This occurs in year ten in the example consid ered.;Utilities often calculate for their investment projects (power stations) the average costof power generation calculated over the lifetime of the investment and compare this with an alternative in order to find out which is the economically more advantageous project. Naturally, both investments must be calculated by using the same method and under no circumstances must the actual power generation costs be compared with those calculated by the discounted cashflow analysis method. The average power generation costs according to the presentvalue method can be obtained by the formula
