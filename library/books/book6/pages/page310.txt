The simplest solution from a design point of view, and one which saves weight, is to bond the connecting bolts straight into the rotor blade root structure, without further formfitting elements like the cross bolt (s. Chapt. 8.4.2, Fig., 8.19). However, this type of construction is considered to be risky. It may be possible to improve this design in future developments so that it, too, can be used in mass production.;Discussing different rotor blade designs inevitably leads to an attempt to compare one with the other in order to find the best. First of all, as is always the case in engineer ing, there is no single best rotor blade design. Various aspects speaking for or against a certain design must be taken into consideration. Available experience, development costs and development risks, available production machinery as well as the overall con cept of the wind turbine all provide different priorities on which the selection of the blade design must be based. On the other hand, more than 20 years of intensive devel opment work and practical experience have shown that some types of construction are not suitable and this has resulted in a convergence in the design of the rotor blades.;There is one parameter, however, which can be rated as an objective criterion andthat is the blade weight. The weight of the rotor blades is a decisive factor in the overall towerhead weight of a wind turbine. Moreover, the mass of the rotor blades is, of course, a factor not to be underestimated in connection with the manufacturing costs, at least when large quantities of rotors are to be produced.
