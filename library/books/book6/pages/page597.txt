 Large turbine 77 m rotor diameter, 1500 kW rated power, rotor hub height 80 m, power per rotorswept area 322 Wm2, annual energy yield 5 million kWh, capacity factor  0.38, usage time  3333 hours.;A comparison of the capacity factors and usage times of different wind turbines isonly possible when the values of the ratio of rated power per rotorswept area are ap proximately equal. Otherwise, the rated power must be converted to the same ratio per rotorswept area. However, this method only makes sense in wind turbines of approxi mately the same size.
