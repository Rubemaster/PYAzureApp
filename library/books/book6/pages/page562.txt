The calculation of the energy yield is based on the wind speed data, the rotor powercoefficients at different rotational speeds and needs the efficiencies of the energy con version system in the wind turbine. In the calculation procedure a combined mechani calelectrical efficiency will be used. It includes the losses in the rotor bearings, in the gearbox, and the electrical losses in the generator and inverter (see Chapt. 14.1.3).;These power curves, which in each case apply to one rotor speed, are used for calculating the energy yield with the given wind speed distribution. The energy yield in a cer tain time interval is equal to the power output at a certain wind speed, multiplied by the time interval during which this wind speed is to be expected within the given period of time, usually one year. For this purpose, the relative frequency distribution or cumulative frequency distribution of wind speed is used. This is subdivided into wind speed classes  and the frequency value  is read off the distribution function (Chapt. 14.3).
