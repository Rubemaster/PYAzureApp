Through almost all regions of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea close to the coast, ship ping routes pass. Attention must be paid not only to civil waterborne traffic the military also use certain regions for exercises or communications facilities. Civil aviation is less problematic in this context, but requirements possibly for height restriction and always for visual and electronic warning signals must be heeded.;This area is by far the most extensive one and without contest also the most important one. The key words under which the ecological impacts are discussed are   Birds bird migration, collisions with birds, breeding areas, food sources for birds,etc.;A further problem is that many ecological aspects, which are raised in the discussions, have the nature of suppositions or must first be seen in their correct dimension. The assumption that the electrical fields which may emanate from the underwater cables of the wind turbines could have an adverse effect on the wellbeing of the loveable small creatures in the sea bottom can be considered, on the one hand, as a stimulus for inter esting research work never performed and one can wait for the results  which, unfortu nately, will only be forthcoming in longtime trials  or one is forced to weigh up the economical pros and cons. All the same, the future offshore utilisation of wind energy will provide the probably most significant contribution for an ecologically effective energy supply for the foreseeable future.;When a new field of utilization appears, it must be delimited against existing economic interests. Particular cases are   Obstruction to fishing  Impeding any possible exploitation of mineral wealth  Existing infrastructural facilities (oil and gas pipelines, sea cables, etc.)
