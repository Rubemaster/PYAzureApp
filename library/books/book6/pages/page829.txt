19.3 INVESTMENT COSTS FOR TURNKEY INSTALLATIONS 821wind priority regions, multiple revisions in the planning, caused by numerous objec tions and the resulting requirements set by the approving authorities, are almost the rule. It is difficult to put a figure on the costs of planning up until the building permit is is sued. In the case of large wind park projects, total costs for project development up to close of financial business amount up to 5  of the investment costs. The essential activities are;Procuring the wind turbines is essentially concentrated on concluding a delivery contract with the manufacturing company. Almost all the manufacturers start initially with their standard delivery contracts. When it comes to it, however, there is consider able room to negotiate. The result is often a packet price which contains not only the delivery of the wind turbines but also special equipment systems such as, for example, remote data transmission, and agreements about maintenance and the warranty period.;Transportation to the site as well as the erection and commissioning are considerablecost factors with larger wind turbines. In the case of seriesproduced commercial wind turbines, these costs are normally included in the purchase price. In the case of the costs of transportation, this is only true if the manufacturing companies are not too far away from the installation sites (a few hundreds of kilometres). They do not, therefore, appear under the siterelated costs item of the manufacturer even though, in essence, they do of course belong to this class. However, this general rule does not mean that some manufacturers do not try to claim for additional costs for these items from their customers. Thus, costs of this type can be found on the operator side, too, in a number
