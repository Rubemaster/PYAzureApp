For each rotor blade there is a socalled blade or axismodule which also contains its own servo controller or servo inverter (Fig. 9.27). This handles the actual controlling of the blade pitch drives in accordance with the setpoints of the central computer of the wind turbine and the actual values of the sensors for the rotor blade pitch angle. Frequently, various grid parameters are also detected in order to be able to meet the operational requirements of the grid operator. In addition, the emergency pitch setting is triggered and controlled from here, if necessary.;There is also a battery unit for each rotor blade to provide power in an emergency. As an alternative to conventional lead accumulators or lithium ion batteries, socalled ultra capacitors are also used. These are also capable of storing the energy required for
