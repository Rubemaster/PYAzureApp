The unavoidable inertia of rotor yawing with the wind direction is one cause of reduced output. As discussed in Chapter 5.7, an average incorrect angle with respect to the wind direction must be expected even with sensitive yawing, resulting in a certain power loss. Various investigations have shown the result that a loss of the order of 2 to 3 in the energy yield of the turbine must be expected with a yawing mechanism operating cor rectly. In principle, this loss is accounted for in a measured power characteristic since the turbine also exhibits incorrect angles during the measuring. Nevertheless, losses exceeding the losses determined under test conditions can occur on sites having very frequent wind direction changes.;The operational sequence logic cuts the wind turbine in at a certain wind speed and limits power operation at a predetermined wind speed. At a first glance, this means a restriction of the usable wind speed range and thus also a loss in energy yield (s.a. Chapt. 14.6.7). Beyond that, cutting the turbine in and out has a certain control charac teristic which leads to the processes exhibiting a hysteresis. When the cutin and cutout criteria are not set optimally, this hysteresis can lead to a noticeable power loss at sites having frequently changing mean wind velocities and thus having many cutin and cut out processes. This control loss must, therefore, be minimised by careful adjustment in operation.
