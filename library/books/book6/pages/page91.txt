3.3 WIND ENERGY CONCENTRATORS 75construction. Several variants of this design concept have been tested in the wind tunnel and in the free atmosphere and have confirmed the concentration factors predicted in theory 8. One main problem is the strength of the stator in extreme winds. The blades of the stator have to be movable so that they can be turned out of the wind in order to avoid extreme wind loads. Structural complexity and the cost of the static structure are, therefore, considerable also in this case.;The socalled thermal upwind power plant is based on the idea of generating an air flow, as occurs naturally due to a rise in temperature, i.e. due to differences in air density. In this concept, an updraft or upwind is generated in a high tower surrounded by a groundlevel canopy which absorbs solar radiation (Fig. 3.8) and this upwind drives an air turbine. Strictly speaking, this is not a wind turbine utilising natural wind but rather a solar power concept utilising solar radiation. An advantage of this principle is its application in areas otherwise inaccessible to normal wind power utilisation. An experimental plant with a projected power output of 100 kW was tested in Spain, funded by the German Ministry of Research and Technology (Figs. 3.9 and 3.10). The tests and measurements carried out in 1982 and 1983 yielded a power output of about 50 kW. The promoters pointed out, however, that this design achieves its maximum efficiency only with considerably larger dimensions and that, moreover, cost comparisons would have to be made with plants for the direct utilisation of solar radiation and not with conventional wind turbines 9.
