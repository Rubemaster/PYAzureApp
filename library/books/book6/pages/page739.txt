Fig. 18.5. Required conductor crosssection of a copper cable as a function of the transmission power 3the electrical transmission losses. A number of turbines with the usual generator output voltage of 690 Volts will be connected to a 20kV medium voltage rail via interstage transformers. Before it reaches the substation, the feeder is also conducted to the grid connection point of the medium voltage system at this voltage level (Fig. 18.6).;Most large turbines have their own builtin transformer and the turbines are connected individually to the 20kV lines. The mediumvoltage lines are connected to the substa tion in several rows (Fig. 18.7).;The electrical losses in the turbine array are the direct result of the electrical connection layout chosen. The important parameters are voltage level, cable lengths, cable crosssections and number of transformers. Even in larger wind farms, the power trans mission losses up to the grid should not exceed 2 .;The cables can be run either in the conventional manner in which the cable trenchesare dug out with a digger and filled up again after the cables have been laid. The current method of cable laying by means of a special plough which ploughs the soil with its plough share and at the same time lays the cable is more efficient (Fig. 18.8). Where the surface must not be destroyed, e.g. in the case of roads, the cables can also be run by using a horizontal drilling machine drilling out the cable duct by means of a water jet. The depth of the run depends on the requirements of soil utilisation. Fields used agricul turally require a depth of at least one meter in most cases.
