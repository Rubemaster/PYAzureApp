Fig. 9.33. Bearing designs for traditional shaft mounting two separate single bearings and assem bly in a common pipe housing (Schffler KG)has a certain hidden life since the hydraulic and electrical supply lines, and in some cases also mechanical actuating elements for blade pitch adjustment, are passed through the hollow rotor shaft.;This modular design results in a long inline arrangement of the components andthus to a great overall mass of the loadbearing nacelle bedplate. In large quantities, where the amount of material used becomes the decisive cost factor, this type of design is disadvantageous. In small quantities, the advantages of this concept, i.e. its simple and clear arrangement on a nacelle bedplate, the use of standard gearboxes and bear ings, the easy accessibility, all compensate for the disadvantage of the larger overall mass.
