Damage on the rotor blades is mostly caused by produc tion defects. For example, the bursting of the blade leading edge or socalled delamina tions on the surface manifesting themselves as bulging can be caused by poor bonding work (Fig. 18.53).;Even more frequently, however, there is damage on the roller bearings. This affects therotor blade bearings, the rotor bearings or the bearings in the gearbox and in the electric generator. The factors responsible for this bearing damage are insufficient lubrication, installation defects, occasionally also overheating and abrupt overloads. Figure 18.54 shows an example of a damaged bearing race in a tapered roller bearing.;Fig. 18.53. Damage on a rotor blade. Crack and ero sion on the leading edge
