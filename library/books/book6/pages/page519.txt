  1 2      where f (W) is the wind frequency distribution, a Weibull function, as a rule. Instead of integrating the mathematical Weibull function, the mean value of the third power of the wind speeds in appropriate time intervals can also be used. (Not the cube of the mean annual wind speed!);The most striking characteristic of the wind resource is its variability. The wind is highly variable, both geographically and temporally. This is amplified due to the cubic relationship of the wind speed to available energy. On a large scale the global variability describes the fact that there are many different climatic regions in the world. Within one climatic region, there is a great deal of variation on a smaller scale influenced by the physical geography, the size of land and sea, the topography and vegetation on land. Above the open seas, the wind velocities are highest, whereas they rapidly decrease above the land surfaces. One of the most recent, comprehensive studies about the global distribution of the mean wind velocities and about the usable wind energy potential was published in 2005 by the Stanford University in the US 2. In this study, the data from 7753 ground stations and 446 radar measuring stations were evaluated. Using the usual approaches for the increase in wind velocity with height, especially the exponential
