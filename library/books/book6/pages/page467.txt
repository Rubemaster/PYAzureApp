In principle, using a frequency converter expands the control capabilities also inconjunction with stallcontrolled turbines. Apart from the high costs of a self commutated frequency converter, however, the implementation is impeded by the aforementioned technical problems. The necessity of limiting the speed range over controllable loads remains. In isolated operation, variablespeed operation in conjunc tion with load limiting by means of aerodynamic stall becomes even more complex because the appropriate rotor speed has to be matched to the stall characteristics of the rotor. It is for these reasons, among others, that no successful applications have become known to the present.;In the case of rotors having a socalled active stall control, various, but fixed blade pitch angles are operationally set in order to ensure that the desired flow separation will occur at the rotor blades under the respective prevailing environmental conditions (s.a. Chapt. 5.3.3). The pitch angle is set in dependence on various input variables
