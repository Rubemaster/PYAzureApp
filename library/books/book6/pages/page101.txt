Analogously to the approach described in Chapter 4.1, it can be shown that cP reaches a maximum value with a velocity ratio of     13. The maximum value is then;The order of magnitude of the result becomes clear if it is taken into consideration that the aerodynamic drag coefficient of a concave surface curved against the wind direction can hardly exceed a value of 1.3. Thus, the maximum power coefficient of a pure drag type rotor becomes
