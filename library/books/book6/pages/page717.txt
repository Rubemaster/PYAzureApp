These spheres of interest cannot always be clearly differentiated from one another in individual cases. Loudly voiced objections that the offshore wind turbines could have a negative influence on the fishing industry appear to have economic reasons rather than ecological ones when looked at more closely. Naturally, structures at sea such as off shore wind turbines will present obstacles to the fishing technique using bottom trawling nets, often criticised, with which even the last small plaice are being caught today.;The visibility from land aspect is not a legal criterion per se but it is emphasized par ticularly by nature conservationists and the tourist industry, and appears to be assessed largely uniformly. In Denmark, a minimum distance of 6 km and a desirable distance of 12 km from the coast is stipulated for the large commercial wind farms. From this dis tance, visibility is minimum and is only a factor when the view is very clear. The ideas are similar in Germany. It should be noted in this connection that due to the curvature of the earth, the wind turbines will disappear below the horizon at a distance of 20 to 30 km, in any case.;17.3.4 The First Offshore Wind Parks;With the availability of mature wind turbines in the 500600 kW class at the end of the eighties, the first small offshore test units were started up for demonstration purposes. In 1991, Denmark took into operation the first offshore wind farm near Vindeby off the coast of Lolland (Fig. 17.27).
