736 CHAPTER 18 WIND TURBINE INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONsystem with 110 or 220 kV which in most cases requires the construction of a new trans former substation (Fig. 18.12). In addition, suitable grid infeed points are generally far ther distant since the highvoltage power system is much more widely spaced apart. The costs for connecting a large wind park to the highvoltage grid are thus considerable. On the other hand, the costs for highvoltage switchgear and transformers have dropped in recent years so that this is no longer an insurmountable economic impediment if the wind park is of a certain minimum size.;Fig. 18.12. 20110 kV transformer substation (photo Oelker) Connecting wind farms to the grid requires a number of technical criteria to be observed, especially when dealing with relatively large wind farms. As wind energy utilisation increases, the utilities operating the grid are forced to impose more severe conditions and technical criteria for the grid connection.;Firstly, attention must be paid to the demands made on the wind farm installationwith regard to parallel grid operation as discussed in Chapter 10.7.2. They relate to the control and system management system, particularly
