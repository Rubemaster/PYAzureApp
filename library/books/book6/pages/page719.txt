Utgrunden off the southern Swedish NorthSea coast, Yttre Stengrund (Sweden), Middelgrunden (within sight of the harbour of Copenhagen, Denmark) and Blyth off the British North Sea coast (Fig. 17.29). Middelgrunden, with 20 Bonus wind turbines with a power of 2.0 MW each provides a first indication of the dimensions of future offshore wind parks.;At the same time as the first projects are being implemented, there started a race forthe future sites in almost all areas of the North Sea and Baltic sea, which is driven by numerous private project initiators  often with the support of the large turbine manufac turers. Attempts are being made by the relevant countries to control the development by providing guidelines, in most cases more or less detailed planning for the suitable sites and the capacities which can be installed.;The most advanced planning has been produced for Danish waters 19. Applying some pressure, the Danish government has managed to interest the energy supply companies Elsam and Elkraft in its offshore projects so that, in the meantime, there exists a very solid and wellordered plan for exploiting the offshore potential in Denmark. It is in tended to install at least 4000 MW of wind energy power at various offshore sites by the year 2030. The Danish plan Energie 21 is essentially based on five sites for which extensive suitability studies have been carried out in recent years.
