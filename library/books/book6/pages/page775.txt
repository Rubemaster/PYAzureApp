The software also provides for a statistical analysis of the electrical output power independence on wind velocity over a relatively long period. However, the power curve thus generated must be treated with caution. In most cases, the wind velocity used as a basis in this case is not correct. When the rotor is running, the wind speed measurement taken on the nacelle is incorrect and must be corrected in dependence on power in order to obtain the true, unaffected wind speed as a reference basis. These relationships should be accurately known before farreaching conclusions are drawn from these power statistics (Chapt. 14.2.2).;For some time, early fault detection methods have been developed which use socalled condition monitoring systems. The aim is to be able to predict from certain criteria the occurrence of damage in order to avoid unexpected standstills. This is con sidered to be of importance particularly in relation to the offshore installation of wind turbines. These systems are based on the acquisition of certain characteristic properties of the components, for example their vibration behaviour, the structural sound radiation or the analysis of the power output. The analysis of these data is intended to reveal damage which has already occurred (cracks or abnormal wear phenomena). These sys tems are particularly important for offshore wind turbines.;Fig. 18.42. Shorttime graph (15 minutes) of wind velocity, rotor speed and electrical power output of a TW1.5S turbine (GE)
