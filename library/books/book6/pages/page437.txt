424 CHAPTER 10 ELECTRICAL SYSTEMassociated with a certain expenditure. Depending on the siting of the turbine, an ice warning device or even electrical resistance heating for deicing the rotor blades may also be necessary (see Chapt. 18.8).;The electrotechnical equipment of small wind turbines must basically meet the same requirements as large turbines if they are used for feeding into the grid. However, tur bines yielding some tens or hundreds of kilowatts commonly have electrotechnical solutions which overall result in much simpler systems. Above all, combining the elec trotechnical and controlrelated equipment in one switchbox, as is possible in small turbines, creates more favourable conditions for service and maintenance (Fig. 10.39).;Combining the general electrical equipment and electronic control system in compactform reduces the price both of component production as well as of the assembly of the elec trical system, a considerable cost factor in large turbines. The switchbox is mounted at the foot of the tower, or also freestanding next to the turbine. The electrical system of a small turbine of the Aeroman type is shown in Fig. 10.40.
