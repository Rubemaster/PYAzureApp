The rotor blades of the experimental SwedishUS turbines WTS3 and WTS4 wereproduced as fully wound components (Fig. 8.14). The connecting structure to the hub consisted of an inner and an outer annular flange between which the composite structure was bonded and screwed together. A rotor blade with a length of 38 m weighed approx. 13 metric tonnes of which approx. 4.5 tonnes were attributable to the metallic flange.;(Figs. 8.15 and 8.16). After that, a core in the geometric shape of the rear airfoil cross section was positioned on the spar after which spar and core were again wrapped. After the whole assembly had been cured, the core was removed.;The winding technique is still used today for rotor blades made of fibrereinforcedcomposites. For example, the spar of the rotor blades of VESTAS is manufactured using this technique. The disadvantage of not being able to orientate the directions of the wound fibres optimally in accordance with the direction of the stresses is compensated by implementing carbonfibre layers with a spanwise fibre orientation. The advantage of being able to mechanise the production to a large extent will be preserved.
