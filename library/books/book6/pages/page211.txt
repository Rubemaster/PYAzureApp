The humidity of the air is of less influence under normal atmospheric conditions. Ac cording to IEC a value of 95 is acceptable.;One of the environmental factors which may contribute to extraordinary loads is the buildup of ice on the rotor blades. But even thick ice formations on the rotor blades do not cause the danger of severe failure loads. Similar to aircraft wings, aerodynamic lift is reduced, with the consequence that rotor performance is reduced, and with it the aerodynamic loading (see Chapt. 18.8.2). The load assumptions distinguish between rotating parts (rotor) and nonrotating parts. For the nonrotating parts, an ice accretion of 30 mm is assumed. For the rotor blades, a varying mass distribution of the accreted ice from the root of the blade to its tip is assumed, and a difference in ice accretion between the individual blades 2.;The salt content of the air requires special design features in the area of cooling and ventilation and, naturally, special methods for the surface treatment of steel compo nents. This is particularly true in the offshore region.;One load case which is fortunately very rare can be caused by a large bird colliding with the rotating rotor. To take this hazard into consideration, the earlier Swedish load as sumptions suggested some assumptions about impact velocity and bird weight 13. The resulting impact may be of significance for the dimensioning of the rotor blade shell.
