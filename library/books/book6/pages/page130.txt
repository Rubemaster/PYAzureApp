The aerodynamic brakes are released by a centrifugal switch at a certain permissible overspeed of the rotor. In more recent turbine types, the air brakes are operated hydrau lically, permitting the brakes to be retracted automatically. This considerably simplifies operation when starting up again. However, it is also associated with considerable con structional complexity which somewhat negates the basic simplicity of a rotor with fixed blade pitch angle.;Many Danish manufacturers of wind turbines initially attempted to transfer the proven technology of stall control with fixed blade pitch angle to the larger systems of the megawatt power range. Practical operation, however, soon revealed considerable disad vantages of doing so. The adjustable rotor tips, an indispensable feature of aerodynamic rotor braking es pecially in the case of large rotors, became more and more complex constructional. The concentrated loads on the outer area of the blade during braking proved to be very un pleasant. In addition, the loads experienced with extreme wind velocities in standstill are also much higher than with pitchcontrolled turbines, resulting in economic disad vantages for the larger dimensions of the tower and its foundation. Not least, the stall characteristics also became more difficult to calculate aerodynamically and to predict reliably with increasing size of the rotor (s. Chapt. 5.3.4). In operation, too, the familiar disadvantages of fixedblade rotors became more appar ent with increasing turbine size. In the megawatt range, the large fluctuations of the tur bine output power can no longer be tolerated in an increasing number of situations of grid operation. Another problem is the influence of air density on the onset of stall at
