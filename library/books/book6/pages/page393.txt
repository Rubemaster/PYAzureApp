The two choices for the yaw drive are hydraulic or electrical components, the same as for the blade pitch drive. Both configurations are common practice in wind turbines. In the first generation of larger turbines, hydraulic yaw drives outnumbered electric ones. Promoters of the hydraulic system name lower costs, smaller size and also higher torque as advantages. On the other hand, there are problems with stiffness, requiring careful analysis of the dynamic characteristics (Chapt. 11.2). Another advantage of hydraulic yaw drives is that they are easy to control compared with electric drives. The power of the drive motors depends on the rate of adjustment required (Chapt. 10.2).;Comparable to the blade pitch systems, electric motors are being increasingly used inmore recent yaw drives (Fig. 9.71). The hydraulic drives are being replaced by the con trollable electric drive motors. Some manufacturers are using electric yaw drives with integrated brakes so that separate yaw brakes are no longer required (e.g. Enercon E 40). There have also been proposals for controllable yaw drives with a damping type of hydraulic clutch which go by the name soft yaw drive 21.
