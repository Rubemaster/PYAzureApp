This small wind farm consists of 11 turbines sited in water 3 to 4 meters deep, eachwith a power output of 450 kW. The maximum distance from the coast is approx. 3 km. The cost of construction is stated as being 76.2 million DKr 18. According to the builders, the investment costs were about twice the amount required for a location on land.;In the following ten years, further, relatively small demonstration projects were implemented in Denmark, Holland and Sweden (Table 17.28). Their main features are very similar   slightly modified wind turbines of the 500600 kW class  water depth 3 to 10 m  distance from the coast up to 6 km  These demonstration projects were thus not subject to the requirements encountered by an offshore technology that can be used commercially, with much greater water depth and distance from the shore. The construction costs were also too high for achieving an economic efficiency comparable to siting on land. On the other hand, the experience was encouraging enough so that now almost all the countries bordering on the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are building large commercial offshore wind farms or at least have plans to do so.;Table 17.28. Offshore demonstration projects from 1990 to 1998;The first steps in the direction of commercial offshore wind energy utilisation were taken at the end of the nineties. By now, tried and tested wind turbines of the megawatt class were available. Given this turbine size, it was possible to go to greater depths of water. The first projects implemented under commercial aspects were the wind farms of
