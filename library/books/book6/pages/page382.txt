Similarly to the gearbox, the generator is mounted on its supporting nacelle bedplate by means of elastomeric bearings (Fig. 9.59). The flexible mounting ensures that no stresses are produced in the mechanical drive train in the case of structural deformations, and also prevents structureborne noise from being transmitted.;Fig. 9.59. Flexible generator mounting on the nacelle bedplate in the GE 1.5 S turbine;In all larger turbines, the components of the mechanical drive train and of the electric generator are housed in a closed nacelle. Some smaller turbines make do without it. A completely closed housing could become unnecessary in case of a complete integration of the drive train components. After all, the nacelle does represent a considerable cost factor. On the other hand, many practical reasons speak for a closed nacelle, particularly in large turbines.;Apart from the major components of the mechanical drive train and the electrical gen erator, a number of auxiliary units and builtins would also have to be accommodated in the nacelle. These include the systems for supplying the units with lubrication and cool ing air and a number of pieces of equipment for providing for the operational functions of the wind turbine and, not lastly, for facilitating the maintenance and repair work. These addons need space and must be easily accessible which is why they also include the gangways and platforms for the maintenance personnel.
