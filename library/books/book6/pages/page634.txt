Apart from shadow casting there is another effect caused by the sun, which occasionally can be felt annoying. When the sun is shining, the rotor blades can have an unpleasant flashing effect when the sunlight is strongly reflected. This phenomenon is counteracted by applying a nonreflective coating which reduces the degree of glare as defined in DIN standard DIN 67530.;Like other large buildings, wind turbines can interfere with the transmission of electro magnetic waves. Basically, all types of navigational or communicationrelated systems are affected by this. As the interference is concentrated on a small area, interference with navigational or directional radio link routes can be avoided by choosing an appro priate site for the turbine. The situation is different with regard to the reception of public radio and television, as these are used virtually everywhere. In the USA and Sweden, the problem of interference with radio and television has been examined in more detail
