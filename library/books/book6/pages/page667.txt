658 CHAPTER 16 COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF WIND TURBINESthat the grid is handling the speed control. In this way, wind turbines without blade pitch control can be operated on the grid without any control problems (Chapt. 10.3.2).;In principle, a small single wind turbine operated by a private consumer could beused for supplying the electricity consumers directly. However, this type of application is technically complicated and leads to the problems of isolated operation (Chapt. 10.3 and 10.4). For this reason, the power supplied by the turbine is fed directly into the grid via a meter in the same way as of large wind parks in nearly all cases. The consumer continues to keep his regular grid connection via the existing meter (Fig. 16.13). Billing by the proper utility company is handled via separate meters for injected power and for received power. It is only in rare cases that a consumer is connected directly, for in stance with an electrical resistance heating system, so that only the excess energy is being fed into the grid.;Even when considering todays largest wind turbines with a rated power of several megawatts, the power output of one single wind turbine is a small amount when com pared to the power of a conventional power station. If the share of wind power in the overall energy supply is to become worth mentioning, the problem becomes one of numbers, the distributed installation of wind turbines according to the maxim Every consumer with his own wind turbine! quickly meets its limits in more densely popu lated countries. As much as a completely decentralised supply structure based on other technologies would have undeniable advantages, there is a number of reasons why this wouldnt work with wind turbines. In most countries, areas with technically usable wind speeds are restricted to certain regions. This creates the necessity of concentrating as many wind turbines as possible in these regions, regardless of the local energy demand.
