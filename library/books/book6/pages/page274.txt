A comparison with the large Swedish WTS75 and WTS3 turbines and the American WTS4 sister model is particularly interesting. In a way, they represented the key elements in the wide range of vibrational design.;The WTS75 stood for the stiff design (Fig. 7.23). However, the consequences wereobvious the concrete tower weighed a colossal 1500 tonnes! The concept of the WTS 34 is the exact opposite. In combination with a twobladed teetering rotor, a soft tower between 1 P and 2 P was chosen for the Swedish WTS3 (Fig. 7.24). The American version WTS4 even had a doublesoft tower with a first natural bending frequency below 1 P. Experience with the vibrational characteristics of the WTS4 showed, how ever, that these extremely flexible tower designs lead to problems at least with this large twobladed turbine. The tower heads vibration amplitudes were described as extremely unpleasant.;With regard to their vibrational behaviour, turbines with threebladed rotors are moreunproblematic. Above all, there is no strong excitation of the yawing movement with respect to tower torsion, typical of the twobladed rotor. An example of a turbine with a threebladed rotor is the Tjaereborg turbine (Fig. 7.25). It is representative of the tradi tional Danish line. The concrete tower has a soft design with respect to the critical 1 P excitation, i.e. the rotor passes through the tower resonance during the startup se quence.;More recent threebladed turbines with steel towers all have flexible towers with anatural bending frequency between 1 P and 2 P or even below 1 P. As the size of wind turbines increases and they are being economically optimised, the reduction in tower mass thus achieved has clearly become a factor which is no longer negligible. In addi tion, the vibrational characteristics of wind turbines are increasingly being brought
