This is the oldest and simplest method and is suitable only for relatively small compo nents which are made only in small numbers. The fibre mats are here impregnated nor mally in the resin and placed into the mould in layers. The quality depends greatly on the skill and reliability of the persons doing the job.;The use of prepregs, i.e. preimpregnated fibre mats means a certain mechanisation and is a step towards reproducible quality. The epoxy resin prepregs are supplied as semi finished products. They are laid into the mould and cured at relatively high temperatures (100  150 C). This means that the mould must be heated. This method, too, is labour intensive and relatively expensive but, on the other hand, it provides good conditions for achieving a high quality. Using prepregs offers advantages especially when the compo nents are made of carbon fibre which is why the rotor blade manufacturers often use prepregs at the corresponding locations for their mixeddesign rotor blades.;The vacuum infusion method used frequently today is an alternative to using prepregs. After the fibre mats have been placed into the rotor blade mould, it is sealed with plastic foil and then evacuated (Fig. 8.20). The resin is introduced into the mould by means of a pump and is sucked in by the vacuum. This largely prevents the formation of strengthreducing air inclusions. It also reduces the formation of unhealthy vapours by the resin. The vacuum infusion method has been adopted by most of the rotor blade manufacturers today, mainly for cost reasons (Fig. 8.21).
