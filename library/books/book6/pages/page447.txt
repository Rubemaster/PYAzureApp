In large turbines, power and speed are controlled without directly measuring the wind speed. Attempting to measure the wind speed and to use it as a direct input value for the control system would raise considerable problems. Whatever locality the wind speed is measured at, a value obtained at selected points only will never be representa tive of the power generated by a large wind rotor which sweeps an area of several thou sand square meters. Incorrect reactions of the speed or power control system would be unavoidable. To avoid these problems, it is better to measure the wind speed indirectly via the electric power delivered. The only representative anemometer of a wind tur bine is the wind rotor itself.;The electric power is measured at the electrical interface between the wind turbineand the grid so that the consumption by the wind turbine itself is already subtracted. This effective power delivered into the grid is the input signal for the power control system. Depending on the position of the power transformer, however, information may be required whether it is the power before or after the transformer which is the reference value. The power measurement should cover current and voltage for each phase of the three phase system (Fig. 11.4). The range of measurements should have a bandwidth of 50 to 200  of the rated power so that power peaks can also be detected 3. The test instru ments include a commercially available threephase activepower transducer for meas uring the power and current transformers for measuring the electric current. According to the IEC, an accuracy class of at least 0.5 is specified for both instruments (s. Chapt. 14.2.2).
