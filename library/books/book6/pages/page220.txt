6.6 STRUCTURAL STRESSES IN THE WIND TURBINE 205numbers of 107 to 108 are at the limit of current experience. These uncertainties must be compensated for by particularly fatigueresistant designs or by higher safety factors.;The second issue is the alternating loads resulting from the wind turbulence. Map ping these loads correctly by means of a suitable turbulence model requires a profound understanding of the characteristics of wind. There are no relevant suitably comprehen sive models from other fields of technology in existence. Although the influence of wind turbulence on material fatigue is known also in aeronautical engineering or in the aerodynamics of tall, slender buildings, the conditions are quite different in both fields. For this reason, the methods developed here can be translated to wind power technology only with regard to the basic assumptions.;In simple stress situations with static loads, it is sufficient to calculate the structural strength separately for individual load situations or load cases. If a safe fatigue life is required with alternating loads, elementary fatigue strength theory assumes that stress fluctuations occur with constant amplitudes within the lifetime of a component. If the stress amplitudes are below the fatigue strength of the material, then the number of load cycles no longer plays a role, i.e. changes in load can be endured any number of times. If the stress amplitudes are higher than the fatigue strength allows, only a certain num ber of load fluctuations can be sustained, i.e. the material is only fatiguelimited. In the case of steel, this mechanism is represented by the wellknown Whlerline. This fatigue model has been found useful for normal engineering problems.
