A foundation with a freestanding steel pipe which is rammed into the sea floor is called a monopile foundation (Figs. 17.4 and 17.5). This comparatively simple solution is preferred wherever the external conditions are suitable, especially for cost reasons.;A monopile foundation requires virtually no preparation of the sea bed but the seabottom must consist of sand or gravel in order to avoid expensive drilling work. De pending on the foundation soil, the steel pipe is rammed into the sea floor to a depth of 10 to 20 m with a hydraulic hammer from a floating platform. This type of heavy as sembly equipment must be available for this purpose. On top of the pile a socalled transition piece with a somewhat larger diameter is used. The structure covers the head of the pile which is always damaged by the ramming procedure and it supports the tower of the turbine.;From the point of view of vibration characteristics, a monopile foundation is a soft system. The natural frequencies of the tower of the wind turbine can only be determined in the overall tower with monopile system. The soft response of the structure effectively reduces the fatigue load spectrum. Since this design is capable of vibration, however, the length, and thus the range of application, is also restricted with regard to the depth of the water to a maximum of 25 m according to current opinion.
