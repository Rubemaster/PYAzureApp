7.5.2 Vibrational Characteristics of Existing Wind Turbines;Designers initially achieved control over the vibrational behaviour of wind turbines by means of various designs. Proponents of the stiff design stood in opposition to those favouring the soft line. It only emerged in the course of the development that the prob lematic and risky flexible line became the preferred design. It was found that, particularly with the increasing size of turbines, the weight saving in the tower which could be achieved by the flexible design represents a considerable economic benefit. Since then, the soft tower concept is generally considered to be the more advanced design and is,
