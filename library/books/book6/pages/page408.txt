The decreasing costs of the permanent magnets have encouraged the industry to use this technology for electric generators in the megawattpower range. Standard highspeed generators with permanent excitation have been on offer for some time (Fig. 10.12). The efficiency of these generators achieves values exceeding 98 (Fig. 10.13). In the recent years they are used for wind turbines by an increasing number of manufactures.;Fig. 10.12. Highspeed permanent magnet generator, 2.5 MW rated power (ABB);Fig. 10.13.
