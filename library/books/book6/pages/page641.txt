There is no doubt that in densely populated Central Europe accumulations of smallwind turbines in this manner would be visually unacceptable. The many recent wind parks in Europe show that there are better solutions.;It is a general experience, everybody can do oneself, the size of an installed wind turbine is very difficult to assess. From a certain distance a multimegawatt turbine with a hub height of 100 m or more, has nearly the same appearance in the landscape as a smaller turbine, lets say with 50 or 60 m height. For this reason, among others, wind energy utilisation in Europe will essentially have to rely on larger wind turbines.; The size of the wind turbine Turbines with less than 50 m height are usuallymasked easily in most cultivated and builtup landscapes. Wind turbines with a height exceeding 50 m dominate the landscape over long distances.;The study concludes that the installation of wind turbines in wind parks can be accepted in most landscapes, as long as the distance between the individual turbines is of the order of between 5 to 10 rotor diameters. It is only in a few areas that the visual impact is considered to be so dominating that justifiable objections would have to be expected.
