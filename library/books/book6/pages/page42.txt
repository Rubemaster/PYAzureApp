Fig. 2.2. LaCourLykkegard wind turbine in Denmark. (rotor diameter 18 m, approx. 30 kW power output at 12 ms wind speed) 4;Problems with the dynamic characteristics of the twobladed rotor caused the company to develop a second, larger type with three rotor blades (Fig. 2.5). With a rotor diameter of 24 m, it yielded a power output of about 70 kW at a wind speed of about 10 ms. Seven wind turbines of this type were built, all of them with concrete towers.;Except for one, all Smidth Aeromotors were equipped with DC generators. Many ofthe features of their aerodynamic and mechanical design are typical of the Danish line to the present day. It can be rightly stated that in the first half of the 20th century, elec tricity generation from wind power was already more than an experiment in Denmark. Even if, measured against the total electricity generation, the proportion of wind elec tricity will have been a matter of only a few percent, in some areas at least electricity from wind power was a first solution for supplying electric energy.
