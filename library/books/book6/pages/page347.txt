9.5.3 Electrically Driven Blade Pitch Systems;In the beginning of modern wind turbine technology, electrical blade pitching used to be an exception in wind turbines. In principle, it is much more difficult to control electrical pitching drives. The speed and torque of common electric motors can only be controlled in practice by using frequency converters. Otherwise highly expensive directcurrent units must be used. The ability to control the rate of pitch adjustment is essential in large turbines so that the loads on the rotor blades can be limited.;Today, electronicallycontrolled pitch motors of very compact design are availablewhich has led to the increasing use of electrical blade pitching drives by wind turbine manufacturers. The first one of these was Enercon where each rotor blade on their me diumsized range of turbines (E40) has its own electric pitch motor. In recent years, significant advances have been achieved in the field of electric blade pitch drives and their control systems. The suppliers have adapted themselves and are supplying the components as massproduced articles.;The actual blade pitch drive consists of a socalled slewing gearbox, a compact unit consisting of an electric drive motor flanged to a planetary gearbox with a high gear ratio (Fig. 9.26). Both threephase motors and DC motors are used. Such slewing gear boxes are also used for numerous other applications in engineering so that they are available relatively costeffectively.
