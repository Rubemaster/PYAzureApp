A look at the time correlation between wind energy supply and heating demandshows that it is not possible to cover the demand with the wind turbine alone. Surplus wind energy can only be utilised with the help of storage, which would decouple energy supply and demand in time. Theoretically, by using an energy store, the total annual heat demand of the house could be more than covered with the given size of wind tur bine. The computer simulation shows, however, that a store permitting complete cover age over the entire heating season by wind power alone, would become uneconomically large.;For this reason, the economic solution is a hybrid system a wind turbine combinedwith a conventional heating system. The overall system could consist of a separate elec tric heating system or of electrical resistance heating which would be integrated into the water cycle of a thermal heating system. The second possibility is more suitable for retrofitting to an existing central heating system. For this, a small additional energy store can be quite economical, so that at least a certain proportion of the otherwise un usable wind energy can be stored and utilised. In the example shown, wind energy could cover about 90  of the heating demand.
