where H  mean wind velocity at elevation H (ms)   mean wind speed at reference elevation Href (ms) H  height (m)   reference elevation (measuring elevation) (m) ln  natural logarithm (base e  2.7183) Strictly speaking, the validity of the logarithmic height formula is restricted to the Prandtl layer close to the ground. There are numerous approaches to improving the accuracy of this formula and taking into consideration, for example, the influence of atmospheric stability or taking into account the fact that the increase in wind speed with altitude also indicates a dependence on the wind speed itself. To be able to handle the more detailed method in practice, however, several parameters, unknown as a rule, must be estimated so that it is questionable whether better results are achieved in every case.
