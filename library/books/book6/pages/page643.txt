634 CHAPTER 15 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTin operation, anyway. Due to this, critical weather conditions, where a wind flow would be desirable for mixing up the air, are not affected in any case.;In weather conditions with high wind speeds, i.e. when the wind turbines are in operation,;In weather conditions with high wind speeds, i.e. when the wind turbines are in operation,it is not low wind speeds but wind speeds which are too high which pose an environmental problem. In many regions today, increasing dryness and land clearance are leading to highly undesirable soil erosion due to high wind speeds. If there were a measurable wind speed reduction caused by high numbers of wind turbines at all, it is by no means certain that this would have any negative effects on the climate. The opposite is more than likely. Any theo retically conceivable effect of wind turbines on the environmental climate can, therefore, be faced without any worries. The utilisation of wind energy would have to have achieved vast dimensions before this problem becomes relevant, if it should become a problem at all.;15.8.2 Utilisation of Wind Power and CO2 Emissions;Every electrical kilowatthour generated by wind power avoids the same amount having to be generated by coal and gasfired power stations, since the wind energy fed in ir regularly must be corrected mainly by the controllable generator sets of the medium sized and smaller coal and gasfired power stations. Given these conditions, detailed examinations of the way wind energy is fed into the electricity grid and the interaction with the conventional power stations show that one kilowatthour of wind energy pre vents the emission of 856 g CO2 (Fig. 15.20).
