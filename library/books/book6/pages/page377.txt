Dewind D8 turbine. The first prototypes are being tested. But so far no experiences or measured results have been published.;To achieve a variablespeed operation of the rotor with the aid of mechanical gearing always means having to use a comparatively complex technology which is thus also po tentially susceptible to faults. Aiming only at eliminating the dynamic load peaks in the mechanical part of the drive train is less challenging. At least it creates the requisite condi tions for using also conventional synchronous generators. (s.a. Chapt. 10.1.1). The first trials with this aim go back to the nineteeneighties when various concepts were tried out in the experimental turbines of the day.;The American MOD2 experimental turbines were equipped with synchronous genera tors directly connected to the grid and had a torsionally elastic rotor shaft, called quill shaft (Fig. 9.54), installed on the inside of the supporting hollow rotor shaft to the gear box. The torsion angle under load reached a magnitude corresponding to a generator slip of approximately 5 . However, the lack of damping proved to be a grave disadvantage, presenting considerable problems with drive train dynamics in these turbines. For the subsequent MOD5 model, a variablespeed generator system was developed to replace the torsionflexible rotor shaft.
