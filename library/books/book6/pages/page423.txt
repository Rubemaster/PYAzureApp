The most recent stage in the evolution of static converter technology is characterizedby the use of transistors. Transistors require virtually no reactive power and have even better switching capabilities. They represent todays state of the art as socalled insu lated gate bipolar transistors, (IGBT inverters). These inverters have virtually displaced the GTO inverters and are therefore also found increasingly in wind turbines.;Using converter valves, socalled cycloconverters select certain voltage segmentsfrom the three phases and reassemble them so that a new frequency is produced. This type of design can be applied only up to a limited frequency ratio and requires great complexity in semiconductor elements and control technology. These inverters are no longer of significance in wind power technology.
