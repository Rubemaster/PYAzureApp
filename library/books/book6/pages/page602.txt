The next chapters show the influence of the most important parameters on the energyyield by means of a parameter study performed using the former mentioned example of a 3 MW wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 100 m. The underlying wind regime has an annual wind speed of 7.5 ms at hub height and a wind speed frequency distribution of k  2.0.;The aerodynamic design of the rotor of a wind turbine poses the problem of having to estimate the economic effects of altered aerodynamic performance data. This concerns, for example, the choice of rotor blade airfoils, the number of blades and other aerody namically significant characteristics of the rotor. The effects become apparent in the rotor power coefficient or, more precisely, in the variation of the cPRlines in the set of rotor power characteristics. In a slightly simplified way, the maximum rotor power coefficient achieved can be used as a criterion (Chapt 5.5). From the point of view of the operator of a wind turbine, the question arises of how much a better power coefficient is worth from economic angles of view.
