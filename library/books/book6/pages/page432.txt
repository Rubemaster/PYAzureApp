10.5.2 DirectDrive Generators with PermanentMagnet Excitation;The goal of reaching a more compact construction has moved especially the developers of directdriven multipole generators for wind turbines to employ the permanentmagnet technology. An increasing number of manufactures are developing new turbines incorpo rating this technology. Some manufactures already are producing gearless wind turbines with permanent magnet generators in series production for example Vensys, Leitner of ScanWind in Norway. The Chinese company Goldwind produces large numbers of the Vensys 1.5 MW design since 2009 (Fig. 10.37).;But the first generation of directdriven generators, particularly those with electric excitation had the disadvantage that the towerhead weight and the manufacturing costs were higher compared to the standard design including a gearbox. Certainly one could argue that the gearless design will have lower maintenance costs and probably also its service life is more advantageous. Some representatives of the latest generation of gear less turbines based on permanent magnet generators obviously can beat the standard
