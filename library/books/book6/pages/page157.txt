Winglets have been found to be more effective. The rotor blade tips are here bent over (Fig. 5.52). Using such winglets makes it possible to influence the tip vortices at the end of the rotor blade and thus to reduce the drag and to a limited extend also the noise emission. These effects are achieved especially in the case of high lift coefficients. They are also found in many aircraft wings for the same reason. In addition, the wing lets also have a certain wingspanenlarging or, in the case of wind turbines, respec tively, diameterenlarging aerodynamic effect. Therefore a precise calculation of the rotor power coefficient should consider this effect, that means that the aerodynamic effective rotor diameter respective rotor swept area should be used as reference.
