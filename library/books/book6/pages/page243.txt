Another important task is the determination of the most important natural frequencies. Ona test stand, where the cantilevered rotor blade is fixed at the root and is induced to vibrate, both natural frequencies and vibration modes can be measured with high precision. Al though the natural frequencies determined under these conditions do not correspond exactly to the natural frequencies of the rotating rotor, the predicted stiffness parameters of the non rotating blade can still be verified in this way.;6.9.2 Data Acquisition Systems and Field Measurements;Inquiring into the loads and structural stresses actually existing is, of course, possible only on the wind turbine itself. The usual approach is to measure the deflections of the selected components by means of strain gauges and then to deduce the material stress values. However, to obtain a complete overview of the entire load spectrum requires arduous, longterm measurement campaigns the results of which only become meaning ful after a large amount of data has been statistically processed. Analysing the results in detail can be very difficult. Correlating the results with the causes of the loads can only be carried out to a limited extent, as the structural deformations only reflect the sum of all loads. To isolate aerodynamic loads, for example, is extraordinarily difficult. Similar problems are presented when particular load states are to be correlated with the events triggering them, for example individual gusts.;One of the first systematic measuring programmes was carried out by NASA in theyears 1977 to 1979 during a SwedishAmerican test programme using the earlier Danish wind turbine at Gedser 19. From 1976 to 1986 comprehensive measurements were taken out in the American wind energy programme with the experimental MOD0 20. This was followed by the publication of measurements made on the large experimental turbines such as MOD1, MOD2, WTS4 and Growian 21, 22. One of the results is shown in Figure 6.37.
