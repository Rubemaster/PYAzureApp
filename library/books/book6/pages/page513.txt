Pile foundations for weak soils have a bedplate sitting on piles which transfer the loads into loadbearing ground layers. For this purpose, prefabricated ram piles are used (Fig. 12.34). Pile foundations are necessary, for example, in the German coastal marsh land areas near the North Sea.;In these areas, the solid sand layers of the continental shelf are in some cases located at adepth of 20 to 25 m. The piles, up to 20 of which are required for a mediumsized turbine, are of corresponding length to ensure the loadcarrying capability of the foundation. This increases the costs of the foundation by 30 to 50 .
