The rotor blades do not necessarily have to be adjusted over their entire length, although fullspan pitch control is aerodynamically the most effective and most satisfac tory solution. In view of the fact that power is generated mainly in the outer blade area of the rotor, partialspan pitch control by adjusting the pitch of only 25 to 30  of the blade length is sufficient from the point of view of aerodynamic efficiency. This method was applied mainly in large twobladed rotors, for example in the American MOD2 turbine (Fig. 5.23), which was equipped with an hydraulically operated pitch control system where 25  of the blade length could be varied. This concept allowed the two bladed rotor to be manufactured in one piece without break due to a hub  an elegant solution from the manufacturing point of view.;Apart from the practical difficulties of implementing a reliable pitch control mechanism in the outer blade area, however, some aerodynamic disadvantages must not be overlooked. In the outer, adjustable area of the rotor blades the aerodynamic loads in crease. At extreme wind velocities, loads on the parked rotor are also higher as it is not possible to turn the complete rotor blade into the feathered position. Moreover, partial span pitch control requires a wider range of pitch angles to achieve the same efficiency as with fullspan pitch control.
