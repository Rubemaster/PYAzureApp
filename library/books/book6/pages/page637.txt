A question which is frequently raised by animal lovers, which the author definitely considers himself to be as well Do wind turbines present a special danger to birds? Observations at various turbines have shown that local birds quickly learn to identify the obstacle and fly around it. The comparatively slowly turning rotor blades are obvi ously noticed by them. It is conceivable, though, that birds without local experience, i.e. migratory birds, can come to harm through wind turbines (Fig. 15.15). But flocks of migratory birds rarely fly at altitudes of less than 200 m, so that this hazard, too, should be a very slight one. In Denmark, the question of wind turbines presenting a possible hazard to migratory birds has been the subject of various investigations. More recently, wind farms near Tarifa in southern Spain were also the object of reports stating that a large number of dead birds had been found, a highly exaggerated figure as it later turned out. In the wind farms in the US, only a very small number of birds killed verifiably by wind turbines have been found to date.;Sometimes there is the argument that the installation of wind turbines will preventthe birds from coming to these regions, particularly if their breeding places are in the area. Naturally, efforts must be made to keep wind turbines away from special breeding places. On the other hand, all kinds of developments have this effect of restricting the living space of birds which used to live there and power generation by wind turbines, too, is involved in this conflict between undisturbed nature and the requirements of a technical civilisation.
