With its many joints and bolts, Halladays wind turbine was a comparatively complex machine. Although it was manufactured until 1929, it remained rather a rarity. The Reverend Leonhard R. Wheeler of Wisconsin found a simpler solution a few years later. Instead of dividing the windwheel into sectors, Wheeler mounted an additional wind vane which was positioned at right angles to the wind direction. This vane was used to turn the entire wind wheel out of the wind. The vane was connected to a weight, so that when the wind speed decreased, the wheel turned back into its original position (Fig. 1.20). Wheelers concept was manufactured under the name of Eclipse and became the standard design of the American wind turbine.
