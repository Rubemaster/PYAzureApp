USSR in Balaklava, not far from Yalta on the Crimean peninsula (Fig. 2.8). The wind turbine with the name WIME D30 had a threebladed rotor with 30 m diameter and a generator rated power of 100 kW. The rotor speed was regulated with the aid of control flaps. Yawing was carried out by moving the entire wind turbine on a circular rail track 13.;This wind turbine was operated from 1931 to 1942 and was said to have operated comparatively reliably. The electricity it generated was fed into a small grid, which was sup plied by a 20 MW steam power station. A second, similar wind turbine with the name of ZWEI D30 was installed a few years later on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. It had a con ventional tower and a yawing system with two fantails.;The apparently good results of these experimental turbines encouraged the builders todesign a 5000kW wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 100 m. Similar to the MAN  Kleinhenz project, however, these plans, too, fell victim to the war.;Fig. 2.8.
