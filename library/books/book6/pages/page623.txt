The primary noise source of a wind turbine is the air flowing around the rotor. The noises caused by this process are, to a certain extent, unavoidable, and cannot be attenu ated either. They are thus the actual problem to be dealt with and their mechanisms of generation must be examined more thoroughly.;On closer inspection, various effects are responsible for the generation of aerodynamic noise from a wind rotor. The main causes are the turbulent boundary layer and the formation of vortices at the trailing edge of the blade, and aerodynamic loading fluctuations. Moreover, there are the flow separations, which are also audible and, to a much lesser extent, the turbulence of the rotor wake. A special role is played by the vortices separating from the tip of the rotor blade. The major part of the rotor noise  as well as the rotor power  emanates from the outer 25 percent of the blade and, therefore, the geometry of the blade tips is of special importance (Chapt. 5.5.2). The influence of other vortexgenerating edges, gaps or struts should not be underestimated, either. These are the causes of loud aerodynamic noises in many rotors of earlier design.;The flow around the rotor blades generates a sound similar to the flow around an aircraft wing. A lowflying glider with an air speed comparable to that of the rotor blade of a wind turbine generates the same broad hissing or whooshing sound in the fre quency range of about one thousand Hertz (Fig. 15.3).
