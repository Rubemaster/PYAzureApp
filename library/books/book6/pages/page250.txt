The same considerations and definitions basically apply to threebladed rotors. Themain difference is that the critical aerodynamic rotor excitation occurs at 3 P instead of 2 P. For the soft tower design, there is yet another option, namely between 3 P and 2 P, between 2 P and 1 P and below 1 P.;Fig. 7.2. Exciting frequencies as a function of rotor speed A fundamental factor in the vibrational characteristics of a wind turbine is theposition of the natural frequencies of the critical components of the wind turbine with respect to these exciting frequencies. This applies especially to the natural bending frequency of the tower (s.a. Chapt. 7.5).;One of the first prerequisites for avoiding unwanted vibrations and structural failure is that the rotor blades are aeroelastically stable. Aeroelastic instabilities arise when a cumulative interaction develops between the deformations of the elastic structure and the resultant aerodynamic forces. Elements creating lift, such as aircraft wings, are es pecially prone to this. Calculation methods for detecting aeroelastic instabilities have, therefore, been developed above all in aeronautical engineering and can be applied directly to the rotor blades 2. Basically, the most varied types of aeroelastic instability phenomena exist, but in this book only the most important ones can be discussed.;A phenomenon known from the behaviour of aircraft wings is the torsional instability of the wing at a certain flying speed. This effect depends on the relative position of the socalled elastic axis, which is the imaginary axis around which the wing twists free of moments, and of the aerodynamic centre. In almost all airfoils, the aerodynamic centre, the point of attack
