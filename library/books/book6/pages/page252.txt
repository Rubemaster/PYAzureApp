238 CHAPTER 7 VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICSresonances with the first flapwise frequency from the mass imbalance (1P excitation) and from the aerodynamic imbalance, the vertical wind shear and the tower influence (3P). A resonance with the 3P excitation would only occur at 18 rpm. The other excitations of higher harmonics have little energy and, do not, therefore, lead to hazardous resonance phenomena. Considering the entire speed range, i.e. also the partialload range in which the rotor is oper ated with variable speed, there are several points of resonance with the higher harmonics. Since, on the one hand, the turbine does not stay at a certain speed for very long and these exciting frequencies are also not very rich in energy, these resonances do not present any danger.;Fig. 7.4. Natural frequencies and eigenmodes of an Euros rotor blade of 44 m length 3 If necessary, the vibrational behaviour of the rotor blades must also be consideredfrom an additional point of view, apart from considering the aeroelastic structural insta bilities. In the case of rotor blades which are adjusted about their longitudinal axis, i.e. in their pitch angle, attention must be paid not only to the torsion of the blade per se
