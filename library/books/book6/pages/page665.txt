Being equipped in this way, the system can operate completely autonomously in bothparallel and alternating modes of operation. When the wind turbines are operating with out the diesel generator, the grid frequency is held within an acceptable range by the rotors speed control. Decoupled from the diesel engine, the synchronous generator works as a rotating phase shifter and takes care of voltage control in the grid. The stor age battery, the capacity of which is designed for approximately 30 minutes of operation at rated power, can bridge short periods of low winds, thus avoiding excessively fre quent startups of the diesel generator. In addition, the backup battery can be used for smoothing out the load variations for the diesel engine, so that it can be kept within an advantageous operating range. Control of the overall system is handled by an overall load management system using the instantaneous grid frequency as reference variable.
