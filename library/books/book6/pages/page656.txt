Fig. 16.6. Computer simulation of a small Aeroman wind turbine heating a family home (floor area 140 m2), assumed location List on the island of Sylt, mean annual wind speed w  6.8 ms at 10 m height 10;Quite generally, the economics of using wind energy for heating purposes should beseen without illusion. Heating energy from a conventional gas or oil heating system currently in 2010 costs approximately 68 CentskWh in Europe. Roughly speaking, this is too little to be able to amortise a wind turbine within a sensible period of time. Even if wind turbines could be technically simplified for the special application of for resis tance heating, there would still be the additional costs of the conventional system. It is only if this equipment is already installed and could be shared that the investment costs can be kept within justifiable limits.;In nearly all cases this is only possible if the energy which is not used can be fed into the public grid. This, however, eliminates the possibility of introducing technical sim plifications into the wind turbine. Considering the present investment cost of a small wind turbine, which can fulfil these technical requirements, the utilization of wind en ergy for residential heating would be too expensive.;Due to these circumstances, heating with wind does not yet have an economicalchance even at the current oil or gas prices. Very small wind turbines which can be integrated into existing heating systems are most likely to be successful here, especially if the prices of oil and gas increase in the future.
