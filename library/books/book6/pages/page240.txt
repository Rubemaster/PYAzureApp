In wind turbines with induction generators, loading peaks can be smoothed out via the electrical slip of the generator (Fig. 6.34). However, large induction generators only have low slip values in their standard production models (Chapt. 9.1). It is only with a slip of at least 1 to 2  that the dynamic load level is reduced perceptibly and, at the same time, unwanted drive train vibrations are avoided.;Fig. 6.34. Smoothing of power and torque with an induction generator with a nominal slip of 0.5 and 5.5  18;True smoothing of the power captured by the rotor is only achieved by controlled variable speed operation of the rotor. The generator can be operated in variablespeed mode if a fre quency converter is connected (Chapt. 9.5). With this arrangement, the generator torque can be controlled to a constant value, independently of the speed, within a given speed range. The result is a complete smoothing out of the power transferred, and thus also of the loading, within the predetermined speed limits (Fig. 6.35).;The capability of a variable speed is, however, limited by the speed range implemented technically, so that larger fluctuations of wind speed cannot be compensated for. Effective smoothing of heavier wind gusts and their associated power and load peaks can only be achieved with the aid of blade pitch control. Rotor speed variability and blade pitch control should, therefore, always be considered together, as their effects
