The primary component of a wind turbine is the energy converter which transforms the kinetic energy contained in the moving air, into mechanical energy. For the initial discussions of principles, the exact nature of the energy converter is irrelevant. The extraction of mechanical energy from a stream of moving air with the help of a disk shaped, rotating wind energy converter follows its own basic rules. The credit for having applied this principle to windmills is owed to Albert Betz. Between 1922 and 1925, Betz published writings in which he was able to show that, by applying elementary physical laws, the mechanical energy extractable from an air stream passing through a given crosssectional area is restricted to a certain fixed proportion of the energy or power contained in the air stream 1. Moreover, he found that optimal power extraction could only be realised at a certain ratio between the flow velocity of air in front of the energy converter and the flow velocity behind the converter. Similar approaches have been made by Rankine and Froude on the example of ship propellers in the nineteenth century. Although Betzs momentum theory, which assumes an energy converter working without losses in a frictionless airflow, contains simplifications, its results are quite usable for performing rough calculations in practical engineering. But its true significance is founded in the fact that it provides a common physical basis for the understanding and operation of wind energy converters of various designs. For this reason, the following sections will provide a summarised mathematical derivation of the elementary momentum theory by Betz.
