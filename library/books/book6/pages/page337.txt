Fig. 9.15. Teetering hub frame with rotor blade root segments of Growian, 1982the fatigue strength of the hub could not be improved and it was this failed hub design which was the main reason for the short life of Growian.;Coupling the blade pitch angle to the teetering movement of the rotor can be realisedvery easily by tilting the teetering axis with respect to the rotor axis (3 coupling). For geometrical reasons, the teetering movement is in this case automatically associated with a change of the aerodynamic angle of attack of the blade, without the blade pitch angle having to be changed (Chapt. 6.6.2). The SwedishAmerican WTS34 experi mental turbines were equipped with such a teetering hub (Fig. 9.16).;This elegant solution is very simple, but has some disadvantages. The coupling factorbecomes dependent on the teetering amplitude and is no longer constant. Moreover, the choice of transmission ratio between hub teetering angle and the aerodynamic angle of attack of the blade depends on the geometry of the axis tilt. For low rotor speeds in the WTS3, hub teetering stabilisation was effected by means of a block on teetering up to approximately half the nominal speed, during the rotor startup and shutdown se quences.;The American MOD2 test turbines had simple teetering hubs without blade pitchcoupling. For the heavy allsteel rotor with little aerodynamic sensitivity, blade pitch coupling was obviously not considered effective enough. From the design point of view, the MOD2 teetering hub had a relatively simple structure (Fig. 9.17). The concept of a onepiece rotor core, and the blade pitch mechanism located in the blade tips completely removed the blade pitch mechanism from the hub, and thus provided the precondition for this very simple hub concept. The teetering bearing consisted of a rubberlike,
