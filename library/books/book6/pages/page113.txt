98 CHAPTER 5 ROTOR AERODYNAMICSof coupled partial differential equations which can be solved iteratively. In this context, it is of importance whether the flow state is laminar or turbulent. It is the selected turbulence model, in particular, which decides which flow effects can be dealt with. The CFD method enables not only the flow parameters (flow velocities, pressure, temperature etc.) to be calculated, but also the force distribution (loads) to be deter mined by means of appropriate integration methods. Unsteady flow processes can also be treated but only with a corresponding increase in computational complexity. In principle it must be said with respect to CFD that these elaborate methods are not a suitable instrument in the first face of the design process for finding the basic design. Their significance lies in the detailed analysis of complicated flow processes and in the possibility to visualize complex flow situations. The findings gained with this analysis can be used for achieving improvements and optimisations in the basic design. Develop ing and handling CFD methods is a matter for scientific institutes, as a rule. A variety of computer software is available in this field. In a European research program called VISCWIND, various methods are compared with one another and specially tailored for rotor aerodynamics 7. Figures 5.9 and 5.10 show two typical examples of the results of numeric flow simu lations. In the first example, the flow around the rotor hub in an Enercon wind turbine forms the prerequisite for the effectiveness of the special rotor blade shape at the blade root section (s. Fig. 5.38).
