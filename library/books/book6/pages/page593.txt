14.5 ANNUAL ENERGY YIELD 583optimum results with respect to energy yield. On the other hand, stallcontrolled turbines in most cases have a higher ratio of rated power to rotorswept area than turbines with blade pitch control so that the disadvantage of a nonoptimal rotor speed is somewhat counteracted again. Using a slight amount of caution, therefore, diagrams 14.28 and 14.29 can be applied to turbines with fixed blade pitch angle. The energy yield to be expected can be determined approximately via the annual equivalent hours at full load Figure 14.29 shows the usage time versus mean annual wind speed at hub height with
