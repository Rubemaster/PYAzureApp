5.5 ROTORDESIGN FEATURES AND POWER CHARACTERISTICS 135calculation methods described in the previous chapters 24. Several of the diagrams re produced in this chapter have been taken from this work. Though calculated for a certain blade configuration, the results can be applied in a generalized way to modern wind rotors.;The number of rotor blades is the most obvious characteristic of the rotor and is fre quently the object of divisive discussions. In the chapter on physical basics it has al ready been pointed out that it is possible to calculate the mechanical power which can be extracted from the wind power existing in a given air stream crosssection with rea sonable approximation without knowing the rotor configuration, i.e., without taking the number of rotor blades into consideration. This already indicates that the influence of the number of rotor blades on rotor power must be small. Put simply rotors with a lower number of blades rotate faster, thus almost compensating for their disadvantage of a smaller physical blade area.;Figure 5.45 shows the influence of the number of blades on the rotor power coefficient. The reduced increase in power coefficient with increasing numbers of rotor blades can be clearly seen. While the power increase from one to two blades is still a consider able 10 percent, the difference from two to three blades amounts to only three to four percent. The fourth blade only produces a power increase of one to two percent. In the ory, the power coefficient continues to increase with the number of blades. Rotors with a very large number of blades, e.g., the American wind turbine, however, exhibit a de creasing power coefficient. When rotor solidity is very high, the aerodynamic flow conditions become more complicated (cascade flow) and cannot be described by the theoretical model concepts explained.
