A change in rotor diameter has a considerable influence on the aerodynamically optimum rotor speed and it is, therefore, scarcely possible to change the rotor diameter without at the same time changing the rotor speed, i.e. the gear transmission ratio (Fig. 14.35).;Theoretically, the energy yield increases proportionally to the rotor swept area, i.e.;Theoretically, the energy yield increases proportionally to the rotor swept area, i.e.with the square of the rotor diameter, with an increase in diameter. But above the rated power, where the power output is limited by the control system, there is no increase in the energy yield. A significant gain in energy yield is only achieved with a simultaneous increase in rated generator power, that means to maintain the installed power per rotor swept area on the same level for example 450 Wm.;Figure 14.36 shows the real increase for the calculated example. It can be seen that in;Figure 14.36 shows the real increase for the calculated example. It can be seen that inthis case, a significant gain in energy yield is only achieved with a simultaneous in crease in the rated generator power and the appropriate rotor speed.;14.7.3 Optimal Rotor Speed and Variable Rotor Speed Operation;The significance of the selected rotor speed with respect to the energy output has already become apparent in the preceding discussions. The fact that the energetically optimal rotor speed is dependent on the wind regime should not lead to the conclusion that the rotor speed can thus be modified for any site. The technical complexity of such a modification, for example changing the gearbox, would be too high. Using the above example, Figure 14.37 shows the extent to which sites with different mean wind speeds influence the optimal rotor speed.
