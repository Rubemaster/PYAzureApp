However, he was quite aware of the fact that his findings would no longer have any practical consequences for windmill construction. For this reason, he quickly turned to the experiments described later (Chapt. 2.1), namely how to generate electrical current with the help of wind power. The second half of the 19th century also saw efforts of using new materials in windmill construction. Up to this point, windmills had almost exclusively been built from wood (Fig. 1.14). Above all, the windshaft, which had to bear high loads, was made of cast iron (Fig. 1.15). It quickly turned out, however, that the traditional oakwood windshaft was able to sustain such loads at least as well due to its better material damping properties and higher fatigue strength. After the aerodynamicist Albert Betz had formulated the modern physical principles of windenergy conversion in 1920 and, moreover, modern airfoil designs had been developed in aircraft engineering, Major Kurt Bilau applied this knowledge to the design of windmills.;The Ventikanten sail developed by him in cooperation with Betz was formed ofaluminium sheets, like an aircraft airfoil, and had an adjustable auxiliary flap which permitted power and speed regulation of the windmill (Figs. 1.16 and 1.17).
