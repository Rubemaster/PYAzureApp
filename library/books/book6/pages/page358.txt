9.6.4 Rotor Shaft Integrated into the Gearbox;An even larger step towards a more compact design is supporting the rotor directly at the gearbox. This solution was implemented in some small and mediumsized wind turbines. The disadvantage is that the gearbox with flanged or totally integrated rotor bearings can no longer be adopted from other fields of application as a universal gearbox but must be specially designed for the wind turbine (Fig. 9.36).;The unavoidable deformations of the loadbearing housing and the bending of the rotor shaft must not affect the operation of the gear mechanism. Sticking cogwheels or axial displacements of the cogwheels and bearings which promote wear must be avoided. Gearbox manufacturers offer such gearboxes in series production for smaller to mediumsized turbines.;In this concept, the supporting bedplate of the nacelle becomes very small. Some turbines do without a supporting bedplate entirely. Like the rotor, the electric generator and all secondary units are flanged to the gearbox. The gearbox housing, connected directly to the tower, completely assumes the role of the loadbearing nacelle structure.;Regardless of these basic advantages, this design is no longer widely used in morerecent turbines. The threepoint suspension of rotor and gearbox, for example, is less susceptible to failure and more easily repaired, if necessary.
