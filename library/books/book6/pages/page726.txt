17.3 OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY IN THE NORTH SEA AND IN THE BALTIC SEA 717nearby. It is implemented in HVDCT Light technology. Furthermore there is a need for more high voltage transmission lines in the inland transferring the energy from the North Sea coast to the south. This is particular important since the German government has de cided to shut down all nuclear power plant up to 2022. Large offshore wind parks are a key element in the Energiewende, that means the shift to use of renewable energies.;The European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) has analyzed the near future development of the offshore wind parks in the EU 21. Besides the operational wind parks and the wind parks under construction they counted all consented projects. These are projects on which the authorities and the applicants for the building permissions have agreed upon. The capacity identified is presently (2011) about 16000 MW (Fig. 17.36). In this scenario the largest share would be shifted to Germany (provided that sufficient transmission lines will be available  the author).;The real development in the next five or ten years probably will be different from theabove scenario described by EWEA. In countries like UK, Sweden or Netherlands more project will appear as in the category consented identified by EWEA. This means, that the total number and the shares maybe different as shown in Figure 17.36.;Whatever the capacity achievable in ten or twenty years is estimated to be one thingis clear in any case The offshore wind park potential represents an important option from the point of view of energy economics. The capacity which can be achieved will at any rate be sufficient not only for supplementing the traditional energy sources but also for replacing them in future.
