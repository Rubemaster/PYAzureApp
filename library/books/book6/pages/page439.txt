The fact that there are different electrotechnical concepts for wind turbines calls for a comparison. For several reasons, however, a quantitative comparison is not simple. For one, the advantages and disadvantages of the electrical concepts can only be assessed within the framework of the overall wind turbine and its applications. Moreover, a com plex electrical concept may indeed lead to a cheaper overall solution, if it is associated with advantages on the mechanical or operational side. Regardless of these difficulties and at the risk of being justifiably contradicted, some basic data are compiled in Table 10.41 in the sense of a comparative overview. However, the problems involved in such a compa parison require some explanatory remarks;Table 10.41.
