Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The power coefficients measured confirmed the theoretical calculations and were lower than in comparable horizontal axis rotors (Fig. 5.66). However, in recent years it has been possible to experimentally prove cPR values of over 0.40 30.;One variant of the Darrieus rotor, the socalled Hrotor, in theory, attains higherpower coefficients, as its blade cross sections are all equidistant from the axis of rota tion (Chapt. 3.1). It has not been possible to achieve this theoretically higher power coefficient in existing turbines. The mountings and struts of the rotor blades caused considerable aerodynamic drag, thus considerably reducing performance in practice.;The aerodynamic characteristics of verticalaxis rotors exhibit one essential difference compared to horizontalaxis rotors. The optimum power coefficient is achieved at relatively low tipspeed ratios. Due to the high drag components of the rotor blades in certain sections of their revolution, i.e. the poor lift to drag ratio, the optimum point of the power coefficient is shifted towards lower tipspeed ratios (Chapt. 5.5.4, Fig. 5.46).
