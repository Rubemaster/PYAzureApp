5.9 EXPERIMENTAL ROTOR AERODYNAMICS 161unsteady flow conditions. Power measurements do not require that the model is elasto mechanically accurate and, moreover, can be carried out with steadystate flow condi tions. The only condition to guarantee validity for the original is that a certain minimum value of Reynolds number be maintained. According to F. X. Wortmann, these types of measurement can be carried out with reasonable accuracy if, at the same blade tip speed, the model scale is selected such that the Reynolds number, referred to the chord length, is at least 2 x 105 33. E.g., for a rotor with a diameter of 100 m, this means a model diameter of approx. 4 m. Using a model of this size, rotor power measurements for the former German experimental Growian wind turbine were carried out in the lowspeed wind tunnel of the German Aerospace Research Institute (Deutsche Forschungs und Versuchsanstalt fr Luft und Raumfahrt, DLR) in Gttingen, Germany (Fig. 5.68) 34. The power coefficients measured were reasonably consistent with the calculated theo retical values (Fig. 5.69). Similar measurements on models in the wind tunnel were carried out during the development of the American MOD2 and WTS4 turbines. Simulating the dynamic response of wind rotors for unsteady flow conditions re quires special equipment, both for the model and the wind tunnel. At the Fluid Dynam ics Institute of the University of Stuttgart, Germany, F. X. Wortmann built a special gust wind tunnel with the aid of which both power measurements and the dynamic response of the rotor to predetermined gusts were to be experimentally determined. In this gust wind tunnel research work has been carried out on various singlebladed con figurations in the eighties (Fig. 5.70).
