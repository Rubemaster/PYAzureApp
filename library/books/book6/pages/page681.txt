European Union. There are no statistics about the worldwide employment in this field, mainly due to the lack of data from Asia.;16.5.3 Components Industry, Service Providers and Basic Research;The wind turbine industry represents largely an interplay of wind turbine manufacturers and subcontractors. Many small companies are neither capable of raising the money for the ever increasing development costs for new turbines completely by themselves, nor do they have the corresponding development and production capacities in order to be able to manufacture all the essential components by themselves. For many wind tur bines, the percentage of the value of the subcontracted components is about 50  on average in wind turbines and even much more in some types so that the creation of value is comparatively low for the turbine manufacturers. The subcontractors develop many key components at their own costs and risk and are thus carrying a considerable share of the total development costs in the wind turbine industry.;The rotor blades are the key component in a wind turbine. The increase of the wind turbine size is driven  or limited  mainly by the availability of rotor blades of the appropriate size. Almost one half of the rotor blades are being developed and produced by manufacturerindependent subcontractor companies.
