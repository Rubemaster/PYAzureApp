698 CHAPTER 17 OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY UTILISATIONproblem for the operator of the wind farm. This case is a main issue to discuss with the insurance company. Private investors are not able to bear the risk of an offshore invest ment without procuring insurance for the loss of income.;For all the commercial offshore projects, the most varied concepts have been developed in order to ensure that the turbines can be reached. The current docking technique is that the supply boat presses against the tower of the wind turbine and the service person has to catch the ladder at the tower (Fig. 17.21). A number of other techniques have been investigated, for example a dynamically controlled platform, with which a safe transfer to the tower even in a rough swell would be possible. There are even ideas for using submarine vessels by means of which the maintenance personnel can enter the tower under water in diving suits.;Also a certain accessibility from the air is considered to be appropriate. Some largeoffshore wind turbines have special platforms on their nacelle, with the aid of which persons and material can be delivered by helicopter (Fig. 17.22). However, this ap proach can only be used for performing smaller maintenance work and small repairs. Apart from this accessibility by helicopter is not possible at very bad weather condi tions.;The risk of nonaccessability is particularly during the winter months, unfortunatelythe time with high average wind speeds and thus with high revenue generation. In order to assess the financial risk simulation models have been developed considering the weather statistics and the available access techniques. Also limited practicable experi ences are available, particularly in the UK. The results indicate that an offshore wind
