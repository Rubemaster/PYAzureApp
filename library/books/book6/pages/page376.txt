In the recent years the idea of speedvariable mechanical transmission systems hasbeen picked up again by some wind turbine and gearbox manufactures. The aim is to use a standard synchronous generator with variable speed operation without an electric frequency inverter.;A prototype of an electric driven transmission system has been developed by asmaller Austrian company 18. The socalled differential system consists of a control drive with a differential gearbox. It can be combined with the main gearbox of the wind turbine and a mediumvoltage synchronous generator. The weight of the components (electrical control motor with inverter and differential gearbox) is between 2 to 2.5 tons.;A system based on a hydrodynamic converter has been developed by the German Voithcompany and is offered as a commercial product (Fig. 9.53). As is usual, the gearbox is based on a planetary gearing arrangement which is coupled here with an hydrodynamic converter acting as control unit and additionally also as damper. Combining it with an hydrodynamic converter has the special advantage that the dynamic load peaks are smoothed not only by the variability in speed but also in the converter itself. This is said to make the variablespeed gearbox superior to the generator plus frequency inverter combi nation. The weight of the drive train should also be much lower. Since only about 3 of the power is flowing via the hydrodynamic converter, the efficiency of the gearbox re mains good. This gearbox offered by the name of WinDrive, combined with a synchro nous generator, is compared by Voith with the electrical alternative of a generator with inverter. The combination of generator with mechanical powersplitting gearbox is said to be more advantageous both with regard to weight and to installed size 19.
