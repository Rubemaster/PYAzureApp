The inplane bearing can be integrated into the front wall of the nacelle as was done in some older, smaller systems. However, compact and stiff cast bodies which virtually replace the loadbearing nacelle bedplate are preferred for larger turbines. In the Vestas V90, the rotor bearing assembly is constructed as a cast shell enclosing the gearbox, in such a manner, that the flangedon gearbox can be dismantled without losing the rotor support. This type of load bearing element, which is also directly mounted on the yaw bearing, is the most compact lightest type of construction according to the state of the art. Nevertheless Vestas returned to more conventional bearing concepts particularly to the classic solution of two separate bearings (Vestas V112). Obviously it is considered as more reliable and easier to handle. The disadvantage with regard to the weight seems to be not so important for the latest designs.;9.6.6 Rotor Support on a Fixed Axle;The high alternating bending loads in the rotor shaft can only be absorbed by an expen sive and heavy component. A concept which can be found in some of the more recent turbines tries to avoid this disadvantage. Here, the rotor is supported on a fixed shaft support which is not subjected to alternating bending loads, but only to a static bending load. This fixed shaft is designed as a cast element connected directly to the tower flange, supporting the entire drive train.;The approach of a fixed axle support is particularly well suited for gearless drivetrain designs since these do not require a torque to be transmitted from the rotor via the gearbox to the electric generator. The gearless systems by Enercon, Lagerwey and oth ers, therefore, have a cast bearing shaft which supports the rotor and the directdriven generator (Fig. 9.39).
