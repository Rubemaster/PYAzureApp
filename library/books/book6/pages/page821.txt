19.2.7 Lowering Costs through Further Technical Development;Wind turbines of current design have by no means reached the final stage in their techni cal development. How could a complex system, which has been the object of systematic research and development work for not even twenty years, have reached the limit of its potential for development? The existing potential for development will be utilised not only for increasing the efficiency and service life of wind turbines, but also for a further reduction of their manufacturing costs. In small and mediumsized wind turbines, the potential for further development with respect to reducing the manufacturing costs ap pears to be relatively limited. However, it is noticeable that the price minimum of about 300 US per square meter rotorswept area is shifting towards ever larger wind turbines whilst at the same time rising only slightly. In the mideighties, only the Danish turbines with about 15 m rotor diameter and 50 to 60 kW rated power achieved this value. Only three years later, wind turbines with 20 m rotor diameter and about 150 kW were already available at these specific prices. At present, wind turbines of up to 3,000 kW are pro duced in series at an only slightly higher price level.;The main reason for this development has been the consistent continued weight optimisation of the components within the past fifteen years (Chapt. 19.1.2). It was possible to reduce the weight of the rotor blades considerably by means of improved compositefibre designs, which also created the preconditions for the weight optimisa tion of the subsequent components. Another step, already implemented in recent years, was the transition from distributed, large and heavy drive train designs to compact
