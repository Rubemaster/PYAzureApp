In larger wind turbines, the planetary design definitely prevails. For outputs of several megawatts, two or threestage models are used (Fig. 9.45). Large gearboxes of this type are used, for example, in shipbuilding and several other fields of mechanical engi neering, so that suitable gearboxes for large wind turbines can be derived from these production sources.;Fig. 9.43. Overall mass and relative cost of different gearbox designs 10 Example Rated power of the wind turbine 2500 kW, rotor speed 25 r.p.m., generator speed 1500 r.p.m., gearbox service factor 1.6
