The connecting point C is defined as the point in the public utility grid at which power is fed in. Small wind parks are almost always connected to the mediumvoltage power system, usually at 15 to 30 kV. Wherever possible, this is the most costeffective solu tion (Fig. 18.11). On the one hand, switchgear and transformers are much more inex pensive than those for highvoltage use and, on the other hand, the distances up to the grid infeed point are generally limited to a few kilometres in industrialised countries.;Fig. 18.11. Grid connection to a 20 kV mediumvoltage grid with mastmounted circuit breakers Large wind parks with total power outputs of more than 20 MW can no longer beconnected to the mediumvoltage system. The power system stability at medium voltage level does not allow such powers to be injected from a point source, given the specific characteristics of wind power generation. For this reason alone, there is no other choice but to install the more expensive connection to the highvoltage power
