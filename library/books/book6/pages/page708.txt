17.2 OPERATIONAL ISSUES OF OFFSHORE WIND TURBINES 699park in the open sea could not be reached between 20 to 30 of the year, at least with the present access systems. The objective is to increase the access up to 90 of the year.;Due to the fact that the logistical methods for supplying offshore wind turbines have not yet become established in a commercial scale it is almost impossible to calculate the financial outlay for servicing and maintenance to a reliable degree. Although there are first experimental values, their informative value is very low with regard to decades of operation. They have been determined under similar conditions, as the operating costs of the first large experimental test installations at the beginning of the nineteennineties (s.a. Chapt. 2.6).;All the numerical values published about the costs for servicing and maintenance are,therefore, valid only under the current conditions. In many cases they are still hiding de velopment costs included later for embryonic systems or improvised, and thus expensive, procedures. The expenditure for servicing and maintenance will be higher than on land in every case. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the operating costs will be higher by at least 33 to 50  than on land. In addition, the calculations include a lesser technical availability of the turbines. Instead of the availability of 98  achieved today by turbines sited on land, a distinctly lower availability of about 92  is expected 13.
