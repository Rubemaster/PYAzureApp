The two new wind turbine concepts were presented to the general public at the World Exhibition in 1876 in Philadelphia. Farmers were highly interested in this relatively simple and cheap piece of equipment. In the following years, wind turbines were manufactured in ever greater numbers by an ever increasing number of relatively small firms, especially the model developed by Wheeler, which was built in numerous variants. By 1899, as many as 77 windmill factories were counted. By 1930 their number had increased to almost 100 companies with a total of about 2300 employees 4. Wind turbines also became a lucrative export article and were sold almost worldwide. However, they were no longer able to establish a foothold in Europe, as wind power utilisation was too much on the retreat there by that time. Some German firms like Herkules or Kster nevertheless manufactured wind turbines under license in modest numbers. By 1930, more than six million American wind turbines had been manufactured. For the first time ever, the utilisation of wind energy was based on an industrially mass produced article. A remarkable fact, and it can hardly be considered a coincidence that it was in the USA where it happened for the first time. However, the Rural Electrification Programme of the thirties which provided electrification to the rural areas put paid to wind turbines also in the New World and their numbers dwindled rapidly. The remaining stock is estimated to be about 150 000 units in the USA today. In recent years, several manufacturers have resumed production, so that possibly their numbers are on the rise again.;1.
