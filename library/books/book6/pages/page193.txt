6.3.4 Cross Wind on the Rotor;A similar asymmetry of rotor cross wind as that due to the increase in wind speed with height is produced by the cross wind on the rotor as a consequence of rapid changes in the wind direction. The relatively inert yaw drive can follow these only with a consider able time delay so that the incident airflow exhibits a yaw angle with respect to the rotor axis at times. In addition, asymmetric inflow conditions for the rotor can be caused by diverted wind streams in the case of topographically complex terrain or also due to the rotor design in the case of an inclined rotor axis. This is another reason for keeping the rotor axis inclination as small as possible although it is required with very flexible rotor blades in order to guarantee that sufficient free space is maintained between the blade tips and the tower when maximum deflection occurs.;The mathematical treatment of the rotor in a cross wind with respect to the aerodynamic forces is not simple. Some useful approaches in this respect are provided by the blade element theory but these remain valid only up to certain yaw angles. Some possi bilities which are better in part are given with the vortex model of the rotor 4. Figure 6.8 shows the result of a measurement on an experimental installation of the Dutch ECN Institute. The authors point out that the agreement with the mathematical results is still acceptable at a yaw angle of up to 200 whilst the measured effect is clearly underesti mated by the theory at an angle of 300.
