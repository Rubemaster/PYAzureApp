Moreover, the power coefficient now becomes dependent on the ratio between theenergy components from the rotating motion and the translatorial motion of the air stream. This ratio is determined by the tangential velocity of the rotor blades in relation to the undisturbed axial airflow, the wind velocity and is called the tip speed ratio , commonly referenced to the tangential velocity of the rotor blade tip.;A fundamental element of the power characteristics of a rotor is that the power coeffi cient is a function of the tip speed ratio, as it is for any other turbinelike prime mover or machine. In conventional turbine engineering and in propeller theory, the tip speed ratio is called coefficient of advance which, however, is defined reciprocally.;The decisive step from an essentially physical approach to technical rotor aerodynamics is taken by introducing rotor blade geometry. It is the only means to finding the interrelationship between the actual shape of the rotor and its aerodynamic properties. A method commonly used to this end in wind energy technology is called the blade ele ment or strip theory 4.;In this theory (strip theory), the upwind conditions and aerodynamic forces acting onblade elements rotating at a distance r from the rotor axis are determined. To simplify mat ters, it is assumed that the aerodynamic forces, moving in concentric strips (strip theory), do not interfere with one another (Fig. 5.3). The blade element is formed by the local rotor blade chord (aerodynamic airfoil) and the radial extent of the element dr. The airfoil chord section at radius r is set at a local blade pitch angle  with respect to the rotor plane of rotation (Fig. 5.4). The axial free stream velocity a in the rotor plane and the tangential speed u at the radius of the blade crosssection combine to form a resultant flow velocity , Together with the airfoil chord line, it forms the local aerodynamic angle of attack.
