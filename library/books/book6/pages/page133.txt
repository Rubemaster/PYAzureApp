118 CHAPTER 5 ROTOR AERODYNAMICSfaults in the aerodynamic design or also as a consequence of the before mentioned flow effects which were not covered by the mathematical models used. A mixing up of the boundary layer flow and thus a flow which remains longer at tached can be achieved in a simple way by means of perturbation bodies which are installed in the front area of the top of the airfoil. These are small plates mounted at an angle to the direction of flow and often also at an angle to one another in order to en hance the generation of vortices in a particular way  socalled vortex generators (Fig. 5.30). Vortex generators are occasionally also used on aircraft wings in order to hold the flow longer in the area of the ailerons. Using such vortex generators, stalling can be shifted towards higher angles of attack, particularly on thicker airfoils as can be found in the inner area of the blade. However, the perturbation bodies produce increased drag when the surrounding flow is adhering. It is, therefore, a matter of carefully considering whether the positive effect of delaying the stall in the inner area of the rotor is not balanced, or even overcompensated, by the power losses in other operating conditions above a certain wind velocity. Installing vortex generators has been quite successful in some cases. Thus it was possible to im prove the poor flow conditions in the area of the adjustable outer rotor blades on the rotors of the experimental MOD2 turbine (s. Chapt. 5.3.1). Investigations on Darrieus rotors have shown that here, too, premature stalling in the blade areas close to the axle was delayed, resulting in a noticeable improvement to the power curve 17.
