20.2 POWER PRODUCTION COSTS AND REPAYMENT PERIODS 855sorts of failures and improvements on the wind turbines. In addition, the organisational and logistical structures for the technical service are still largely improvised and, there fore, not representative with regard to the costs. Regardless of these reservations, the annual operating costs for the future offshore wind parks planned are estimated to be higher by about 30  than those for onshore installations (s.a. Chapt. 19.5.2).;Table 20.5 shows a sample calculation for a proposed wind park in the coastal offshore area of the Baltic Sea (s.a. Chapt.19, Table 19.25). In the example, the technical availability of the turbines was assumed to be less than on land with 95  and the total operating costs to be 6  of the technical investment costs. Moreover, the operating costs are not referred to the exworks price of the wind turbines as in the case of on shore erection but to the total investment costs. This reference appears to be more realis tic since the residual investments represent almost one half of the total investments. The wind velocity was applied as having a value of 9.0 ms at a rotor hub height of 80 m in the coastal area.;Table 20.5. Power generation costs of a projected 300 MW wind park in the Baltic Sea (100 wind turbines of 3MW each, distance from the coast 30 km, water depth 1520 m);Annual Costs  Maintenance and repairs, insurance, land lease  (8.3  of investment costs, 4.5  of wind turbine costs)  Service of capital (6  interest rate p.a., 20 years Annuity 8.72 ;The resultant power generation costs of about 12 centskWh with a repayment periodof 20 years are clearly higher than on land. Given these assumptions, the higher invest ment and operating costs in comparison with onshore siting cannot be cancelled by the higher wind velocity or energy yield.
