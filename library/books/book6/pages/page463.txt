It has been attempted in some turbines to control the rotor power solely by means ofrotor speed, i.e. via the generator torque of a variable speed generator system, but the aerodynamically captured rotor power can only be regulated by this means within a much narrower range than is possible with pitch angle control. In principle, this method is an option for rotors without blade pitch adjustment. Present experience has shown that a practical implementation with respect to stable control characteristics encounters considerable problems. It is not really possible to achieve satisfactory power limiting by means of aerodynamic stall with a variable rotor speed.;The control issues of wind turbines in isolated operation without a stable electric grid are not yet developed to a mature status. As outlined in Chapter 16.1 there are only more or less experimental installations on the basis of small wind turbines. The enor mous success of large gridconnected turbines has focussed the technical progress on this kind of application. The control of small wind turbines in isolated operation there fore can be only discussed from a basic point of view.
