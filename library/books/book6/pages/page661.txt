Some more test installations have been built by Enercon since the midnineties. On theislands of Tenerife (Spain), Syros and Chios (Greece) and in India some (reverse osmo sis) plants are being tested. Enercon has announced that they are offering a modular concept ready for series production. The plants are intended to be suitable for private consumers as well as for industrial applications or hotels etc.;A small test plant was taken into operation in 1984 on the German North Sea islandof Sderoog. Based on the experience of the test plant on Sderoog, more evolved con cepts with higher performance were developed (Fig. 16.10). In the concept shown, the power consumption of the ROplant is matched to the wind turbine by switching the
