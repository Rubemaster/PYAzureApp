9.6.3 ThreePoint Suspension of Rotor Shaft and Gearbox;A bearing assembly which has been used successfully more recently in large turbines is one in which the rear bearing is integrated into the gearbox. In this configuration, the rotor shaft and the gearbox are supported at three points the front rotor bearing and the two side support bearings of the gearbox, which is why this design is called a three point suspension (Figs. 9.34 and 9.35). The advantage is that the distance between the bearings becomes shorter and thus also the rotor shaft and the bedplate. Moreover, the rotor shaft with bearing and gearbox assembly can be preassembled and installed jointly which facilitates an efficient assembly of the nacelle also in this case.;On the other hand, the gearbox has to absorb not only the torque but also the bendingmoments of the rotor shaft in this design, too. Furthermore, the gearbox can no longer be dismantled without any complications and the rotor shaft must then be held by an elaborate bearing harness.
