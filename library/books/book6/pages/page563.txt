The numerical evaluation provides the energy yield for a certain rotor speed. The calcu lation must be carried out for a number of assumed rotor speeds. The graphical plot of the results versus the rotor speed shows the maximum energy yield and the correspond ing optimum rotor speed (Fig. 14.3). The determination of the optimal rotor speed, 14.5 rpm in the example shown, makes it possible to determine the corresponding character istic. This establishes the power curve of the wind turbine for the design wind data used as a basis.;The flow chart below provides an overview of the entire mathematical process withthe required parameters and interconnections (Fig. 14.4). The many interdependencies and variables influencing the energy yield of a wind turbine become clear again. Natu rally, these relationships are primarily of importance to the designer of a wind turbine who is involved in all the details of the design and calculation processes.;The process is simpler for the operator of the turbine who has nothing to do with theoptimisation methods described here but bases his decisions on the established power curve of the turbine, combining this with the expected wind data of the intended site and thus obtaining the energy yield to be expected from the turbine. The required  not very complex  calculation procedure will be explained in Chapter 14.5. It belongs to the basic techniques of the planning in windpower project.
