4.1 BETZS ELEMENTARY MOMENTUM THEORY 83  before and after the converter. If this interrelationship is plotted graphically  naturally, an analytical solution can also be found easily  it can be seen that the power coefficient reaches a maximum at a certain velocity ratio (Fig. 4.2).;Fig. 4.3 shows the flow conditions through the wind energy converter once again, in greater detail. In addition to the flow lines, the variations of the associated flow velocity and of the static pressure are indicated. When approaching the converter plane the air is
