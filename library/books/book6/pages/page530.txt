  1     where   distribution function e  logarithmic base (normally the natural log, e  2.781) A  scaling factor k  shape parameter If nothing besides from the mean wind velocity is known and a usual frequency dis tribution can be assumed, this is characterised by a form factor of k  2. In this special case, the Weibull distribution is called a Rayleigh distribution. The relative frequency is obtained mathematically from the cumulative frequency by differentiating with respect to the wind speed W. On real sites the shape parameter k varies from about 1.5 to 2.5. A value around 1.5 is typical for offshore sites or on small islands. Over land the factor reaches values up to 2.5 or somewhat above on very specific sites. The annual energy yield of a wind turbine will be influenced by some percent (s. Chapt. 15.2). Furthermore it has to be considered, that the shape factor depends on the increasing mean wind speed with height.
