5.4 THE AERODYNAMIC AIRFOIL 131socalled standard roughness defined in accordance with a particular peaktovalley height is used 20. From a practical point of view, the problem is to interpret real surface roughnesses in terms of these idealized conditions. This requires a great deal of experience. Maintaining the airfoil geometry is also of particular importance with laminar airfoils. This applies to the nose radius, for example, or the corrugation of the surface.;The experience of recent years has shown that many mistakes were made in this areaand are the cause of the disappointing performance characteristics of many wind tur bines. Quite obviously, some rotor blade manufacturers were lacking in aviation experi ence in handling the production of rotorblades with laminar airfoils. However, there has been some rethinking in recent years. The wind turbine manufacturers have increasingly recognized the significance of airfoil aerodynamics for the performance of a wind tur bine installation. The production technology, too, has been improved with regard to the requirements of laminar airfoils for the surface finish of the rotor blades.;Rough surfaces can also be caused by contamination occurring in operation. Similarto gliders, the dirt consists of a mixture of insects and firmly bakedon dust. In large rotors with hubs at over 80 m height, performancereducing soiling of the rotor blades is found only to a small extent. The problem is much more severe with smaller turbines (Fig. 5.42).
