from there into a storage tank. The remaining, more concentrated salt solution is drained from the cell.;The energy requirement (all that is needed is the mechanical or electrical energy fordriving the pumps) increases with the salt concentration of the available sea water. For this reason, this method is to date predominantly being used for desalinating sea water with a low salt content (brackish water). With modern membranes, however, drinking water with a residual salt content of 0.5 gkg can be produced even with sea water with a salt content of 35 g salt per kg water (North Sea). The energy demand for this salt concentration amounts to 10 to 15 kWh of electrical energy for the desalination of one cubic meter of salt water. However, the reverse osmosis method requires extensive pre conditioning of the sea water. Suspended organic particles and various minerals must be filtered out to prevent premature clogging of the membranes.;Reverse osmosis provides favourable conditions for being operated in combinationwith a wind turbine, as the energy required for driving the pumps is electrical energy. Moreover, water desalination has the general advantage of all water treatment and sup ply methods, namely that of simple storage methods for water. Continuous production with constant volume is not mandatory. Utilising wind energy for desalinating sea water by means of reverse osmosis is, therefore, considered to be a promising application. A series of small test plants has already been built and plans for larger installations are about to be implemented.;A type of sea water desalination based on a special distillation process, the socalledsteam compression, has been tried out for some time on the island of Rgen in the Baltic Sea 13. The plant is driven by a relatively old 300kW wind turbine and the process appears to have been successful so that more installations are planned in the Mediterranean area (Fig. 16.9).
