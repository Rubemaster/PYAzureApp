In many wind turbines, particularly in smaller ones, the aerodynamic noise is drowned out by mechanical noise sources. Since mechanical noise, in contrast to aerodynamic noise, can be avoided or heavily damped, it must be considered as an indication of poor design. However, avoiding mechanical noise does require a certain amount of care and possibly additional expenses for soundproofing or insulation material for solidborne noise.;The first priority is to pay attention to the noise emission of the gearbox. There are nosilent gearboxes in practice (Chapt. 8.8.2). The sound propagated through the air must, therefore, be intercepted by appropriate sound insulation of the nacelle. Generally, this does not pose any problems. It is much more difficult to prevent noise propagation through solid bodies. For structural reasons, the gearbox must be firmly connected to the supporting nacelle structure which, in turn, must be firmly joined to the tower. Noise is thus transferred to these structures and there may be considerable resonance amplifi cation of the emitted sound. A hollow steel tower or the steel walls of the nacelle are just about the ideal resonating bodies.
