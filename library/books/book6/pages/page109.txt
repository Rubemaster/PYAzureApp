94 CHAPTER 5 ROTOR AERODYNAMICSthe rotor  the tangential force distribution, and one at right angles to it  the thrust dis tribution (Fig. 5.5). Integrating the tangential force distribution over the rotor radius provides the driving torque of the rotor and, with the rotational speed of the rotor, the rotor power or power coefficient, respectively. Integrating the thrust distribution yields the total rotor thrust for instance to the tower. The blade element or strip theory thus provides both the rotor power and the steadystate aerodynamic loading for a given blade geometry.;Taking the rotor power characteristic, i.e. the variation of the power coefficient as a;Taking the rotor power characteristic, i.e. the variation of the power coefficient as afunction of the tip speed ratio, as an example, the approximation of the theoretical mod els to reality can be illustrated retrospectively (Fig. 5.6). Referred to the power rating of the air stream, the simple momentum theory by Betz provides the ideal constant power coefficient of 0.593 which is independent of the tip speed ratio. Taking into considera tion the angular momentum in the rotor wake shows that the power coefficient becomes a function of the tip speed ratio. It is only when the tip speed ratios become infinitely
