The electrical system of a wind turbine includes all components for converting me chanical energy into electric power as well as the electrical auxiliaries and the entire control and supervisory system. Next to the mechanical drive train, the electrical system thus constitutes the second essential subsystem in a wind turbine.;In a wind turbine, the actual mechanicalelectrical energy converter, the generator, asin a conventional power plant, is the focal point for all the preceding components in the functional chain (Fig. 10.1). Its characteristic properties are all the more important for a wind turbine as the rotor as prime mover with its unsteady torque causes the most varied problems.;In principle, a wind turbine for electric power generation can be equipped with anytype of generator. The demand for gridcompatible electric current can be met today by connecting downstream inverters, even if the generator supplies alternating current of variable quality, or direct current.;Generators producing direct current have the advantage of being operable at variablespeed. High power direct current generators are, however, no longer in common use today. Several other reasons such as a highmaintenance commutator and their compara tively high cost also speak against them. Very small wind turbines which are merely used for recharging batteries and are, therefore, only intended for generating direct current, are still in use today, of course. They are, however, unsuitable for larger wind turbines.
