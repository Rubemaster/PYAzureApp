854 CHAPTER 20 WIND TURBINE ECONOMICSmeans of the payment for feeding electricity into an interconnected system, can achieve an economically acceptable situation at a mean annual wind speed of above 6.0 ms at rotor hub height. For large wind turbines with rotor hub heights of 80 m and more, this means that regions with mean wind speeds above about 4.0 ms measured at 10 m height can be used economically.;Fig. 20.4. Power generation costs for the wind park of Table 20.3 as a function of the mean an nual wind velocity at rotor hub height (80 m) and at 10 m height (increase in wind speed with height according to log. formula with z0  0.1 m);The economic viability of offshore siting of wind turbines will firstly be judged by whether it can stand a comparison with a land site. On the one hand, there are higher investment costs and greater expenditure for maintenance and repairs and on the other hand there is the increased energy yield due to the higher wind velocities.;The investment and operating costs, and thus the profitability of the offshore erectionof wind turbines, are a question of siting, far more than on land. The decisive criteria are the depth of the water and the distance from the coast. The range of offshore projects planned today can be illustrated in model form with two exemplary calculations.;In the coastal area, in regions where the offshore wind parks implemented to thepresent day are located, the water depth rarely exceeds more than 20 m. The distances from the coast are within a range of 10 to 30 km. Given these prerequisites, the first experiences are available which can be used for determining the investment costs with relatively good accuracy. The longterm development of the operating costs is much more uncertain. None of the projects completed to the present supply any reliable data in this respect. In most cases, the first years of operation were still characterized by all
