11.4 POWER CONTROL WITH ROTOR BLADE PITCHING 439generator the voltage and reactive power of which can be influenced via the field exci tation (action C). Thus, there are three types of control action available to regulate the overall system.;When looking at a wind turbine, it immediately becomes apparent that the first control action, the dosing of the primary energy source, is absent. The wind turbine must cope with the random variations of the primary energy source wind. The primary energy conversion of the rotor can be controlled only by pitching the blades. This con trol action can be most easily compared with the steam inlet of the turbine. If an appro priate electrical system is used, the generator torque and reactive power can also be controlled in a wind turbine. The main problem with wind turbine control is the fluctu ating supply of primary energy. These fluctuations are of greater or lesser significance to the control characteristics depending on the time intervals over which they are effec tive.;Due to the mass inertia of the rotor blades and actuating elements, extremely brieffluctuations (wind turbulence and gusts) of less than a second cannot be responded to by the blade pitch control. As the control system cannot respond within these periods of time, the resultant loads must be borne by the turbine and the ensuing power fluctua tions accepted.;Changes in wind speed within a range of severalseconds can be responded to bythe control system. This is where the real task of the control system lies. The control
