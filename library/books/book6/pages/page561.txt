14.1 FROM ROTOR POWER CHARACTERISTICS TO TURBINE POWER CURVE 551wind frequency distribution has its maximum. It is only then that the energy yield will reach its highest value. However, the position of the maximum energy density of a wind frequency distribution is not identical with the maximum of the wind speed distribution but is located near higher wind speeds (Fig. 14.1).;Since the aim is to maximise the energy yield, the optimum rotor speed can only befound by simultaneously calculating the energy yield. For this purpose, a certain fre quency distribution of the wind speeds to be expected, the socalled design wind data, must be specified. The wind speed at the peak of the energy density distribution becomes the design wind speed vD. In addition, the choice of cutout wind speed, i.e. the wind speed at which power generation should stop, has a certain effect even if only a small one. Using a generator with direct grid coupling means that the rotor speed has to be constant so that the optimum rotor speed is a particularly important factor in this case. But the limited speed range must also be specified with regard to maximising the energy yield for a variablespeed turbine.;In theory, the rotor speed should be optimised for each site with a different windspeed distribution. Since the dependence of the optimum rotor speed on the usual wind speed frequency distributions is not very serious and the rotor speed cannot be changed for every site for technical reasons, the optimisation is done for the design wind data. These, however, must be selected carefully, having regard to the intended range of use of the wind turbine. The optimum rotor speed and the energy yield are calculated simul taneously as follows For a selected rotor speed, a certain rotor power cPRcurve versus wind speed can be determined from the rotor power chart (Fig. 14.2).
