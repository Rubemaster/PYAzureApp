In the case of a downwind rotor the tower shadow contributes to a considerable extent to the load spectrum. The flapwise bending moment is an important parameter for rotor blade dimensioning. The influence of the tower shadow is considerable, especially considering the high number of load cycles of 107 to 108 during the life of the turbine (Fig. 6.12). The tower shadow effect thus becomes a factor which cannot be ignored with regard to the fatigue life of the rotor blades.;The electric power output of downwind rotors is a clear indicator of the influence oftower shadow interference. In extreme cases, power losses of up to 30 or 40  below the average output were measured (Fig. 6.13). At the usual rotor speeds, the frequency of tower shadow interference falls within the range of some of the critical natural fre quencies of the turbine, in particular that of the drive train (Chapt. 11.2.4).;Last but not least, the influence of the tower shadow on the noise generated by thewind turbine must also be pointed out (Chapt. 15.2.2). This effect turned out to be of such importance that it caused the virtually complete disappearance of downwind rotors among todays wind turbines.;While power output and energy yield of a wind turbine are determined by the longterm variations of the mean wind speed, the noncyclic fluctuating loads on the wind turbine are determined by the shortterm fluctuations of the wind speed, the wind turbulence and the gusts. The everpresent wind turbulence contributes considerably to material fatigue, particularly of the rotor blades. Extreme wind speeds, though far more rare,
