144 CHAPTER 5 ROTOR AERODYNAMICSreasons, the inner blade area frequently does not have as strong a twist as would be desir able for aerodynamic reasons. Considering the low effective flow velocities in the inner blade area of the rotor, compromises are easily possible here. At stallcontrolled rotors, it is possible to use the twist to influence flow separation (stall) at a certain wind velocity. For this reason, rotor blades with fixed pitch angle are not line arly twisted but twisted to a greater extent in the inner area of the blade (up to 20 degrees) whereas the outer area has almost no twist. This variation in twist is determined not only by a certain stall characteristic but also by an improvement in the starting torque since the rotor blades cannot be adjusted to a blade pitch angle advantageous the startup behaviour by pitching the blade. The influence of different blade twist variations on rotor performance can be seen in Figure 5.54. Aiming at simplifying rotor blade manufacturing, the question arises whether a blade entirely without twist is aerodynamically acceptable. Doing without any twist obviously leads to a considerable reduction in power. For large turbines, this is too much of a compromise to be made in favour of simplified blade manufacture. Seen overall, determining the optimum blade twist requires a number of aspects to be taken into consideration which include both the type of power control pitch or stall and certain operational characteristics of the rotor. The choice of airfoil also has a certain influence.
