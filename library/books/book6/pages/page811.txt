Some other factors which affect the overall costs and their composition, albeit to a small extent, are not so much a matter of course.;The influence of the production environment where the product is manufactured shouldnot be underestimated. Initially, new products are almost always afflicted by the handicap of being manufactured in a production structure which was developed for other products. In other words, wind turbines can only be manufactured really economically in a wind turbine factory. Factories are built for products and not the other way round. This simple fact does not seem to be obvious to many supporters of a diversification in outdated fields of production. There is no other possible explanation for those attempts where a new product frequently enough turns out to be apparently uneconomic.;Another important factor is the production status that the product has achieved. Thecost structure of an individually manufactured prototype is different from that of a series produced product. This is mainly due to the fact that certain components become
