The magnetic coupling of the generator rotor to the grid frequency is dependent onpower, the same as the natural frequencies. This is shown clearly by the example of the American MOD0 test turbine (Fig. 7.13). This turbine was equipped with a synchro nous generator directly coupled to the grid. Strong vibrational resonances, a conse quence of the tower shadow excitation, among others, necessitated the subsequent installation of a damping hydraulic coupling in the highspeed shaft (Fig. 7.14).
