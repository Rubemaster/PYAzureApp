It was only in some relatively small turbines that attempts have been successful inimplementing a practicable passive blade pitch mechanism. The key to success was the variablespeed rotor. This provided a clear correlation between rotor speed, or the resul tant centrifugal force, respectively, and the desired power output. The older turbines of the Dutch manufacturer Lagerwey, for example, have passive blade pitching. The blades of the twobladed rotor of the older Lagerwey turbines are connected to the rotor hub by means of individual flapping hinges. With increasing wind speed, the blade pitch angle is adjusted passively against a springloaded mechanism as the rotor speed also in creases. The method has been successful in the smaller Lagerwey turbines with a rotor diameter of between 15 and 20 m (Fig. 9.29).;Passive blade pitch adjustment, and with it the absence of hydraulic or electricaldrives and electronic power and speed control arrangements, is without doubt a desir able simplification. This concept has, therefore, also been taken into consideration for larger wind turbines. However, dispensing with an active control system would have much more severe consequences, for example for the startup procedure or for an emer gency shutdown, so that it is doubtful if a passive blade pitch system is a practicable solution for large wind turbines.;To prevent a runaway of the rotor when its load is suddenly lost, large wind turbines can only brake the rotor by adjusting the pitch of the rotor blades (Chapt. 18.8). Apart from structural strength, the second most vital safety feature of a wind turbine is, therefore, the reliability of the blade pitching mechanism. With this in mind, redundancy in the compo nents and control circuits involved in rotor blade pitching is an indispensable requirement. A thorough reliability and failuremode analysis of the blade pitch mechanism should,
