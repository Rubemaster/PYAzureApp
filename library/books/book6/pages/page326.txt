There is no doubt that arranging all drive train components in the nacelle has its disadvantages. The tower structure must support the rotor and the nacelle which has consequences for its strength and stiffness. Installing the nacelle is complicated and it becomes more difficult to access and service the units. Nevertheless, arranging the mechanical and electrical components in line in the nacelle has become the standard design. Using this approach, the mechanical transmission paths are shortest and the dynamic problems are managed most easily. Today, almost all wind turbine systems are built in this style.;9.3.1 Gearbox between Rotor and Generator;Rotor, gearbox inbetween and generator is still the traditional design. It allows conven tional highspeed electric generators to be used. A supporting bedplate carries the drive train components mounted in line behind one another. All components are easily acces sible and, in the case of a repair, can be replaced individually without having to disman tle the turbine. Wind turbines of this design can be assembled easily from standard components developed by the supporting industry (Fig. 9.5). The advocates of this de sign point out other advantages. In comparison with the gearboxes direct drive of the
