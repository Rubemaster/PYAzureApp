Free yawing has been successfully used in some earlier American wind turbines of smaller and medium size (USWindpower, CARTER, ESI et al.). The ESI units had a downwind teetering rotor with a distinct coning angle. When fitted with additional dampers, free yawing apparently worked satisfactorily (Fig. 5.62). Other turbines, e.g. by CARTER, combined free yawing in strong winds with smallscale motorized yawing at low wind speeds. Attempts to introduce free yawing also to large turbines have not been successful so far. Thus, the WTS34 turbine has the same features downwind position, teetering rotor with cyclic blade pitch actuation and no tilted axis. Motorized yawing had not been intended originally but initial tests with the prototype showed that correct and stable free yawing of the rotor was not possible, so that a motorized yaw drive had to be subsequently installed.
