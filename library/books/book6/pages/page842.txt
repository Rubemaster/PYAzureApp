The total annual running costs for the operation of a commercial wind turbine or of a wind park, as a percentage of the exfactory price of the turbine or as a part of the an nual income, are easily overlooked (Table 19.22). The results in Table 19.22 are based on a statistical evaluation of numerous wind parks in Germany. The mean value of the annual operating costs of about 24  of the annual income corresponds to a proportion of about 2.2 Cent with reference to the assumed electricity sales revenue of 9 Cent per kilowatthour. In other countries the running costs could be lower due to the different labour costs.;Table 19.22. Total annual running costs of a wind turbine in the 2 MW class;The costs and economic viability of offshore projects for utilising wind energy are a separate story  even in this book. They differ from wind farms on land in at least three essential points The investment costs are higher which also applies to the operating costs which, from todays point of view, are still associated with great uncertainties. On the other hand, however, the usable mean wind velocities are also greater at sea so that some of the higher costs are partly cancelled out again by the higher energy delivery.;The higher investment costs for the offshore installation of wind turbines are determined by a number of factors. The associated additional costs are already easily assessable today and can also be substantiated by first empirical values. But there are still considerable un certainties in other areas, especially if it is a matter of an installation in relatively great depths of water and at a greater distance from the land. This applies particularly to the intended sites in the North Sea (s.a. Chapt. 17.4.1).
