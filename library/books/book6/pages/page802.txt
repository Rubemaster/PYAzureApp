Table 19.1. Scaling rules for the design parameters, the external forces and the material stresses, using the rotor blades as an example 2.;The problem has been dealt with in various investigations in past years 3. In theseinvestigations, detailed mass models were developed for wind turbines and for each major component, scaling rules were derived, taking into consideration the essential loads. The dimensioning load cases are complex and also differ greatly for the individ ual components. The rotating parts such as, e.g. rotor shaft, bearings and gearbox are dimensioned almost exclusively in accordance with the rated power or, putting it more precisely, in accordance with the torque to be transmitted. For this reason, an analytical penetration of the entire system is far more difficult than in the case of a comparatively simple component like a rotor blade.;Nevertheless, theoretical or semiempirical models can be used successfully especially when extrapolating upward from a certain size, the masses of which are known. The changes in the structural mass and the manufacturing costs with the rotor diameter were calculated under the said prerequisites for two basic technical designs in the study quoted. These basic designs, a twobladed unit and a unit with threebladed rotor, were then varied in certain features. The result showed the expected rise in specific structural mass with rotor diameter in the basic designs and all variants and the difference between the two concepts (Fig. 19.2).
