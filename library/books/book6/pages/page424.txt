(linecommutated inverters). In isolated operation, selfcommutated frequency inverters are required, but these are much more complex and expensive. The link circuit inverters can be controlled in various ways and completely decouple the frequency generated by the generator from the grid frequency which is why inverter systems with DC or voltage link circuit are now being used almost exclusively for wind turbine installations. The transistorbased frequency inverters are implemented with a voltage link circuit. They also operate with a pulse modulation method, the pulse width modulation (PWM) which results in an almost perfect approximation of the ideal sinusoidal wave shape of the trans formed frequency.;IGBT inverters with pulse width modulation in 12pulse mode thus represent the laststage in inverter technology for the time being. In most cases they are located in the tower base of the wind turbine (Fig. 10.26).;Variablespeed operation of a synchronous generator is usually effected via an inverter with DC link. The variablefrequency AC from the generator is rectified to DC and then fed into the grid via an AC inverter (Fig. 10.27).
