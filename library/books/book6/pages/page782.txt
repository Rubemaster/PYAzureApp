In most of the wind turbines, fire alarm systems are, therefore, used and will probably be prescribed in general. In the case of offshore installations, the risk of undetected fire sources is naturally even greater and fighting them within a short time is especially difficult. These applications may well require complete fire extinguishing systems.;Large turbines, like all large buildings projecting above the skyline of their surroundings, require warning markers for air traffic. The relevant regulations are passed by the appro priate national aviation authorities. In Germany, for example, this is the Ministry for Traf fic and Civil Engineering. According to the latest status, the following measures are re quired. The socalled daytime marking consists of a coat of red warning paint on the outer sections of the rotor. This is specified outside of towns and densely settled regions when the height of the building exceeds 100 m above the ground level. The marking consists of two stripes of red paint, one at the tip of the rotor blade and a second one closer in (Fig. 18.46). For a time, the authorities allowed the installation of a flashing white rotating lens beacon on the roof of the nacelle which is why some turbines do not have red mark ings on the rotor blade tips. Nighttime marking is not so easy to implement. It would be necessary to illuminate the highest points of the wind turbine, i.e. the rotor blade tips. For one, this represents a technical difficulty as common light bulbs cannot easily withstand
