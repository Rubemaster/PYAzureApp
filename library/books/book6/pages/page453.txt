In the minute range, they influence the operational sequence of the turbine. Even longerterm fluctuations, over hours up to seasonal changes, pose questions of avail ability or lead to the problem of energy storage.;With the two control variables of blade pitch and, in most larger turbines, thegenerator torque, two reference variables of wind turbine operation can be regulated rotor speed and power output. Speed control becomes indispensable when the speed is not maintained by the grid frequency. This is always the case in isolated opera tion. But speed control is also necessary in parallelgrid operation of turbines during startup or when shutting down and in generators with no direct connection to the grid.;Large turbines are, therefore, equipped with a combined speedpower control system. The interaction of speed and power control, the control structure, is determined by the type of generator system and by the desired operational sequence.;11.4.1 System Characteristics and Analytical Design Methods;The control structure of a turbine must be matched to the electricalmechanical energy conversion chain. Within this chain, five areas can be distinguished which can be under stood to be controlled subsystems of the overall control structure (Fig. 11.9).
