9.5 BLADE PITCH MECHANISM 335pitching in an emergency case. In some cases the functions of the central module and the accumulator module are integrated in one unit. These electronic components are subject to high demands with regard to reliability and redundancy. They are accommodated in airconditioned housings which can also be heated, if necessary, and must be able to withstand the centrifugal forces in rotating operation. The sensors for detecting the rotor blade pitch angle are also of special sig nificance. They must be redundantly provided for emergency rotor blade pitching. In most cases the components are accommodated completely in the interior of the ro tor hub in the larger turbines (Fig. 9.28). But the pitch motors also can be located out side the hub as seen in Figure 9.26.;The idea of using the aerodynamic or mass forces acting on the rotor blades to adjust the blades to the desired pitch is not new. Relevant attempts have been made in the past in several test turbines and prototypes to use of the windspeeddependent aerodynamic moment around the longitudinal axis of the blade, or the rotor thrust as the driving force for changing the pitch angle. However, it turned out that no usable passive pitch con trol could be achieved by this means. The correlation between these forces and the wind speed or the desired rotor speed and power output was not precise enough for them to be used as control parameters for blade pitching.
