712 CHAPTER 17 OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY UTILISATIONdistance from the coast. Up to end of 2008 a capacity of nearly 600 MW was reached. In 2008 the Round 3 has been launched.;In comparison with the countries mentioned above, the realisation of offshore projects has been delayed in Germany. The conditions in the NorthSea region are characterised by the fact that all serious projects beyond the mud flats, that is to say at relatively great depth of water and distance from the coast, are being pursued. In some cases, regions considered to be suitable are outside the territorial waters, the 12mile zone. For this reason, the strategy pursued is slightly different from, for example, that in Denmark. The location of the sites requires advanced technology if the requirements for economic feasibility are to be met. The wind turbines must be larger, preferably in the range of 4 to 5 MW, as must be the projects overall. Distances of over 60 or 70 km from the coast require technical expenditure for linkup with the grid which is only economically sup portable for very large projects. In addition, this also raises the question of how much power the grids on land can accept at the available infeed points. In the area of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, there are only a very few extrahigh voltage rails of 220 or 380 kV. Therefore the implementation of large wind farms off the German coast will not be possible without a certain expansion of the grids close to the coast.
