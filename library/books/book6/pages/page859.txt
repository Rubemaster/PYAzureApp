Table 20.2. Calculation of the electricity generation costs of a mediumsized wind turbine (rotor diameter of 40 m, 500 kW rated power, mean annual wind speed 5.5 ms at 30 m height);Annual Costs Maintenance, insurance, land lease (4  of exworks price) Service of capital (6  interest rate p.a.,), repayment period  within  10 years (annuity  13.59 )  20 years (annuity  8.72 );5.50 ms 0.1 m 6.00 ms;With the introduction of commercial wind turbines in the megawatt power class, the economic situation of wind power utilisation has moved forward another step. Large wind turbines with tower heights of 80100 m have advantages at sites with weaker wind regimes so that the economic area of the application of wind energy utilisation is clearly extended geographically (Table 20.3).;Apart from these economic figures, the fact also plays a role that scarce sites indensely settled areas are becoming more and more valuable. It will always be attempted, therefore, to utilise these sites with the largest turbine possible, an argument which has a decisive influence on the trend to use turbines of everincreasing size. Or, in other words the amount of electricity yielded by a given area of land could be come the decisive criterion for longterm profitability. This argument militates for the trend towards ever larger wind turbines, regardless of the fact, based on physics, that
