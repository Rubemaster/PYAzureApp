778 CHAPTER 18 WIND TURBINE INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONdrag (Figs. 18.51 and 18.52). The result is a deteriorating power curve which, in turn, can considerably reduce the energy output. Up to 30  of the annual energy delivery can thus be lost at sites with a particularly high risk of icing 9.;Fears that ice accretion on the rotor blades will lead to an unacceptable load on theblades or on the entire wind turbine are unfounded. The deformation of the rotor blade airfoil due to ice deposits degrades its aerodynamic properties to such an extent that rotor performance is reduced and with it the aerodynamic loads.;The potential danger of ice accretion lies in fact that lumps of ice of considerableweight can be hurled away by the rotating rotor over distances of several hundred me ters. Investigations of the ranges of lumps of ice hurled away have arrived at the rec ommendation that the safety distance should be 1.5 times the sum of tower height and rotor diameter 9.
