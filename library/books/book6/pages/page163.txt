Last, but not least, an important aspect to be considered when choosing the tipspeed ratio is the aerodynamic noise emission of the rotor. The higher the tipspeed ratio, the greater the aerodynamic noise emission, and nowadays this factor is of decisive impor tance in the selection of the design tipspeed ratio (Chapt. 15.2.2). In conclusion it may be stated that a trend in favour of extreme tipspeed ratios is no longer justified. For the foreseeable future at least, very high tipspeed ratios will cause additional problems rather than presenting a definite advantage. Design tipspeed ratios of 9 to 10 for twobladed rotors and 6 to 8 with threebladed ones are common today and should not be exceeded without a valid reason.;The rotor blades of current wind turbines reflect the different compromises between the optimum aerodynamic shape, the requirements of strength and stiffness and concessions to economic manufacturing (Figs. 5.58 and 5.59). Naturally, blade material also plays a significant part in the design. The optimum aerodynamic shape can be approximated much better by design concepts involving glassfibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) than by rotor blades made, e.g., entirely of metal as in some earlier experimental turbines. Nearly all rotor blades have a trapezoidal shape which more or less approximates the optimum aerodynamic contour. The aspect ratio is remarkably high compared to aircraft wings where only the wings of highperformance gliders are built with such high aspect ratios. This extreme slenderness results in an aerodynamically optimum blade thickness
