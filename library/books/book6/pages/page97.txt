From this equation it follows that, in purely formal terms, power would have to be at its maximum when  is zero, namely when the air is brought to a complete standstill by the converter. However, this result does not make sense physically. If the outflow velocity  behind the converter is zero, then the inflow velocity before the converter must also become zero, implying that there would be no more flow through the converter at all. As could be expected, a physically meaningful result consists in a certain numerical ratio of    where the extractable power reaches its maximum. This requires another equation expressing the mechanical power of the converter. Using the law of conservation of momentum, the force which the air exerts on the converter can be expressed as;According to the principle of action equals reaction, this force, the thrust, must be counteracted by an equal force exerted by the converter on the airflow. The thrust, so to speak, pushes the air mass at air velocity , present in the plane of flow of the converter. The power required for this is
