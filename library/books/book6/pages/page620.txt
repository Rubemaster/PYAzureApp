The frequency spectra provide information about the sources of the noise. They are thus primarily of interest to the designer of the wind turbine.;The permissible sound pressure level which a noise source may generate as a continuous nuisance at a certain location has been prescribed by legislation. Regulations governing these levels vary from country to country. In the Federal Republic of Ger many, the standard values are based on the above mentioned DIN standard and are pre scribed by law. The maximum values depend on the nature of the surroundings and on the time of day The permissible noise levels vary from country to country. Some ex amples are shown in Table 15.2.;These regulations must also be observed in the operation of wind turbines. One important and necessary aspect must not be ignored the increase in the natural ambient noise with wind speed. It would not make sense to require the noise of a wind turbine at full load, which generally occurs at wind speeds exceeding 10 ms, to be 35 dB(A), i.e. lower than the ambient noise. At these wind speeds, the noise of a wind turbine will be masked by the ambient noise. A sensible interpretation of the noise emission standards must, therefore, be based on the loudness level, that is the noise level which is gener ated by the wind turbine and which exceeds background noise made by the wind.;Table 15.2.
