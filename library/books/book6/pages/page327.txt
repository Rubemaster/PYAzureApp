In addition, the high torque of the slowrunning rotor does not load all components due to the torque converter, the gearbox. As a result, the total weight of the drive train and of the nacelle, respec tively, becomes better than with the gearless design. This trend is confirmed at least by the installations built to the present day.;Fig. 9.5. Nacelle of the standarddesign General Electric GE 1.5 sl (GE);A very special design with the gearbox between rotor and generator has beenachieved in the Liberty turbine of the US manufacturer Clipper Windpower (Fig.9.6). The twostage planetary gearbox has four relatively fast drive shafts, each of which drives a generator. The advantages mentioned are the largely modular design and the low load on the drive train due to the distribution of the torque. This is intended to re duce the component masses with respect to assembly and handling during maintenance work.;However, this must be compared with the fact that, seen overall, the gearbox is quitecomplex. The Liberty turbine is the first commercial largescale wind turbine developed in the US after the experimental turbines of the nineteeneighties. The BritishAmerican mannufacturers consortium has announced the development of a 7.5 MW turbine and points out that this concept is particularly suitable for extremely large turbines. The recent experiences with the Clipper turbines are somewhat disappointing, so it is ques tionable if the production will be continued.
