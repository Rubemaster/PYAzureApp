Table 19.20. Investment costs of two turnkey installed wind turbines. Small wind turbine on a lowvoltage grid and mediumsized wind turbine on a mediumvoltage grid;Total Investment Costs 79 500 132.5  587 000 117.4 ;The installation of a single wind turbine for operation on a mediumvoltage grid, which can in most cases only be reached at a relatively great distance, already requires higher siterelated costs. These range between 20 and 25  of the exworks price. The lower values can only be attained with the transformer being incorporated in the wind turbine.;Table 19.21 shows the costs for a typical wind park, divided into the most important cost positions. Without considering the financing costs, the specific costs were between 1500 and 1900 US per kilowatt in 2010. A further 25  of the technical investment costs must be set aside for the financing. The example relates to an average situation in flat, easily accessible terrain with grid connection over a distance of 6 km.;Geographical conditions and the grid connection naturally also have an influence onthe investment costs. Small wind parks with a total power output of up to about 1520 MW can still be connected to the mediumvoltage grid. Since this is closely meshed in densely settled regions, the distances to be bridged are not too great on average. The conditions are different with large wind farms with total power outputs of more than 20 MW. Wind farms of this size in most cases have to be connected to the high voltage grid (110 or 220 kV). The distances to be covered by the transfer line are greater which increases the costs for the grid connection. In many cases, a completely new transformer substation needs to be built and financed.
