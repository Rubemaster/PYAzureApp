Apart from the rotor power, there are other parameters which are of significance incharacterizing rotor performance. The most important of these is the behaviour of the torque (Fig. 5.14). Analogously to the power, the rotor torque can also be calculated by using a socalled torque coefficient, as follows;The rotor power curves and the torque curves are the characteristic features of each rotor configuration. The magnitude of the power coefficients and the shape of the curves both show distinct differences. The main parameters dominating the cPR map are   number of rotor blades  chord length distribution of the blades (planform)  aerodynamic airfoil characteristics  twist variation of the blades
