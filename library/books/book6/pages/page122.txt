5.3 AERODYNAMIC POWER CONTROL 107power range which can be controlled by varying the rotor speed is very limited so that changing the rotor speed can only be considered as a supplementary option. Reducing the aerodynamically effective rotor swept area, i.e. turning the rotor out of the wind (furling), is only practicable with very small rotors.;5.3.1 Power Control by Rotor Blade Pitching;By far the most effective way of influencing the aerodynamic angle of attack, and thus the input power, is by mechanically adjusting the rotor blade pitch angle (Fig. 5.18). For this purpose, in general, the rotor blade is turned about its longitudinal axis with the aid of actively controlled actuators. There have also been attempts to achieve passive pitch control by utilizing the effect of centrifugal forces (s. Chapt. 8.4).;In principle, power control by changing the aerodynamic angle of attack of the rotorcan be achieved by two methods. The conventional approach is by adjusting the angle of attack of the blade to a smaller angle in order to reduce power input. Conversely, increasing the angle of attack increases the power input. The other possibility is to change the blade pitch angle to a larger angle of attack up to the socalled critical aero dynamic angle of attack, at which point the airflow separates at the surface of the rotor blades, thus limiting the aerodynamic power input. This effect is known as as tall. The advantage of this method is that the necessary turning angle for pitching the blade is smaller.
