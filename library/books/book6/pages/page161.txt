5.5.5 Design TipSpeed Ratio of the Rotor;The rotor design tipspeed ratio is a constantly recurring theme in the discussion of performance criteria and aerodynamic parameters. Many parameters show a strong dependence on the tipspeed ratio of the rotor. This raises the obvious question of what is the optimum tipspeed ratio for a wind rotor? Can it be optimized mathematically and what are the criteria for its selection?;To answer the second question first it is not possible to determine the best tipspeedratio mathematically. It is, on the contrary, a system parameter for the entire wind turbine, the influence of which extends far beyond rotor aerodynamics. To make this dear, it is useful to ask about the motives for the comparatively large tipspeed ratio of modern wind rotors.;In the beginning, there was primarily the endeavour to bring the rotor speed as closeas possible to the much faster rotating electric generator. Mechanical stepup gearboxes with very high gear ratios were expensive and also presented problems in other respects. However, gearbox development has made considerable progress in the past decades. At present, gearboxes, as they are being used in the more recent turbines, are technically matured and, when compared to the complete system, relatively inexpensive. This largely reduces the necessity of having highspeed rotors. However, a higher design tip speed ratio, which is tantamount to a higher rotational speed of the rotor, means that the desired power can be generated by a lower torque which, in turn, means a reduced weight of the rotor shaft and gearbox.;Another argument for a high tipspeed ratio is that with increasing tipspeed ratio, therequired rotor solidity initially decreases rapidly (Fig. 5.56). Less rotor solidity means less material is required for the rotor blades and thus, in principle, lower costs.
