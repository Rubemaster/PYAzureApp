14.7 MAJOR DESIGN FEATURES AND ENERGY YIELD 601gain in energy yield (s.a. Chapt. 12.8). Whilst the tower costs can be determined rela tively accurately, calculating the additional gain in energy yield is much more difficult and inaccurate. It is related to the site and, moreover, accompanied by considerable un certainty when the rotor hub height exceeds about 100 m.;The cutin and cutout wind speeds of a wind turbine are, to a certain extent, arbitrary choices. The cutin speed does have a lower limit due to the power required for over coming the friction losses in the drive train. It can, however, be given a certain tolerance at the top for operational reasons, i.e. to avoid an excessive number of startup and shut down operations during periods of low wind speeds.;At very high wind speeds, between about 20 and 25 ms, the turbines operation under load is stopped for safety reasons. With regard to the energy yield, it is of no conse quence whether the rotor is braked into a parked position or whether it continues to rotate without load. There is no generally valid criterion indicating at what wind speed the turbine should be shut down.;Against this background, the question needs to be asked in what way a restricted operational wind speed range would affect the energy yield. Figure 14.43 shows the effect of a deviation of the cutin and cutout speeds from the specified nominal values on the annual energy yield. Both the relatively low energy content of the low wind speeds and the infrequency of high wind speeds are reasons why the influence of the operational wind speed range on the energy yield is not too great, as long as the variations remain within reasonable limits. It should be noted that the wind turbines sequence control crite ria can cause a hysteresis in the cutin and cutout behaviour. The cutout hysteresis, in particular, can reduce the production time on the grid. A certain energy loss due to this effect cannot be avoided.
