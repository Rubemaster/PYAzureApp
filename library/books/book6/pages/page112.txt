As modern electronic computer systems have become available in recent decades, elaborate numeric methods of flow simulation have been developed. They are used today in many areas of aviation and vehicle aerodynamics. It appears obvious to apply these methods also to wind rotors. The basic principle consists in dividing the entire space of the flow around an object to be examined into small volume elements and determining and joining together the flow states in the individual elements. This could be called a numeric wind tunnel 6.;In this numeric flow simulation, also called CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)for short, the Eulerian equations of motion form the mathematical basis for the part of the flow considered to be largely frictionless and the NavierStokes equations form the basis for the flow with friction close to the wall of the body (boundary layer). The basic physical equations such as the equation of continuity (conservation of mass), the law of conservation of momentum (equilibrium of forces) etc. are set up in all three spatial directions in the volume elements. They describe the relationship between forces of inertia, friction and pressure and the effects of external forces. This results in a system
