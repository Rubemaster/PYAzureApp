For this reason, the towers of the turbines are occasionally also used as cranes as already tried out in the large experimental installa tions of the nineteeneighties. In the example shown in Figure 18.25, a Vestas V66 was mounted on a 117mhigh lattice tower without using a large crane. To this, the tower was provided with a special crane superstructure and the nacelle and the rotor were pulled up at the tower.
