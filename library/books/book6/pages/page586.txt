576 CHAPTER 14 POWER OUTPUT AND ENERGY YIELDa certain degree. But in these turbines, too, a noticeable reduction in performance is observed in the partialload region. Soiling of the blades causes much more problems at stall controlled wind turbines. Fig ure 14.21 shows an example of the deterioration in the power curve due to soiled rotor blades. This is a 750kW stallcontrolled unit with a tower height of 50 m which is standing at about 600 m above MSL in a wind park in Northern Spain on a plateau with little growth, but a sandy ground surface. The power curve was measured after an operating period of about three months in summer. The soiling on the blade surface is partly washed off again by rain  but almost never completely , so a significant power deficit remained without cleaning the rotor blades. The relatively elaborate washing of the rotor blades may, therefore, be advisable at some sites. A prolonged operation with badly soiled rotor blades would lead to a too great a loss in energy yield.;Apart from the electric quality criteria discussed elsewhere (Chapt. 9.2), the uniformity of the power output is also a criterion for quality. Figures 14.22 to 14.24 illustrate the wide range of power variations for different technical wind turbine concepts.
