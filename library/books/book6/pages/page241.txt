226 CHAPTER 6 LOADS AND STRUCTURAL STRESSEScomplement each other. For this reason, nearly all recent turbines are equipped with both of these system features.;The theoretical determination of the structural stresses to which a wind turbine is sub jected under the different loading conditions and in the various operating modes still has its limits in spite of elaborate and complex mathematical methods. Although significant advances have been achieved in this field in recent years, a refinement of expertise, especially in the area of fatigue loads occurring in longterm operation, is essential if the weights of the components, and thus ultimately also the manufacturing costs, are to be reduced further. Apart from the development of mathematical models, therefore, the measurement of stresses actually occurring has occupied a predominant position in numerous research and development projects for many years. Some of the earlier large experimental wind turbines had literally been designed as testbeds for the investigation of loads. Such measurements are still being carried out in newly developed turbines even today.
