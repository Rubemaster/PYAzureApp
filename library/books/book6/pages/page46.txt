In the years from 1930 to 1940, Germany saw much theoretical and design activityin the field of wind power technology. The motivation behind this was in part certainly the striving by the German Reich for selfsufficiency in the supply of fuel and power. In 1939, the Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft Windkraft, RAW, was formed, where renowned scientists, technicians and industrial firms worked together. The RAW supported nu merous projects and published their results in socalled memoranda.;Among the projects on which the work of the RAW was concentrated, one deservesspecial mention. In 1937, the engineer Franz Kleinhenz published plans of a large wind turbine project 12. Unlike Honnef, Kleinhenz knew how to win the cooperation of renowned scientists and industrial firms. His plans took shape in cooperation with the Maschinenfabrik AugsburgNrnberg (MAN). His concept was improved and refined in many details in a number of stages from 1938 to 1942 (Fig. 2.7). Even today, the
