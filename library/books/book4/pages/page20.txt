Having performed the steps and analyses described in sections 4 and 5, a financial evaluation of the investment case can now be conducted. The evaluation is partially based on outputs from the financial model, the contrac tual structure for the project and on the outcome of the risk assessment process. Key figures like DSCR and project IRR (internal rate of return) are the main figures to investigate, whereas equity IRR is the most interesting measure for equity investors. As noted above, these figures are also often subject to requirements in order for the project to undergo approval of financing.;Investments in wind projects are as other projects subject to uncertainty. Consequently, financial performance will be uncertain. Static wind business case models that;Investments in wind projects are as other projects subject to uncertainty. Consequently, financial performance will be uncertain. Static wind business case models thatonly represent expected outcomes will therefore often have some limitations with providing the information to support informed investment decisions. Conversely, a scenariobased or a simulationbased approach provides better insight into the investment case and enables decision makers to make better investment decisions. We describe this approach in detail below.;The figure below shows output from a simulation model prepared for a wind project in the form of the distribution and the probability of various IRRs at project level given yearly variations in energy production. The hatched area illustrates the simulated outcomes where project IRR is below the required rate of return. In our example, the wind project will generate an IRR that exceeds a required return of 9 with a probability of 86. Adding additional uncertainties to the investment case, such as varying power prices, risk of capex overruns, opex varia tions, etc. may widen the distribution of project IRR and move the expected IRR.
