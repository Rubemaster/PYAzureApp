Therefore we advise proper facilitation of a risk workshop in order to ensure that all risks, their outcome probability and financial impact are assessed correctly.in a project at a given stage, ensuring an adequate, thorough and objective evaluation.;We often find that risk workshops that are somewhat structured and operationalized through for example a risk matrix as shown below are more valuable for the future process. It facilitates mapping of the identified risks according to the magnitude of the potential impact and the probability of the risk materialising into an unwanted outcome. The matrix can further be applied for prioritising the identified risks and determining derisking actions on the most urgent risks.;Based on our experience it is often a good basis for the development process to have a risk workshop, where the individual risks of a project are identified and discussed amongst the different stakeholders in the project. As these stakeholders might change during the develop ment process, it can be a good idea to have several workshops throughout the process.
