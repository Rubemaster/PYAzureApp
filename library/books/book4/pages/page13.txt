4.4 Operating costs In our experience, onshore and offshore wind farms operate with a rather high EBITDA margin of approx. 6090, which reflects the low marginal cost of producing power from wind turbines. In this section we discuss and provide benchmarks for the different categories of operating costs (opex).;Some operating costs such as land lease, insurance, management costs and maintenance costs (OM) canbe fixed at a yearly amount. However, depending on the contractual structure of the project, some of these costs may also vary with production on a perMWh basis or as a percentage of revenue which will form a hedge on operating costs.;The main elements of opex include costs for OM and asset management. OM will often be covered for approx. 510 years by a service contract with the turbine supplier. However, in the current market, we observe service contracts with durations of up to 15 and 20 years. It is important to consider costs not covered by the contract and potential changes in operating costs after expiry of the service contracts. Over the operational life the turbines will be worn down and additional costs can apply due to more frequent maintenance, breakdowns, etc.;Opex for an offshore wind farm is somewhat higher than for an onshore farm due to greater costs of accessing and maintaining turbines. Harsh marine environment can also increase the failure frequency of some components. Offshore wind farm opex level and split are illustrated in the figure.
