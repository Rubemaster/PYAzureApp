This trend has translated into rapid renewable energy commercialisation and consider able industry expansion, of which the wind industry is a good example. According to Clean Energy Trends 2014, investments in new capacity of wind energy increased from approx. USD 4bn in 2000 to approx. USD 59bn in 2013. While annual investments in 2013 were down from USD 74bn in 2012 the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 23 in 20002013. Annual investments in the industry are projected to grow even further up to USD 94bn by 2023.1;With a total of 35 GW installed wind energy capacity in 2013, annual installations were down from the recordhigh 45 GW in 2012. Of the 35 GW, China added more than 16 GW, whereas Europe accounted for 12 GW of new capacity. In 2013 global installed wind capacity reached a total of 318 GW.2;The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that total onshore wind capacity will reach 546 GW by 2020 and 923 GW by 2035. Offshore wind capacity will add 175 GW to this, and the wind industrys share of global energy generation will increase significantly up to 2035. By then it is expected that wind energy will account for approx. 7.3 of total power generation, up from 1.6 in 2011.3 On a longer horizon, IEA has updated the 2050 target of total global power originating from wind energy from 12 to 1518.4;The development in the wind industry is still dependent on public subsidies and political willingness to support the industry. On the 2020 horizon action plans have been put in place globally. The EU has ambitions of 20 renewable energy by 2020, whereas China and Japan have specific plans for increasing wind energy capacity. The US has a target of 80 renewable energy by 2035, which includes 54 GW of offshore energy by 2030.5;The aim of this paper is to promote diligent business case analyses. This is in the interest of all industry participants since it will give decision makers a better understanding of wind farm economics, profit opportunities and risks related to wind investments.
