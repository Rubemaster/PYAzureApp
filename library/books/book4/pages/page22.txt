When performing a cash flow analysis on a wind project there are certain pitfalls that should be avoided. In particular the cash flow analysis should take into account the varying capital structure of the project as well as the timevarying risk of the project. These characteristics mean that the required rate of return is not fixed over the life of the project. Due to varying capital structures we recommend using an adjusted present value (APV) approach which can take this dynamic into account by valuing the tax shield from interest payments separately.;Apart from the capital structure, the required rate of return will vary over time due to changes in the projectsrisk profile. For instance, when maintenance contracts or PPAs expire, the project will be exposed to somewhat more risk, and the investors should require a higher return at this stage in the project.;However, a dynamic required rate of return can be difficult to model and communicate to the relevant stakeholders. Below we illustrate and describe pros and cons of different approaches to handling the required rate of return when performing a cashflow analysis. The simple approach is the easiest to implement, understand and communicate, but it comes at the costs of greater imprecision and uncertainty.
