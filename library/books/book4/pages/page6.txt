Based on benchmark data we have been able to perform various analyses on project costs of offshore wind farms. For example we find that larger turbines and greater site depth have increased total project costs per installed MW historically.;This is supported by the figure below which shows project costs for 34 offshore projects worldwide (blue dots) and compares it to sea depth at the project site and size ofthe employed turbines. The green trend lines illustrate increasing project costs with increasing site depth and turbine size, respectively. The latter might seem counter intuitive and could in part be explained by the fact that larger turbines may comprise new and relatively unproven technology. The positive relation between project costs and site depth may be explained by the fact that greater site depth requires larger and more complex foundations to be built which in turn leads to higher project costs.;In general, it is the perception in the market that applying larger turbines will decrease total project costs due to fewer foundations and installations per installed MW inthe future. In addition, innovation and standardisation are expected to help the industry in realising its cost reduction targets of up to 40 for offshore wind energy.
