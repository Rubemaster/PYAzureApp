3. Framing the investment caseof operations during which the upfront investment is recouped. The figure below illustrates the main steps of developing a project from idea to a commissioned wind farm.;The development stage is characterised by establishment of the project layout on basis of for example environmental, geotechnical and wind studies. The turbines should be placed such that soil and wind conditions favour lower capex and higher energy production. Furthermore, a preliminary financial model is built in order to assess if the investment case can be expected to be economically feasible. Often a financial adviser is appointed early in the process to bring in experience and expertise with assessing the investment case and enhance the probability of successfully undertaking the project.;During maturation wind studies and wind farm design are refined in order to secure optimal layout of the wind farm. Procurement contracts on construction elements and turbine service are conditioned on the construction start or the commissioning of the project. New insights on production, capex and opex feed into a refinement of the financial model which in turn supports financial consent from investors and lenders. After FID the project goes into the final stages of the project lifecycle, which includes construction and afterwards operation.;As the financial model is continuously developed from the early stage of a project and refined and adjusted throughout project development, it is important to make solid conside rations about the structure of the model already at an early stage of development. When performing a wind investmentcase analysis we turn to 7 key elements that need to be evaluated in order to properly understand the investment base case and conduct sensitivity analyses. The figure below illustrates the 7 key elements that frame the investment case analysis.
