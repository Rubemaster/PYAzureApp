At the P90 level the difference in AEP is approx. 7, which shows that production uncertainty is greater in the short term relative to in the long term due to averaging effects of wind variability in the long term. In section 4.7 we illustrate how wrongful assessment of production uncertainty can significantly affect the understanding of project viability.;Additionally, there may be other timerelated factors that affect the expected production level of a wind farm such as degradation of blades as a result of wind and dust tearing the smooth blade surface into a more rugged surface, which in some cases lead to a decrease in turbine efficiency of 0.51 per year.;However, by planning specific maintenance of blades, this degradation can be avoided at the cost of an increase in operating costs. Also, the expected avail ability of the wind farm tends to decrease during the operational life due to more frequent maintenance and turbine breakdowns.;The figure below illustrates how different production levels depend on the horizon that it is viewed upon due to the levelling out of yearonyear wind variability as well as the assumption applied regarding degradation. The solid lines show the relation between the produc tion measure and the assumption of no efficiency degra dation, whereas the dotted lines show how production level decreases over the operational life due to a yearly efficiency degradation of 0.5.;The arguments outlined in this section illustrate and underpin how expected production is related to uncer tainty. In particular we have shown that separating production uncertainty into static uncertainty and yearonyear variability lead to a more detailed view on assumptions about expected production levels.
