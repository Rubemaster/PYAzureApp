Furthermore, the effect of changes in project finance structures, production guarantees or service agreements can be tracked all the way to the shape of the IRR distribution. Thereby it becomes clearer how a change in assumptions affects the risk and rate of return on the project enabling decision makers to directly assess the impact when changing and narrowing in project assump tions throughout the development of the project.;Given variations between wind projects risks it is our experience that the discount factor varies among projects. The figure below illustrates our experience from different ranges for posttax required returns for on and offshore wind projects depending on whether the project is in the developing or the operational phase for most developed countries.
