We have illustrated how different countries have struc tured their incentive schemes. While there are many different subsidy schemes for wind energy we only show the 3 main subsidy scheme structures FeedinTariff (FiT), Renewable Obligations (RO) and Tax credits. A FiT may be a constant tariff paid per MWh produced in addition to the market price or a fixed payment regard less of the level of the power price. Also, the FiT can be capped when the market price and subsidy combined reaches a certain level, which for example is the case in Denmark and the Netherlands.;ROs often take form as a general obligation forced upon power utilities to source part of their consumption from renewable sources. The scheme can be combined with renewable energy certificates, which are traded in a secondary market and which power suppliers must buy in order to prove their support to renewable energy generation. This is for example the case in Norway, Sweden and the UK.;We note that even though some of the countries in the table above apply the same main subsidy structure, there are significant variations in the size and duration as well as the underlying conditions for being eligible for subsidies between the individual countries. Also incentive schemes are subject to changes and may differ between onshore and offshore wind farms.
