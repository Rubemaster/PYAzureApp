Model uncertainty relates to the uncertainty of the param eters estimated based on the wind study. Consequently, while wind studies are often based on very complex models, there is a risk that they contain estimation errors, such as measurement errors andor model errors.;Measurement errors include that measured wind charac teristics may not be correct due to for example dysfunc tional measurement instruments or incorrect calibration of these. Model errors for example relate to the risk that measured historical wind conditions are not representa tive of the future wind conditions.;Furthermore, the wind study may be wrong with respect to assessing the effect a turbine has on the turbine specific production of the turbine behind it, which is called wake effects. The size of the wake effects is affected by factors such as wind speed, wind density, turbulence and distance between turbines, meaning that wake effectsmay be larger when the wind is coming from a direction in which turbines are located closer to each other.;We consider model uncertainty as a static uncertainty, which means that it is fixed over time. This implies that if the wind study has underestimated the true wind average speed or wake effects for the first operational year, it will be underestimated in all years. Consequently, taking wind study uncertainty into account, we reach static P75 and P90 measures that are fixed over the life of the project.;In the figure below we illustrate how different P measures are affected by how wind variability is taken into account (whether wind variability is averaged or not). The blue line illustrates production uncertainty when all production uncertainty is considered on an average basis, while the green line illustrates production uncertainty when wind variability is based on shortterm uncertainty.
