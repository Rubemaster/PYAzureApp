The aim of every investment case analysis is to assess project viability, project uncertainty and to ensure that all relevant factors have been considered prior to final investment decision (FID). Such analyses provide decision makers with a better understanding of wind farm economics, profit opportunities and the risks of wind investments.;Throughout the paper we will address 5 key steps when assessing a wind investment case. In section 3 we discuss the initial considerations which an investor should make when deciding if a given wind investment is desirable. In section 4 we provide a more detailed description of the specific inputs required to perform the investment case analysis. In section 5 we take a view on the risks and uncertainties related to the investment case, whereas in section 6 we describe how the relevant elements are combined into an investment analysis. We end this paper with section 7 where we discus some potential pitfalls when valuing a wind project.;From our point of view, the main challenges in performing a wind investment case analysis are assessing the expected level of energy production and energy prices as well as the future political regime. Despite their uncertain nature we will demonstrate how these elements can still be implemented in the investment case in a useful way.;Consequently, this paper merely describes how a wind investment case should be addressed in order to fully assess the characteristics of risks and returns. We also illustrate how to apply benchmark data for a preliminary valuation during the initial project development stages and emphasise key input parameters and uncertainties to which the investor should pay additional attention.
