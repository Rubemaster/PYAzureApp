STARTUP WIND SPEED The lowest wind speed at which a WT will begin rotation but not necessarily have a net energy output. SURVML WIND SPEED The maximum wind speed a WT in automatic, unattended operation can sustain and remain operable.;SWEPT AREA Area perpendicular to the rotor axis that a rotor will cover during one complete rotation. TAILVANE Vertical aerodynamic surface used for wind turbine control, (l) in some HAWTs for yaw orientation and control, (2) in some VAWTs to coordinate cyclic blade pitch.;THRUST COEFFICIENT (Cr) For HAWT see axial thrust coefficient. For VAWT The net time averaged force experienced by a rotor in the direction of the wind (0 divided by the product of the dynamic pressure of the undisturbed wind flow and the frontal area of the rotor swept volume.
