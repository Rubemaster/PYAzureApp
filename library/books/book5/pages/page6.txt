POWER LAW Mathematical idealization of a wind speed profile defined by r ., fh2l N Y2 v rIFlwhere h1 is the height above ground, hz is the height above ground, Vl is the wind speed at height h1, Vz is the wind speed at height h2, and N is the constant exponent.;PROJECTED AREA Area covered at any instant by the rotor blades, as seen from the direction of wind velocity. (Area solidly covered by the blades as opposed to the swept area.);RAYLEIGH DISTRIBUTION A probability distribution function, commonly used to describe the variation in a wind speed over an extended period. Expressed as n u f nIul2l p(u,  T u, p t 4 IEJ where p(u) is the Rayleigh probalility function, u is the wind speed, and u is the long term mean wind speed. (When integrated and evaluated between specified limits, will indicate the fraction of time spent within these limits.)
