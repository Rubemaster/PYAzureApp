 A Leicestershire council withdrew noise and cultural heritage objections to a wind farm of 125 turbines, 80m high, after English Heritage withdrew an objection. The Judge recognised that the quality of view could be eroded but this was not considered so harmful as to justify refusing permission. Noise would be within nationally accepted limits and suggested conditions were reasonable and enforceable.42; Nine 125m wind turbines were approved in Essex after an inspector found that they would not dominate the landscape because, since they were built on lowlying arable land, they would be viewed against the broad expanse of the sky. In the inspectors opinion, most local properties had various views and the wind turbines would not make them unattractive places to live. 43
