The Community Benefit Protocol In February 2011 the trade association RenewableUK brought together some of the different sorts of benefits into a scheme called the Community Benefits Protocol. The Protocol was originally a benefit package worth a minimum of 1,000 per megawatt (now worth 5,000 per megawatt), per year of installed wind power during the lifetime of the wind farm (typically 25 years). The Protocol was designed to account for the fact that not all communities are the same, and they will not all necessarily want the same sorts of benefits so it contains flexibility to tailor schemes to match the wishes of communities and covers financial payments and or benefits in kind and profit sharing or community ownership.;In response to the Government report, DECC is expecting the onshore wind industry, as represented by RenewableUK (trade body for England), to announce a revision to their existing community benefit protocol to increase the current recommended community benefit package value in England fivefold from 1,000MW of capacity per year to 5,000MW of capacity per year for the lifetime of the windfarm (usually around 25 years). To put this in context 5,000MW for a 20MW windfarm (or around eight turbines) would mean 100,000 per year that could be used to fund programmes to roll out energy efficiency measures, employ neighbourhood energy advisors, establish local skills and training projects, provide meaningful electricity bill offsets for many individual households or other community initiatives that local people might want.;The previous Government said that it would not put the requirements of a community benefit package in legislation, in order to allow for a degree of flexibility in the types and levels of benefit packages offered. A revised Community Benefit Protocol was subsequently published by RenewableUK in October 2013 to reflect the recommended changes.
