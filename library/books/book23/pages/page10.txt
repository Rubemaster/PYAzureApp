The Conservative Government has not yet announced whether or not it will renew the recovery of renewable energy projects.in the 18 June 2015 written ministerial statement (for more information see section 4 below).;At a local level individual local planning authorities are likely to produce renewable energy studies in order to inform the evidence base for their local plans. The NPPF directs that each local planning authority should produce a local plan. The local plan will contain policies relating to renewable energy in that particular area. Some LPAs also produce supplementary planning guidance to accompany the local plan with more detail about policy in a particular area. An example of this is the Cumbria wind energy supplementary planning document. It is up to each individual LPA whether it wants to produce supplementary guidance.;I want to give particular scrutiny to planning appeals involving renewable energy developments so that I can consider the extent to which the new practice guidance is meeting the Governments intentions. To this end, I am hereby revising the appeals recovery criteria and will consider for recovery appeals for renewable energy developments. This new criterion is added to the recovery policy issued on 30 June 2008 and will be applied for a period of six months from today after which it will be reviewed.;On 9 April 2014 the then Secretary of State announced that he would continue to consider for recovery appeals for renewable energy developments for a further 12 months.11 This time period has not been further extended by the new Government, which has not yet announced whether or not this will be renewed.
