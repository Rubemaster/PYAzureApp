Onshore wind now makes a meaningful contribution to our energy mix and has been part of the necessary increase in renewable capacity. Onshore windfarms often fail to win public support, however, and are unable by themselves to provide the firm capacity that a stable energy system requires. As a result, we will end any new public subsidy for them and change the law so that local people have the final say on windfarm applications.;In the Queens speech, on 27 May 2015, an Energy Bill was announced, which (among other things) would remove onshore wind farms of over 50 megawatts in size from the nationally significant infrastructure project development consent regime, as established by the Planning Act 2008. Under the Planning Act 2008 regime the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate change is the final decision maker on whether to grant development consent to wind farms of this size. Under the Bill onshore wind would no longer need development consent from the Secretary of State and would instead require planning permission granted by the relevant local planning authority. The Governments background notes provided some further information; This will mean that in future the primary decision maker for onshore wind consents in England and Wales will be the local planning authority. These changes will be supported by changes to the national planning policy framework to give effect to the manifesto commitment that local communities should have the final say on planning applications for wind farms.;In a written ministerial statement on 18 June 2015 the Government announced new considerations to be applied to proposed wind energy development so that local people have the final say on wind farm applications.18 These considerations took effect from 18 June 2015 and should be taken into account in planning decisions. When determining planning applications for wind energy development involving one or more wind turbines, local planning authorities should only grant planning permission if
