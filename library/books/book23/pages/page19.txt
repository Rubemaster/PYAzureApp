It is sometimes suggested that local planning authorities have been at fault in rejecting too many applications for onshore wind farms, but the issue is not so simple. Some appeals to planning inspectors result in rejection, normally on grounds of damage to the landscape. Wind farms tend to be in exposed open countryside and that is often landscape of great merit. Here are some cases of refusals by inspectors or the Secretary of State, since the start of 2009; Five 100m high wind turbines were rejected at a site in North Yorkshire primarily due to landscape harm and a serious adverse effect on residential amenity at a nearby farm. An inspector held that the landscape contributed to the areas distinctive character.27; A proposal for 12 wind turbines 145 metres high and a permanent meteorological mast in the Trent Valley was rejected, although the site lay within one kilometre of eight power stations and was crossed by pylon lines. The inspector held that the turbines would still have a significant effect on the surroundings.31; A proposal for a turbine with a blade tip of 25 metres in Somerset was rejected because it would affect an air traffic control centre.34 Other refusals have related to air safety at an airfield35 36.
