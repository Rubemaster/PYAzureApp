Consents for electricity generation were not historically a particular problem. The privatised electricity companies have been able to obtain consent for new gasfired power stations without particular complaint. However, increased emphasis upon renewable sources of power has resulted in planning problems. The result has been considerable delay and the rejection of many applications.;Not everybody would consider the delay or rejection of applications for wind farms to be a weakness. The planning system is meant to enable contrasting interests to be taken into account. Opponents of wind farms would say that some proposals would have damaged the landscape to a disproportionate extent and thus needed to be rejected.;A further consideration is that a disappointed applicant has the right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in practice to a planning inspector who will determine the application in line with Government guidance. Local planning authorities think hard before rejecting planning applications because they risk not only having their decision overturned on appeal but also having costs awarded against them if their decision is considered to be unreasonable. On the other hand there is a considerable delay before hearing an appeal, of perhaps a year. A considerable cost can be incurred as the result of such a delay.
