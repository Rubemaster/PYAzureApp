97. To help increase the use and supply of renewable and low carbon energy, local planning authorities should recognise the responsibility on all communities to contribute to energy generation from renewable or low carbon sources. They should;The National Policy Statement for Renewable Energy Infrastructure sets out the general principles that should be applied in the assessment of development consent applications for onshore wind (as well as other renewable energy technologies). Section 2.7 covers onshore wind. Key considerations for site selection are explained in detail and include predicted wind speed, proximity of site to dwellings, capacity of a site, access, grid connection issues, biodiversity and geological conservation, historic environment impacts, landscape and visual impact, noise and vibration, shadow flicker and traffic and transport issues.;In July 2013 the Government published Planning practice guidance for renewable and low carbon energy. This was replaced in March 2014 by online planning practice guidance on renewable and low carbon energy. The aim of this guidance was to make clear that the need for renewable energy did not automatically override environmental protections and the planning concerns of local communities. It also aimed to ensure sufficient weight was given to landscape and visual impact concerns. The guidance sets out particular planning considerations that relate to wind turbines. It includes guidance on how local planning authorities should assess impacts such as noise, safety, interference with electromagnetic transmission, ecology, heritage, shadow flicker, energy output, and cumulative landscape and visual impacts. It has been updated to take account of the new planning considerations announced
