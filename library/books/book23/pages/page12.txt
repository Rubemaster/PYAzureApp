Any locally set separation distance must not amount to a blanket ban for onshore wind.the Governments planning policy which would exclude the principle of a minimum separation distance. The inspector stressed that taking into account the specific topographical conditions for that area that an 800m distance would not be unreasonably excessive.14;The Inspectors report also focussed in detail on the national target to provide electricity from renewable sources and the evidence which suggested that great deal of Cumbrias renewable (and in particular wind) energy generating capacity either has already been constructed in Allerdale, or is awaiting construction in Allerdale having been granted planning permission.15 It examined the remaining locations where wind turbines might be sited in the area and the impact that locating turbines in these places would have on the landscape and the potential noise and visual harm considerations.;The inspector also looked at the potential effect of the separation distance to ensure that it would not, in practice, amount to a blanket ban. It was determined that in this particular location a distance of 800m would not amount to an inappropriate blanket ban. The report made clear that a separation distance which did amount in effect to a blanket ban would not be compatible with Government policy.16;There have been several legislative attempts to introduce an England wide separation distance, none of which have passed through all of the stages in Parliament to become law. The most recent attempt was by Lord Reay who introduced the Wind Turbines (Minimum Distance from Residential Premises) Bill HL 201213 in the House of Lords, but the Bill was not given time for second reading.
