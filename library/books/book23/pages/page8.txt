In March 2012 the Government published the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The NPPF sets out the Governments planning policies for England and how it expects these to be applied. It must be taken into account in the preparation of local and neighbourhood plans and is a material consideration for local planning authorities (LPAs) considering planning applications.;The NPPF replaced much of the former planning policy statements and the Localism Act 2011 and subsequent orders made under it have abolished all except for a few remaining policies of the Regional Spatial Strategies. In short, this now means that local planning authorities (LPAs) no longer have to adopt targets for wind farms set at regional level. They may, however, choose to adopt their own targets if they wish to do so.; approve the application if its impacts are (or can be made) acceptable. Once suitable areas for renewable and low carbon energy have been identified in plans, local planning authorities should also expect subsequent applications for commercial scale projects outside these areas to demonstrate that the proposed location meets the criteria used in identifying suitable areas.;91. When located in the Green Belt, elements of many renewable energy projects will comprise inappropriate development. In such cases developers will need to demonstrate very special circumstances if projects are to proceed. Such very special circumstances may include the wider environmental benefits associated with increased production of energy from renewable sources.
