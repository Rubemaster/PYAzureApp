The NSIP process has not yet been used to determine an onshore wind application in England. The new Government has indicated that onshore wind may be removed from the NSIP regime.;Planning applications for renewable energy projects, including onshore wind, above 50 megawatts (MW) are treated as Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs), under the rules provided for in the Planning Act 2008. NSIPs, rather than requiring planning permission need what is known as development consent.;For such projects, the Planning Inspectorate (either a single inspector or a panel) examines the application and will make a recommendation to the relevant Government Minister (for wind in England and Wales this is the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change), who will make the final decision in accordance with the National Policy Statements on Energy and any other matters that are relevant to the local area, including local plans. The process is timetabled to take approximately 12  15 months.;Before a NSIP development consent application can be submitted the developer is required to carry out extensive consultation on their proposals. This involves providing information about the proposal to various statutory and nonstatutory bodies and the wider community.1 More information about the process and who should be consulted is set out in Government guidance, Planning Act 2008 Guidance on the pre application process, January 2013.;To date, there have been no approvals of onshore wind farms through the NSIP system in England.2 Two forthcoming onshore wind farm project are currently expected to be over 50MW, the Keadby wind farm extension Lincolnshire and the Nocton Fen scheme, also in Lincolnshire. Formal application for these projects are expected to be submitted in 2016.3;The new Government has indicated that onshore wind may be removed from the NSIP system, with the decision making power returned to local authorities.4 For further information about this proposal see section 4 below.
