MCDA in Environmental Planning 603methods restricting the number of criteria should not be used in public decisionmaking. The role of the planner is emphasized in the choice of the multicriteria method to be used in aiding the decision process. As is widely known, different methods may give different solutions to the same problem, and DMs are rarely able to compare the methods. (This may happen only when the requirements of the method exceed what DMs consider realistic.) However, it is not possible to compare different methods reliably in a reallife problem. More insight into this problem will be gained when the number of reallife applications of different MCDA methods increases. Currently reallife MCDA applications are rare, but the number is increas ing quite rapidly. It should be noted that although the actual use of an MCDA method takes only a short time relative to the entire process, it defines the phases of the decision process through its data requirements. For example, our EIA procedures have each lasted about one year (except the Helsinki harbor application, which lasted two years), but the actual application of the MCDA method takes typically only a few weeks.;This research was supported, in part, by the Acad emy of Finland (58575), and the Technology Develop ment Centre Finland.
