For the case of Malta, no interview has been implemented. Below you may find the distribution of the nine risk categories and the related ranking of these, at a descending order, on the ground of risk premium estimation.;In the table next to the graph the model results are presented, showing the ranking order of the risk categories. Based on the model results, we used the estimated risk premium for the ranking of the model results. Unfortunately, no interview has been implemented for Malta.;According to the 2014 EWEA annual report, there is no wind energy plant installed in the region of Malta, up until 201347. On solarPV, Malta has 23 MW of installed capacity, which is translated to 54W of solarPV installed per habitant48. The European country average is equal to 88Whabitant, meaning that Malta is lagging behind on both solarPV and wind energy. Based on the aforementioned data, Malta is ranked 15th in the list of countries with the highest cumulative PV installed capacity per habitant and 20th regarding the total PV installed capacity. In addition, it is shown that the presence of RES technologies in the current national energy mix of Malta is currently the lowest in all Member States of the EU and the share of RES in gross final energy consumption is equal to 2.7, for the year 201249. For 2020, Malta has agreed on a 10 target of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption. This means that in the coming period, investments in renewable energy are expected. Based on the National Renewable Energy Plan, established in June 2010, Malta has set its 2020 national objectives on 28MW of photovoltaic, 14MW of onshore wind and 95MW of offshore50 (European Commission, 2010).;47 Wind in power  2013 European Statistics, EWEA (2014). 48 Global market outlook  For photovoltaics 20142018, EPIA (2014). 49 Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption .
