Interviewees mentioned that the risk categorisation is rather complete. Only one interviewee mentioned the resource risk as missing. Resource risk is being regarded as the risk of not meeting the wind yields estimated upfront, which can result in lower income and lower cash flows. Nonetheless, policies are able to account for these risks, as it could be a feature of their design.;Based on the answers, some conclusions can be drawn. First, the majority of the risk categories as presented in the table above were indicated as being an important risk. Only social acceptance risks and financing risks were not mentioned. Administrative risks, grid access risks and sudden policy change risks are indicated as being the most important by both the model and the interviewees. Administrative risks are considered to be more severe than grid access, as in Belgium grid access in the past has so far been fairly certain without many delays. However, this could change in the future with the increase of renewable energy penetration.;Next in the interviewees ranking was the sudden policy change risk. Sudden policy changes can have severe impact on investments, as doubts for the stability of existing legislation prevent the longterm commitment of investors. Any adverse changes in the legislation can affect future investment strategies, but not already operating projects.; This risk was not mentioned during the interviews (n3) The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
