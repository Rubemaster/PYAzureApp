The Renewable Energy Directive 200928EC lays down the legislative framework for renewable energy sources (RES) until 2020. The aim of the DiaCore project is to ensure a continuous assessment of existing renewable energy policy mechanisms and to establish a stakeholder dialogue for future policy needs.;1. Facilitate convergence in RES support across the EU. 2. Enhance investments and coordination between Member States.;It offers detailed crosscountry policy evaluations, presented in an interactive RES policy database. Future consequences of policy choices were analysed using the GreenX model, highlighting policy needs for 2020 target achievement and contributing to 2030 discussions.;In order to meet the 2020 EU targets on renewable energy, considerable investments are required from all Member States. For the EU, the total annual investments is estimated at 6070 billion per year4. From previous years, we know that this is possible, yet annual investments show a declining trend. In 2011, European5 investments in renewable power and fuels added up to almost 115 billion, but then decreased to 86 billion in 2012 and 48 billion in 2013 (REN21, 2015).;The specific investment costs of most renewable energy options are higher compared to fossil alternatives. The investment costs of wind energy projects, for instance, account for about 80 of the total costs, whereas investment costs for gas power represent about 15 (Waissbein, et al., 2013). As investments are required upfront before any income is generated, investors perceive these investments as risky.;4 Financing Renewable energy in the European Energy market, Ecofys, Ernst  Young, Fraunhofer ISI, TU Vienna, 2010. 5 Including nonEU countries and Russia.
