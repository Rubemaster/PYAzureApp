According to the interviewees, all risks categories are influencing the investments to some extent, although the influence of some is very small (e.g. social acceptance and sudden policy change). It was also mentioned that there is a clear distinction of the risk level between projects that are receiving fixed tariff (FIT) and those which are directly trading their energy into the market. The latter are accompanied by greater investment risk, as guaranteed remuneration result in less risky investment profile. For investments supported by the FIT scheme, market design and regulatory risk is the most important risk component, while for market remunerated RES power plants policy design risk is the most crucial risk factor.;In addition, the financing risk constitutes an important risk component. Administrative risk was also highlighted because of complicated and time consuming procedures for power plants licensing procedures. Moreover, the grid access risk is considered as important from all interviewees. No specific comment has been recorded for technical  management and sudden policy change risks. Finally, all experts agreed that social acceptance risk is the least influential risk component having a really low impact on the total RES investment profile.;Interviewees did score the effectiveness52 of Portugal policies to decrease investment risks with a score of 5 (n5). This is grounded on the fact that there is a clear overall framework regarding investments in the renewable energy sector.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
