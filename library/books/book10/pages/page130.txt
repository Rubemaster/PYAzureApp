 A range of 66.7 was accepted.; Based on the interviews, cost of debt should be lower. Noclear message from interviews, resulting in a large range.;DebtEquity ratio  For the beginning of the project the assumption of 7030 could be right, although for onshore wind 8020 is also observed. However, over the lifetime of the project, the leverage can change affecting the capital structure.;WACC  The opinions on the WACC differed between about right (n2) and far too high (n1). The interviewee that did not agree with the modelled WACC argued that we use a static model assuming a fixed capital structure (DebtEquity ratio), whereas in practice the gearing level for a project changes over time, including the WACC.;Cost of equity  There is a rather large spread in the cost of equity among our interviewees. The cost of equity will depend on the phase during operation it will be significantly lower than before financial close. Before permitting the cost of equity can be as high as 15, after permitting and before financial close it could be between 911 and during operation it could be as low as 810.;Cost of debt  For the cost of debt the opinions differ between too low (n1), about right (n1) and too high (n1). For the latter case, the interviewee points towards the current situation where bond and riskfree rates are at record lows. The markup has been pretty stable the last five years while it used to be lower before the crisis. Based on this, the interviewee estimates the cost of debt for wind onshore and PV to be around 33.5 and for wind offshore 4.5  5.5.
