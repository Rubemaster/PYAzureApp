In addition, the report of KPMG (2013) also pinpoints that the financial crisis in Europe has led to limited banking activities. According to the calculation model proposed by this study, the debt share was equal to 60 to 65 for offshore wind projects in Germany. The past gearing level of offshore wind projects had been sometimes higher than 80.;Based on the report of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (2013), current financial recession affects offshore wind industry in a direct way, as it decreases risk appetite among banks and overall liquidity. According to the analysis of Clean Energy Pipeline, a leverage ratio of 60 is assumed and stated that only the 23 of the new installed capacity will be partly funded by debt.
