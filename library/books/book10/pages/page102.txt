Wind energy development was stimulated by the implementation of feedin tariff system in Finland. The feedin tariff system was introduced in 2011 and during the last three years wind energy activities has increased a lot. Due to existing feedin tariff system the wind energy plants projects are not considered risky.;projects sponsors with high creditworthiness, investors canget even a higher share of debt. It could reach 8020 ratio.;DebtEquity ratio  For the beginning of the project the assumption of 7030 could be right, although for onshore wind 8020 is also observed. Profitability of the project has impact on the DebtEquity ratio. Creditability of the project developer (or rather the project sponsorowner, which may or may not be the same as the developer) is very important. The municipal energy companies can get the highest amount and cheapest debt, especially when they operate through so called mankala structure involving efficient distribution of risks between several energyindustrial companies as project sponsors.
