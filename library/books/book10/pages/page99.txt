The interest during construction exerts the highest influence on the DebtEquity ratio of a project.  WACC  The opinions of the interviewees differed on the WACC. One interviewee has estimated that the WACC should be lower than the estimated 6.4 because the estimated cost of debt is estimated too high. The other interviewee stated that the WACC should be higher, as the cost of debt has decreased significantly during the last years while the cost of equity increased. Therefore, the WACC should be about 1213. The interviewees did agree that the WACC is not changing depending on project size.
