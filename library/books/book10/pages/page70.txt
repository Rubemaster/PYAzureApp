Key results of the modelbased assessment of the impacts of improving financing conditions are summarised in the table below. More precisely, this table provides an overview on results concerning deployment and policy costs  i.e. RESrelated support expenditures  in the period up to 2020 and beyond (up to 2030). Impacts are shown for wind onshore, being in the spotlight for the risk evaluation performed.;Under BAU conditions, the switch from a real to an ideal WACC case shows a strong impact on wind onshore deployment the amount of electricity generated from wind onshore increases by slightly less than 2 up to 2020, and by about 3 up to 2030, while the corresponding support costs decrease by up to 3.1.;The scenarios of strengthened national policies (SNP) draw a different picture. The reduction of yearly support expenditures would be around 4.2 for the period until 2020, and 15.6 for the forthcoming decade.;Calculations based on the Green X Model show that if all countries would have the same renewable energy policy risk profile as the best in class, the EU Member States could reduce the policy costs for wind onshore by more than 1522. A reduced country risk could lead to greater savings.;22 These results are based on a hypothetical case, as they look at isolated RE risks profile changes. This indicative calculation aims to provide a first estimate of cost savings potential.
