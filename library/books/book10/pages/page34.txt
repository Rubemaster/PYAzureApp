The graph shows that, depending on the market development, different risks occur. Sudden policy change risks, for example, score much higher in nascent markets than in emerging and mature markets. In fact, the highly perceived risk of sudden policy changes might be an important reason why some nascent markets fail to turn into emerging markets a high risk of changing policy design might discourage project developers and equity providers to invest in these projects.;17 EWEA data on the onshore and offshore wind energy development was used (in absolute capacities, in relation to the overall consumption and in growth over the past three years), resulting in a ranking of Member States according to the maturity of their wind energy sector (see Annex G). Points from 0 to 10 were given for following factors The share of wind energy in overall electricity consumption, the average annual wind energy capacity increase in the period from 2011 to 2014 as well as the total installed capacity. Based on this ranking, the Member States were divided into three groups nascent markets (03 points), emerging markets (45 points) and mature markets (610 points).
