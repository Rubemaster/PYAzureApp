The level and variation of return on investment determines its financing structure and parameters, namely the equity share, return on equity and the lending interest rate. These financing parameters determine the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).;To gain insight into the relationship between policies and risks and cost of capital, a survey among developers, equity providers (i.e. project developers and bankers) was conducted. They were asked to indicate the level of selected financial parameters under different policy designs and indicate changes of these parameters if certain policy designs were changed. An online questionnaire was developed, tested and applied. The results were used to assess the risk exposure measured by means of WACC. The objective is to understand to which extent special policy designs mitigate risks from the perspective of investorsgenerators, i.e. shift risks from these actors to others.;Based on findings in literature, feedin schemes have been used for the assessment because the impact of design changes can be made very explicit for this support scheme and empirical experiences for different design variant exist in Europe. The latter aspect is very important to allow surveyed persons to give factbased responses. Changes in the feedin schemes influence the levels of price or market risks as well as risks of unanticipated expenditures or uncertainty on produced and market volumes. The selected policy designs are briefly described in Box 1. The modifications in the policy design focus on changes regarding level and variations of revenues. Moreover, uncertainties in expenditures are included as well.
