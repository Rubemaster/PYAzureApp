 Debt premium2 (Project Spread) 3 onshore wind, 3.5 PV, 4 offshore wind.;The Term Swap is defined as a fixed payment exchange for a floating payment that is linked to an interest rate (mostly LIBOR). In addition, the country risk is equal to the difference between the average tenyear national government bond interest rate and the respective interest rate of Germany. It is necessary to mention that tax savings are included into the cost of debt while it is calculated on an aftertax cost basis in the WACC formula. Finally, the Project Spread is the risk component related to the risk of a RES project that is incorporated into the calculation of the total cost of debt. This indicator constitutes the risk premium charged on loans by bank borrowers (UKERC, 2014) and, based on Mazars (2012), exceeds 3 for wind energy technology.;For the case of offshore wind technology, this risk premium generally shows 0.41 higher margins than that of onshore wind projects (Bloomberg, 2011).;About the project spread of PV, this range between the respective values of the two other renewable technologies, as Mintz Levin (2012) considers higher margins than these of the onshore wind energy. In the context of our analysis, we assume the following project spreads 3 onshore wind, 3.5 PV, 4 offshore wind.;As an example, a 138 MW wind energy project in Italy, in 2010, had a debt ratio equal to 78 and margins on the loans ranging between 2.62.9 (WEF, 2011).
