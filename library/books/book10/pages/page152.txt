In order to derive the historical equity risk premium, the returns of the market portfolio are compared to the returns of the riskfree rate. The most cited sources, include Aswath Damodaran, Ibbotson Associates and (Dimson, et al., 2006), report a big spread in equity risk premium estimates. This is due to variation in estimation inputs such as the market portfolio, riskfree rate, estimation period and frequency of estimation. For the purpose of this study we use the values obtained from surveys by (Fernandez, et al., 2012 Fernandez, et al., 2013), as depicted in Table 5 below. First the MRP values of 2013 were used and for the countries that this was not available the values of 2012 were used.
