 For a highly regulated asset it is around 45. But for windonshore it is bit higher which is close to 6.5. Regulation in; Wind onshore similar to PV 250300 basis points. Also riskfree rate rather high. CoD should be 0.51 lower.;DebtEquity ratio  For onshore wind the assumption of 7030 debt to equity ratio is correct although for UK a ratio of 8020 is also realistic. However, over the lifetime of the project, the leverage will change affecting the capital structure. Finally, with the CFD regime it is expected that the debt share could increase as the cash flows in the operating phase will become more stable, effectively reducing risk and favouring leverage.;WACC  Two interviewees commented on the WACC values. One mentioned that the WACC should be higher for onshore wind another that it is about right. The rationale behind the WACC value is that for a regulated asset it should be around 45. As wind onshore is not regulated and hence bit more risky than a regulated asset, a WACC of 6.5 is about right;Cost of equity  There is a rather large spread in the cost of equity among our interviewees. Firstly, the cost of equity will depend on the phase during operation it will be significantly lower than before connecting to the grid, without permits or during construction phase. For example if a project has not granted permits yet, then the CoE could be around 15. For a project ready to be built the CoE will be in the range of 10 9 depending on its characteristics. Finally an operational project would have a CoE between 9 and 7. Offshore wind will have a CoE around 2 higher than onshore wind.
