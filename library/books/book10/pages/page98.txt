According to interviewees all the main categories of the risks are included in the chart. Based on the results some conclusions can be drawn. First, all risks included into the model were mentioned at least once as being important risks. Second, interviewees agree that the main risk categories are administrative and policy design risks. Administrative procedures are very time consuming as many different institutions are involved in order to obtain all necessary permit for construction and grid connection. For some wind energy project administrative procedure took even 78 years. In recent years, ongoing political discussions has increased uncertainty and subsequently political design risk.;After administrative risk and policy design risk, interviewees consider technical  management risks and grid access risk most important. Financing risk, sudden policy change risk and social acceptance risk are expected to have the least influence on the cost of equity. In general the Estonian society is accepting renewable energy, therefore the risk is low. Finally, interviewees assume that the cost of equity is about 1520 depending on various aspects of the project and in general agree that the cost of equity is about 16.;Although renewable energy policy measures have remained unchanged so far, over the past three years possible changes have been discussed and preparation of legal memorandums have been performed. This have already changed the risk profile. Currently, a lot of discussions on this issue is ongoing. This creates uncertainty in the market, making banks reluctant to make investments with a long term perspective, such as renewable energy projects.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
