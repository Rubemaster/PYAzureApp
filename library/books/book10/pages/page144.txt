According to all interviewees the main risk for wind energy plants is their dependency on high electricity prices and that the existing support schemes do not provide sufficient support. This risk can be understood as a market design  regulatory risk or as a policy design risk. In any case it overshadows all other risks by far (90 of all risks). Right now, the electricity prices are too low and the quota system is not able to compensate for these low prices. As a consequence market experts expect reduced growth of wind energy and depreciation of existing projects.;Furthermore, some interviewees brought up the importance of timing in the risk assessment at what phase in the project are risks assessed? At the start of a project, risks like grid access, social acceptance and administrative risks might be relevant, but in terms of invested budget these risks are insignificant when compared to the construction and operation phase. During this phase (in which more than 90 of the overall budget has been invested) other risks such as the market design  regulatory risk become much more important. The interviewees showed in particular doubts with regard to the high amount for administrative risks. They pointed out that there are only few minor problems with corruption, and the bureaucracy is very business oriented in particular in comparison with countries and markets.;One interviewee also mentioned resource risk as another potential risk. However, that risk is also quite insignificant in comparison to the mentioned market design  regulatory risks.; This risk was not mentioned during the interviews (n3) The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
