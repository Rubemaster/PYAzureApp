The sliding FIP is used as base rate to which the changes in cost of capital are depicted. The yellow area in Figure 18 shows the fluctuating electricity market price. On top of this market price, a premium will be paid (blue area). The premium is capped to a maximum value (the strike price), meaning that it becomes smaller the more the market price augments. When the market price reaches the strike price, no premium will be paid. Therefore, the price risk exposure in the case of FIPs is low and linked to the premium setting formula. However, the volume risk is large, since the generators have to forecast and market their produced electricity. In the case of FIPs neg the price risk extends to periods in which the market price for electricity is negative. Therefore, revenues might drop to zero when generation exceeds demand.;Risk exposure is significantly higher under surplus capacities. Regarding the fixed FIP, the revenues fluctuate in line with the electricity price fluctuations as the premium paid (blue area) on top of the market price (yellow area) is fixed, i.e. independent from the electricity market price. Therefore, revenues are less certain and stable, as extreme fluctuations of revenues might occur (extremely high (profits) and low (losses) values). In contrast, the FIT ensures a stable and constant revenue (tariff) over the lifetime of the investment. There is no price risk and market risk. Finally, the FIPs tender displays the same price risks as the FIPs, but it also includes a risk of unforeseen costs, as a penalty (red area) is due if the operating start is delayed. The evaluation of this penalty could be considered as completion or construction risk as it might occur due to technical, management, supply or planning problems.
