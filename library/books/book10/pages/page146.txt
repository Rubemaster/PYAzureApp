 In United Kingdom, planning risk is considered to be as the most important. Planningrisk is associated with long administrative procedures.;Based on the results some conclusions can be drawn. First, almost all risk categories are mentioned at least once as being an important risk. Interviewees indicate administrative risks as the most important risk category, in contrast with the model. This risk category is mentioned as planning risk which is associated with long lead time of permitting during the development phase of the project. Administrative risks are particularly important because, as interviewees remark, they are very hard to manage.;The second most important risk according to the interviewees is policy design. While it is mentioned as a risk that should be taken into account in the assessment of the project, it is also expected not to be so important in the future under the CFD regime, as the contract is not going to be affected by policies. Combining the results obtained from both approaches we conclude that policy and administrative risks are the most important in the evaluation of a project. Grid access risk is also fairly important in UK, however this can be very site specific in some areas it is fairly easy to obtain access to the grid while elsewhere it can lead to severe delays.;For social acceptance risks it was mentioned that they are not negligible as indicated by the model. Particularly, social acceptance risks were indicated to be fairly important as this could cause delays in obtaining permits, and increase planning risk. Market design  regulatory risks were also mentioned to impact investment risk, however to a lesser extent than aforementioned risks.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
