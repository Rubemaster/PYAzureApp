This is a bit complicated but typical structure in Finland. More information is available at httpwww.ben.eepublicTuumakonverentsi20ettekanded202009Peter20S.20T reialt2020Mankala20principles.pdf  WACC  At the development stage risks are higher therefore the WACC should be higher than the estimated 6.7. At the project construction stage (already permitted projects) the WACC should be less than 6. At an advanced project development stage the WACC for onshore wind could be about 67, and for earlier stage projects much higher. Cost of equity  Interviewees assume that the cost of equity will depend on the phase of project implementation. At the project construction stage this year the cost of equity is below 10 for wind energy projects. For another renewable energy sources the cost of equity is higher than 10. At the project development stage it is much higher. 1115 would refer to a project in a rather advanced stage of development. Cost of debt.  Banks usually provide debts for the 1012 years as feedin tariff for wind energy is ensured for twelve years. Riskfree rate 1 (based on ten year Finnish bond rate). Margin  3. Cost of debt  4 (pretax). This should apply also to project finance debt on nonrecourse basis. Municipal energy companies, especially when using so called mankala structure can get even lower risk premium and in such case the cost of debt could be about 3 (pretax). For ten years debt 56 is too high should be about 35.
