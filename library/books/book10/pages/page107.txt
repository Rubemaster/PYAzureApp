 The established feedin tariff has provided secure investment conditions. Theintroduction of a premium scheme has reduced that security.;The two risks that were mentioned by all interviewers were the technical risks (mainly as resource risks) and the policy design risks. Administrative risks (such as regional rules on distance regulations and general development risks) were also mentioned. Grid access risks were not considered as pressing as expected in case of onshorewind energy.;The majority of interviewees pointed at resource (or elementary risks) as one of the main risks for onshore wind energy projects in Germany to be missing. Although interviewees suggest to integrate this under the category of technical  management risks, we have included this under policy design risk. The reason for this is that wind yield is a risk that cannot be influenced by the project developer. Yet, to make sure that this does not affect their willingness to invest in wind energy, this risk should be addressed somewhere. The only place where this can be addressed is the policy design.;Furthermore, some interviewees brought up the importance of timing in the risk assessment at what phase in the project are risks assessed? At the start of a project, risks like grid access, social acceptance and administrative risks are very relevant, but in terms of invested budget the risks is insignificant when compared to the construction and operation phase. During that phase other risks such as technicalmanagement will become more important. The focus again changes when the support scheme expires and the plant has to sell its electricity on the free market. At that moment market design and regulatory risks become very important. In the model, risks were estimated at the beginning of the project, before financial close.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
