RES investments are influenced and impacted by several risks categories. Apart from the country risk, the policy design risk is ranked as one of the most severe risks. An important part of the policy design is the support scheme to increase the costprice competitiveness between renewable energy and fossil alternatives. In ten Member States, policy design is ranked as the most important risk. Other risks frequently mentioned in the top3 risk categories are administrative risks (including permit procedures), market design  regulatory risks (including energy strategies and market deregulation), and grid access risks. In Member States where national governments introduced retroactive measures to support schemes (e.g. Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Spain), the risk of sudden policy change was ranked very high, too.;Countries from the same region or with similar market development or technology deployment status display a similar risk perceptionprofilestatus. For example, in Southern European markets, financing risks are very pressing, while the sudden policy change risk category appears in the top3 for many Eastern European Member States (Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovenia, Latvia and Slovakia).;Social acceptance risks rank the highest in NorthWestern countries. The market design  regulatory risk also seems to be more important in NorthWestern countries, which could indicate that current market design and regulations are no longer fulfilling the needs of the RES developers in the region.;In developing onshore wind markets, administrative risks are particular relevant. Administrative risks, grid access risk and technical  management risks are perceived most relevant in emerging markets, while policy design risks are ranked relatively low in comparison to nascent and mature markets.
