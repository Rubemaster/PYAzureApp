The interviewees indicated two risk categories to be missing resource risk and construction risk. Resource risk is being regarded as the risk of not meeting the wind yields estimated upfront, which can result in lower income and lower cash flows. Policies are able to account for these risks as it could be a feature of their design. For instance, if wind yields in the first years are more than 25 lower than expected, this could influence the cash flows and business case negatively. However, under the current Dutch subsidy scheme certain measures are taken to cover for this (i.e. wind factor, banking). Construction risk is associated with any uncertainties during construction phase and are included in the technical  management risks.;Based on the results some conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, almost all risk categories are mentioned at least once as being an important risk. Policy design and administrative risks were indicated as being most important in both model and the interviews. Different is that in the model policy design risks were estimated to have a higher impact than administrative risks. On the contrary, during one of the interviews it was mentioned that Policy design is in fact not considered a risk, as Policy design only defines the rules of the game. The investor can either agree with this or not. We therefore concluded that the influence of policy design on the cost of equity should indeed be lowered.;Next in rank, interviewees identify social acceptance risks. On the impact of this risk opinions differed, merely caused by the type of projects that the interviewees had experience with. Offshore wind creates very little public opposition as compared to onshore wind. The impact of the opposition against onshore wind though, varies between regions.; This risk was not mentioned during the interviews (n5) The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
