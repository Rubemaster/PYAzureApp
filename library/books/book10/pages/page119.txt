WACC  In Italy, the WACC of wind assets is typically higher than PV due to higher uncertainty of production and to a lower debt to equity ratio. This indicator depends, at a descending order, on the country of implementation, the specific renewable technology and the project size (small or large scale). Moreover, the degree of saturation of these technologies is considered from the interviewees as an important factor too. In addition, the global economic crisis is critical as this factor also impacts the level of implementation of RES investments at a certain degree. Regarding a largescale PV plant, this investment has lower risk as onshore wind farms are more risky due to lower social acceptance.;Cost of equity  Regarding the level of this indicator, the feedback obtained was rather divided. Specifically, the majority of the experts stated that a range of 1213 (close to the modelled value) is realistic. On the other hand, a range of 1012 or even 9, has been assumed from another interviewee. Moreover, all participants mentioned that large scale PV plants have identical or slightly lower cost of equity than those of the onshore wind energy plants. This difference is grounded on the higher uncertainty of production and the greater risk occurred during the development and construction phases of a wind energy project.;Cost of debt  Based on the feedback of two interviewees, the cost of debt is lower for the case of a PV project. Another expert stated that the extracted range of values (7.9 8.4) represents a technically optimal project. Thus, a range of 810 is more representative and an average value of 9 can be assumed. About the renewable project spread, at the moment, it is equal to 4 for PV power plants and slightly higher for wind because of the greater uncertainty of production and operation.
