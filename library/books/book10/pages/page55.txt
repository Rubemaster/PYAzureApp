The policy toolbox was created with input from both the onshore wind investments risks and cost of capital assessment as well as the impact of support scheme changes on the cost of capital assessment. In the interviews for the onshore wind investments risks and cost of capital assessment we addressed the effectiveness of current policies in reducing project risks and how this could be improved. This information is used in the policy toolbox. Additionally, the feedback gathered from the online questionnaire (see section 6) and workshops (organised as part of the DiaCore projects) were used. These outcomes are therefore very important to give an indication on the effect of policy measures on the business case.
