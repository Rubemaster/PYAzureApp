Interviewees did score the effectiveness32 of Cypriote policies to decrease investment risks with a mean score of 3 (n3). Two of the interviewees stated that existing policies have high efficiency on the reduction of the total investment risk but the two others mentioned moderate or low effort to this result. According to the interview outcomes, the investment in RES sector, especially solarPV plants, is considered as the safest investment option in Cyprus.;During the first half of current decade, several policy changes were implemented having both positive and negative effects. The introduction of a netmetering system (for small PV systems) had a positive effect on RES investments while the replacement of the previous FIT support scheme by auctioning had a negative effect. As auctioning system led to lower selling price of renewable electricity produced it became less attractive for private investors in Cyprus and reduced the risk from the government perspective. Also the introduction of new grid fees and connection fees, as well as an increase of the tax rate for companies from 10 to 12.5, resulted in policyrelated changes that negatively affected investments in the renewable energy sector.; For PV, this value is considered to be high. Now, for all RESproject a range of 812 is more representative.; One interviewee mentioned that it is really high.
