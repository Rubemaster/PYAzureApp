The introduction of auctions in the renewable energy market (excluding PV), in July 2012, has led to an increase of risk up to approximately 1.5. In addition, the unstable policy framework has not been supportive for further development of RES investments. Lastly, the regulatory risk has been affected by the cap limit that was put to be paid on RES investments.; The other expert stated that for onshore wind it is 8.59,for PV projects is close to 7. No offshore wind energy plant;for PV projects is close to 7. No offshore wind energy plantin operation.;DebtEquity ratio  A debtequity ratio of around 7030 is generally considered as realistic one, although a ratio of 6535 might be closer to the current situation. For the case of wind energy plants, this ratio is generally lower than for PV power plants. The factors that exert the highest influence on the DE ratio are the existing economic crisis, the availability of funds from banks, the ease of accessing public funds, the stability of incentives and, for large scale investments, the degree of acceptance from the social perspective. Specifically, the liquidity of the bank system, their appetite and policies of banks are considered as the most intense and highly influential factors on the debtequity ratio.
