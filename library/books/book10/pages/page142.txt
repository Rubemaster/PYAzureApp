All interviewees have mentioned that there is no risk component missing from the analysis. The interview participants agreed that policy design risk is considered to be the most important risk component, affecting the entire risk profile of the country. Sudden policy change and market design  regulatory risks were identified as considerable risk components and interacting with each other. Also administrative risk, related to bureaucracy of permitting procedures, is considered to be a considerable risk. According to most interviewees financing risk has minimal influence on the cost of equity, while another interviewee indicate this as being one of the most important risks. Grid access risk is estimated to have a low impact. Finally, technical  management and social acceptance risks are referred as the least important factors influencing the national investment risk profile. Specifically, the latter is present only for onshore wind energy plants.;As interviewees mentioned that policy changes occurred over the past five years have led to a total increase of investment risks in the RES sector. As a result, the effectiveness of current energy policy is considered negative and no ranking on the mentioned scale 15 has been recorded (value out of scale).;In 2007, the FITFIP schemes and remuneration levels were updated. As these support mechanisms provided very good conditions, they have led to an extensive development of RES projects and, in some cases, overcompensation of RES producers. In 2010, the Spanish government retroactively changed the remuneration level provided which negatively affected RES investors. Since 2012, FITFIP remuneration has no longer provided to new RES projects and, during the last two years, no new RES projects have been implemented until now.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
