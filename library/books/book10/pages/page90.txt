The fee to encourage the production of electricity from renewable energy sources and CHP (Naknada za poticanje elektrine energije iz obnovljivih izvora energije i kogeneracije) for final consumers (financing of feedin tariff) was increased sevenfold in 2013 and currently accounts for 0.46 ctkWh29. The RES contribution is a fee collected by all electric utilities and passed on to the Croatian Energy Market Operator (HROTE). After that HROTE pays the contribution to qualified producers for the RES electricity fed into the network.;In October 2013, the Government adopted the National Action Plan for RES30, which restrict RES development through a cap on capacities (in particular for wind and solar power). The proposal foresees by 2020 20.1 on the share of renewable sources in final energy consumption. Furthermore, the action plan suggests that between 2015 and 2020 the installed capacities of solar and wind energy shall not further increase and would thus remain at their current levels 52 MW of solar PV and 400 MW wind. A relatively small amount of growth is planned in hydro power (reaching up to 2158 MW), geothermal (reaching up to 10 MW) and biomass energy (reaching up to 125 MW).;According to the National Acton Plan, a new Tariff System for Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources and CHP (NN 1332013)31 was adopted and come into effect on 1 January 2014. It requires several changes to the system of the calculation and amount of the feedin tariff, it clarifies a number of legal terms, and it defines requirements for skilled workers in the field of RES installations and maintenance. Moreover, the changes aim to accelerate the administrative procedure and remove barriers for concluding a contract with the Croatian Energy Market Operator (HROTE) in order to become a qualified producer.; 7030 DE ratio is reasonable. This ratio is used forcalculation for the purchase price for RES.;29 Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources and Cogeneration  httpnarodne novine.nn.hrclancisluzbeni2013101282778.html 30 Ministry of Economy (2013) National Renewable Energy Action Plan  www.vlada.hrhrcontentdownload2752634062911file120.20202.pdf 31 The Tariff System for Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources and CHP  httpnarodne novine.nn.hrclancisluzbeni2013111332888.html
