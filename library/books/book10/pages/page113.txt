The two risks that were mentioned by all interviewees were the policy design risk and the sudden policy change risk. Grid access risks (e.g. refusal of grid connection or curtailment) and market design  regulatory risks were also mentioned.;According to stakeholders, the policy design risk is mainly caused by the fact that he Hungarian RES sector has been waiting for years for a new feedin tariff scheme with more favourable tariffs and different conditions to replace the current feedin tariff scheme. However, the legal amendments have been repeatedly delayed and it is still unclear if or when the support system could be amended.;With regard to grid access risks, new wind energy projects have been put on hold. According to the current procedure, the maximum grid capacity for wind energy has been limited at 310 MW. As this limit has already been reached, only wind project for own consumption can be realised. With regard to PV installations, this grid access risk is less relevant, since PV projects do not have to undergo the tendering procedure to receive the feedin tariff.;The interviewees agreed that the Hungarian government has not been able to reduce investment risks for RES developers due to the fact that the RES sector is still waiting for the implementation of the new feedin tariff scheme (METAR) to replace the old feedin tariff scheme (KAT). The high political risk (also concerning possible retroactive changes) constitutes a severe barrier for the further development of the Hungarian RES sector.; This risk was not mentioned during the interviews (n2) The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
