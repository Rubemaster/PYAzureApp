These and other questions are answered in this chapter. Besides risks, the focus will be on the financial parameters for RES investments.;Based on the data gathered through literature, modelling and interviews, country risk profiles have been prepared. These profiles can be found in Annex A.;14 The highest ranked risk per Member State was awarded 8 points, while the lowest ranked risk received 1 point. In countries where not all 8 risk categories were reported, the 8 points were evenly distributed between the present risk categories (e.g. in case only 5 risks were reported, the highest risk received 8 points, the second 6.4, the third 4.8, the fourth 3.2 and the lowest risk 1.6 points). Subsequently, we calculated for each of the three regional groups as well as the entire EU28 the average value per risk category.
