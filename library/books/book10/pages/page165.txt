In our project we tried to model this. We identified nine risk categories that we assume would be influencing the cost of equity. The figure below shows a possible decomposition for a RES project in the Netherlands. At the far left we depicted the baseline rate and at the far right the cost of equity before derisking. The differences between the rates are caused by nine risk categories.
