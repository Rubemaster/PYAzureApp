Cost of debt is the total amount of interest paid by an entity so as to borrow money. The lenders, who provide funds, will require higher returns for financing more risky investments. Hence, the higher the probability of the borrower to default on his payments, the higher will be his cost of debt. This indicator can be modelled by adding a risk premium to the riskfree rate so as to account for the perceived risk.;Debt providers demand an interest in order to lend their money which depends on the perceived riskiness of the respective company or project. The cost of debt is the effective interest rate that a company pays for its total debt. As credit providers require higher compensation for facing more risk, the cost of debt rises with the perceived risk of the project.;This chapter aims to identify the cost of debt for renewable energy projects among EU Member States. The concentration is on three RES technologies, onshore wind, offshore wind and PV. For the purposes of this study, we have implemented two different approaches to calculate cost of debt. The first one is based on a report published by Eurelectric (2012) and the second one on a study of Bloomberg (2011). These two approaches are elaborated in the following chapters accompanied by a comparison of the two methods and an investigation of the existing literature.
