The graph also shows differences between the regions, the biggest difference being the financing risk category financing is not a big issue in the NorthWest region, but for the Southern countries this is perceived as the most pressing risk after policy design. The financial crisis in the last years has had a severe effect in particular on Southern European countries. The crisis reduced access to loans and makes wind energy investments more risky in regions that have been hit by the financial crisis. This risk increases the costs of financing, and thus the LCOE of wind energy projects with a high CAPEX, as CAPEX constitutes the main part in the LCOE of onshore wind energy projects.
