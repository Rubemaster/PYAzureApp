system in Finland. Due to existing feedin tariff system the wind energy plants projectsare not considered risky.;Based on the results some conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, almost all risk categories are mentioned at least once as being an important risk. Interviewees state that market and regulatory risks, technical  management risks, administrative risks and policy design risks are the most important categories of risks. When comparing the importance of risks interviewees suppose that in general the impact of market and regulatory risk would be as high as access to grid. There should be also some policy design risk. Administrative risk seems to be too high for Finland and technical  management risk seems to be quite low comparing to other risks. Grid access risk to some extent also should have impact on the cost of equity. According to the interviewees the influence of these risks on the cost of equity are depending on the development stage of the project.;In the beginning of a project, both administrative risks and social acceptance are very important, while in later stages these risks are negligible. Administrative risk (to obtain permits) is very high for wind project in Finland at the project development stage. Policy design risk are expected to be higher at the development stage as the total installed capacity for wind energy is capped at 2500 MW, while currently a lot of projects are under development. Therefore policy design risk should be higher and market designregulatory risk lower. At the project construction stage this changes grid access risk and technical  management risk will become lower and social acceptance risk and policy design risk are not regarded a risk factor anymore.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
