Step 2  Wind onshore investments risks and cost of capital in the EU28 Member States the results of the theoretical model are tested and evaluated per Member State. By sharing the results with financial experts, feedback is gathered on the completeness of risk categories, the influence of the risks, the role and effectiveness of policy in reducing investment risks. Furthermore, assumptions used to construct the model are tested.;Step 3  Impact of support scheme changes on the cost of capital the role and influence of policy on decreasing investment risks is analysed in more detail. To gain insights in the role of policy, an online questionnaire was created in which respondents were asked how financial parameters will change under different policy schemes. The reference case is a typical onshore wind project supported by a FeedIn Premium (FIP) policy scheme. By changing the policy scheme to nonsliding FIP, fixed FIP, tender with policy, and FeedIn Tariff, insights are obtained in the influence of policy schemes on cost of capital (i.e. cost of debt, cost of equity, Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)).
