The first result is a huge gap between EU Member States Germany has the lowest WACC in the EU28, with a value of 3.54.5 for onshore wind energy projects. From an investors perspective Germany thus provides a low risk environment for onshore wind energy investments, which enables investments with relatively low capital costs. The other extreme in the EU are Croatia and Greece, where circumstances are less favourable, showing WACCvalues that can be more three times as high as in Germany.;In between, there is a large number of Member States with WACCvalues twice and three times as high as Germany. This huge difference can be explained by the fact that, in all factors of the WACC calculation, the German case is the most favourable with a lower risk premium and both costs of debt as well as equity being much lower. Moreover, the relatively lowrisk environment in Germany allows for a higher share of (lower) debts in the WACC, thereby further reducing the value. According to interviewees, another important reason is the fierce competition between banks that significantly reduces the cost of debt.;The effects of such high WACCvalues are remarkable, especially when taking into account the fact that capital expenditure is the main cost factor for wind energy projects. High capital costs directly result in higher cost of electricity for wind energy project developers, who require higher tariffs to have a viable business case.
