Step 1  Theoretical model estimating the cost of debt, equity, and capital the perspective of a project developer as a first step, a theoretical model is constructed to estimate the influence of risks on renewable energy investments for individual Member States. This model helps provide insights in the scale of the investment risks per Member State (MS) and which risks are perceived as most relevant. This step results in a first version of the country risk profiles. In order to construct these profiles, we have;Step 1  Theoretical model estimating the cost of debt, equity, and capital the perspective of a project developer as a first step, a theoretical model is constructed to estimate the influence of risks on renewable energy investments for individual Member States. This model helps provide insights in the scale of the investment risks per Member State (MS) and which risks are perceived as most relevant. This step results in a first version of the country risk profiles. In order to construct these profiles, we havea. Identified risk categories influencing investment decisions (mainly based on;b. Obtained insights in financial models and parameters that influence investmentdecisions. For each Member State, the model estimates the cost of equity, reflecting the investment environment;decisions. For each Member State, the model estimates the cost of equity, reflecting the investment environmentc. Divided the cost of equity over the risk categories (based on literature and studies),;c. Divided the cost of equity over the risk categories (based on literature and studies),resulting in a ranking of risk categories for each MS.
