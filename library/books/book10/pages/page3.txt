Looking specifically at the cost of equity, which is the remuneration for equity providers for making capital available, we also see significant differences in the EU. The cost of equity for onshore wind projects ranged between 6 (Germany) and more than 15 in Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia in 2014. The level of cost of equity is often influenced by risk perception of investors. In countries such as Germany where renewable energy policy is anchored in the renewable energy act, approved by law, and proved to be very reliable and credible over a long time period, the cost of equity is low. In economically and politically less stable countries where renewable energy is not yet mainstream or embedded in a reliable support policy, the cost of equity is higher.;Finally, the cost of debt (which is the remuneration for debt providers  such as banks  for making capital available) varied between 1.8 in Germany and 12.6 in Greece in 2014. According to investors, the main factors for the cost of debt value are the general country risk, the specific renewable investment risks and also the (lack of) competition between debtors.
