Croatia has set its RESE target at 20 renewable energy consumption in 2020. The share of renewable energy in total energy consumption increased over the past years from 14.1 in 2005 to 15.5 in 2013. In the table below, the total installed capacity of RES power plants is presented (November 2014)27;In Croatia, renewable energy generation is supported mainly through a feedin tariff for eligible producers (qualified producers)28. Additionally, the Croatian Bank for Development and Reconstruction (HBOR) and the Fund for Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency operate a loan scheme or nonreimbursement incentives for RESE projects. These incentives have been in place since 2004 and are renewed every December, building on the experiences and results of the previous year.;Due to accession to the EU some of RES support schemes were amended. In April 2013, the Economic Programme of Croatia was presented, with the Government committing itself to promote investments in energy efficiency and energy renovation of buildings, renewable energy sources, and technologies with low greenhouse gas emissions (in particular for the development of heating systems, heat pumps, biomass generation plants).;27 Croatian energy market operator (HROTE) httpwww.hrote.hr 28 The Tariff System for Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources and CHP  httpnarodne novine.nn.hrclancisluzbeni201206631508.html
