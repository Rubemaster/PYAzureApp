The discount rate is determined by the investor upfront and varies depending on the type of investment and the associated risk. A high discount means that investors aim to receiver a high return on their investment to compensate for the risk of investing in the project. In this study, the discount rate is therefore used as a proxy for risk. Although risks can have both a positive and negative impact, in the context of this study, the focus is on the negative deviation of the actual returns from the expected returns.;From an investors point of view, the main goal of investing is to maximise the return. In general, investors strive to minimise risks, but are willing to accept risks if these are compensated with a higher return rate.;Risks associated with RES development are widely described in literature Ecofys (2008), Justice (2009), Waissbein, et al. (2013), Ragwitz, et al. (2007), IEARETD (2010).;These studies identify and categorise possible sources of risk that can influence future results and thus investors decisions about whether or not to invest in RES projects. Based on these studies, nine risk categories have been identified, namely country risk, social acceptance risk, administrative risk, financing risk, technical  management risk, grid access risk, policy design risk, market design  regulatory risk and sudden policy change risk. These nine categories describe a large array of risks, covering the development process of RES projects, as presented in Figure 3.
