The sample used consists of 52 RES European companies that are either pure play (companies that have or very close to single business focus) or that achieve 50 percent of their revenues in the renewable energy industry. An empirical investigation by (KPMG, 2013) showed that 68 percent of the surveyed companies (from Germany, Austria and Switzerland) applied a peer group Beta for the value in use, and 88 percent of the companies derived the Beta for their fair value determination from peer groups.;By using a large amount of representative companies in peer group analysis the estimation error is minimised providing more reliable results. Additionally, it allows determining a representative value for the Beta factor, accounting for the debt to equity ratio and tax rates. This is done by using Hamadas equation (Hamada, 1972);The levered or the regression Beta is first unlevered taking into account the capital structure of the sample companies. Afterwards, it is relevered, to represent the capital structure and the tax rate specific to every country.;In order to estimate the Beta for every peer company, choices for the frequency, the sample period and the market portfolio are made. Specifically, monthly returns are used for the estimation. Monthly returns circumvent the illiquidity problem that can arise by using weekly or daily returns. The sample period is four and five years of data providing a sample big enough for statistically significant results.;This choice is in line with the common practise of companies as according to a report survey by (KPMG, 2013), 50 of companies listed in the DAX30 index used a multiyear Beta for a period of four years. Finally, the market portfolio is represented by the MSCI ACWI All59 cap equity index which covers 23 developed and 23 emerging markets and constitutes of nearly 14 thousand stocks. This broad index is considered an adequate representation of the behaviour of the market as whole.
