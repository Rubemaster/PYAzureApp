According to the interviewed stakeholders, financing, administrative and policy design risks are the most important risk components. Financing renewable energy projects in Cyprus is currently difficult because of the countrys financial situation and the suspension of grants and subsidies to stimulate renewable energy investments. Also administrative risk is a more structural problem, as permitting procedure has shown significant delays.;Interviewees mentioned examples of permitting procedures for PV plants that have lasted for more than three years. Regarding the influence of policy design risk, the interviewed stakeholders do not fully agree with each other. They do agree that the abolition of the FIT support scheme has had a negative influence, yet the degree of this impact was ranging between high and moderate. The market design and regulatory risks are considered to be comparable with the modelled results, followed by grid access risk. In Cyprus the costs for grid access are paid by project developers.;In addition, the distance between the sitting point of the RES power plant and the grid electricity network has been a critical criterion for the permission of these projects. All interviewees agreed that technical  management and social acceptance risks are the least important risk factors with a minimal impact on the cost of equity.;The majority of the interviewees considered that this risk component analysis is complete and no other risk component currently exists in Cyprus. Nevertheless, one energy expert mentioned several other risks such as environmental risks, extreme weather conditions, period of project implementation, qualified technical labour for installation and drawingmaintain investments in the renewable energy sector.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
