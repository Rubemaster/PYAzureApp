Numerous changes of the national renewable energy policy have been implemented during the last five years leading, in general, to an increase of the total risk of renewable energy investments. More specifically, in the past five years considerable and frequent changes of the legislative framework were made, mainly regarding regulatory issues. In 2009, the taxation applied to the operators significantly increased, at a rate of 50, leading to a decline of their revenues. In 2010, the legislative framework has been altered and a new permit was introduced regarding the construction and operation of a wind farm. This permit made the procedure more complex and caused permitting procedures to change constantly.;Also in 2010, a rise in taxation of about 10 for developers has been made as well as a series of alterations in the electricity grid connection. In 2011, two new support schemes for planning wind farms and network planning were established. In 2013, another change of permitting procedures was implemented, however, not to every region in the country. Specifically, wind farms of less than five wind turbines are currently not permitted and, in 2015, new permits are specified for all regions of France. Finally, a change of costs for connection to the grid has been occurred.
