One interviewee stated that the cost of equity for an onshore wind project is about 16, the other interviewee suggested a range of cost at about 1520.;Cost of debt  Interviewees have a unified opinion regarding modelled cost of debt. They assume that estimated cost of debt is too high. However, opinions of interviewees diverged when they provided suggested cost of debt.
