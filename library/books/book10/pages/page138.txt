The two risks that were mentioned by all interviewees were the grid access risk and the policy design risk. The stakeholders agreed that the grid access risk had the highest impact on RES projects in Slovakia. Currently, no new PV or wind energy projects receive a grid connection permit. One interviewee pointed out that the regulator refuses to connect new RES projects to the grid, even though it would be technically feasible. According to the interviewed stakeholders, this connection moratorium was a purely political decision.;Due to the unstable legal conditions in Slovakia as well as the unpredictability of the state regulators decisions they both also mentioned the policy design risk and the sudden policy change risk. Administrative risks were considered as minor risk category. This however, is mainly due to the fact that RES projects do not even reach the stage of implementation where administrative issues could present a risk for developers.;Both interviewees agreed that the recent energy policy measures in Slovakia only increased the risks for renewable energy investors. Especially the connection moratorium for PV and wind energy power plants, which will presumably also be in place for most of 2015, has stopped the development of the entire Slovak RES market and has deterred most foreign investors. The state regulator had announced that there were no free grid capacities for PV and wind energy plants with capacities above 10 kW.; This risk was not mentioned during the interviews (n2) The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
