10.8  Interviewees agree that the modelled value is about right.;55.5  Cost of debt should be a bit lower, 55.5.;DebtEquity ratio  The opinions on the DebtEquity ratio for an onshore wind farm differ among interviewees between 8020 (n1) and 7030 (n2). However, one of the interviewees (who supported the 7030 ratio) mentioned that for large companies the equity share could be less. Despite the disagreement on onshore wind, all interviewees would agree that for offshore wind project the debtequity share is 7030. Specifically, it was mentioned that banks are more conservative than they used to be and more reluctant to lend money for project financed projects unless higher mark ups are accepted such as liquidity premium.;Cost of equity  Two interviewees provided their input for the CoE agreeing on the estimated value of the model. Both interviewees also agreed that, for offshore wind project, the cost of equity should be about 23 higher. For a PV project, one interviewee commented that the CoE should be 23 lower as the procedures required are more straightforward for PV than for onshore wind.;Cost of debt  For the cost of debt, interviewees estimated that the model assumption was too high. Specifically, for onshore wind and PV project, the CoD should be 200 basis points above the riskfree rate (or 55.5 in total) and for off shore wind it should be around 300350 basis points. Overall, the spread depends on the characteristics of the project such as the duration of the support mechanism, the regulatory framework, the system in every country, the investment environment and the location (wind yield, foundation, operation and management).
