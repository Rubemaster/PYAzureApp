important. For the other risks, interviewees agree that they are less relevant theaforementioned risks, but they are not totally irrelevant.; The cost of equity could be assumed as of 16.6, cost of debt should be about 6.;In the table next to the graph the model results are compared to the interview results, showing the ranking order of the risk categories. For the ranking we used two different indicators for the model results we used the estimated risk premium and for the interview results we used the frequency that risk categories were indicated as most important41. The interviewees agreed that all potential categories of risks influencing on cost of equity of renewable energy projects in Lithuania are covered by the study.;Based on the results some conclusions can be drawn. First, all risks included in the model were mentioned as important risks by the interviewees. Second, estimations of risks are the highest for the risk categories policy design risk and social acceptance risk. For the other risks, interviewees agree that they are less relevant the aforementioned risks, but they are not totally irrelevant.;Sudden policy change risk, technical  management risk, market design  regulatory risk are still important and influence the cost of equity considerably. These risks are then followed by administrative risk and grid access risk, for which is assumed that their influence is only small. Financing and grid access risks are assumed to be least important and influence the cost of equity not significantly.;41 In many cases more than one risk categories were indicated as most important. In those cases, we have included the top3 risks in the ranking.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
