 For PV, the model value is fine. Although, for large scale PVpower plants should be lower.;Based on the 2014 EWEA annual report and the interviewees response, the total onshore wind installed capacity is currently equal to 2MW and there is limited experience about this technology54. In addition, there is no offshore wind energy plant under operation. Moreover, the cumulative PV installed capacity is 212MW, with a ratio of 103Whabitant55.;Based on the aforementioned data, Slovenia is ranked 8th in the list of countries with the highest cumulative PV installed capacity per habitant and 16th regarding the total PV installed capacity. Regarding the renewable energy targets set for 2020, Slovenia has agreed to install 106MW of onshore wind capacity and 139MW of PV capacity56. Based on the figures mentioned above, the PV target has already been achieved. There are no plans for the development of offshore wind energy in Slovenia.;54 Wind in power  2013 European Statistics, EWEA (2014). 55 Global market outlook  For photovoltaics 20142018, EPIA (2014). 56 National Renewable Energy Action Plan 20102020 (NREAP) Slovenia, Ljubljana, July 2010, European Commission (2010).
