Based on studies before current financial crisis, the proportions of debt and equity in the whole capital expensed on a RES project were 80 and 20, respectively. Nevertheless, it is considered that, during the financial crisis, the debt level has been reduced, reaching 70 in the post financial crisis era. According to MAZARS (2012), the debt share in onshore wind energy projects in United Kingdom, used to be greater than 80 and showed a slight decrease in 2009 and 2012, at approximately 75. Klessmann, et al. (2013) also stated that the gearing level has changed after the induction of financial crisis, as the 8020 debt to equity ratio has altered to 7030.;Relevant studies include Knpek  Vacek (2009) who assume debt to equity ratio equal to 6040 for a representative case of wind energy project in Czech Republic. Similar was the proportion of debt in onshore wind projects in Greece. According to YPEKA (2012) debt accounted for 60 into the total funding of onshore wind and PV projects. For the case of offshore wind energy plants, and according to (EWEA, 2013), the current debt share for the majority of offshore wind farms ranges between 60 and 70. Based on this study, the cost of finance through debt is highly correlated with the current macroeconomic factors trend and existing liquidity limitations in the banking market.
