One reason for this might be that in nascent markets, the issue of a functioning and reliable support scheme has to be resolved first. Once in place, wind energy projects can be actually planned. At this stage, new risks become apparent, such as underdeveloped administrative procedures and lack of experience of wind energy developers, public authorities andor grid operators. With the development of projects, all actors gain experience and learn how to cooperate. As a consequence the ranking of administrative and grid access risks decreases, while the market shows a more rapid development and grows more mature.;In mature markets, policy design risks and market design  regulatory risks are topranked. This may seem surprising, but it reflects what is occurring in many matured markets they are meeting the boundaries of the systems that have been designed to stimulate the rollout of wind energy. Now, a new phase begins, that might require different needs, and therefore different policy, market and regulatory designs e.g. to reduce incentives and to integrate wind energy to the market. As a consequence, policy design risks and market design  regulatory risks move into the focus.;Another way of comparing risks is to look at which stage they occur in the development process of a wind energy project. Figure 11 shows a simplified diagram of the development of a wind energy project defined in four phases inception phase (covering the first technical and formal preparation of the project development), the building phase (covering the construction of the wind energy plant), the operational phase (covering operation and maintenance, and depending on the support scheme selling of the generated power), and finally the postsupport phase (eligibility period of the support phase is over. All generated electricity must be sold on the market). The decommissioning phase is not shown here, since for onshore wind energy the risks of this phase are considered to be neglegible.
