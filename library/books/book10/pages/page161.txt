The cost of debt is regarded as more straightforward and simpler to estimate compared to the cost of equity. However, this is the case when the calculation is for a firm, especially when listed. The fair level of the cost of debt can be approximated by the credit rating of the company. Unfortunately this is not the case for this assessment. The main objective of these calculations is to determine the cost of debt for a renewable energy project. Projects do not have credit rating and if they do they are scarce. Therefore, an aggregate approach was implemented.;As input for the model, the results of both Bloomberg and Eurelectric approaches were discussed with financial experts. Based on this discussion the results of the Eurelectric approach was chosen as input for the WACC estimations, as this gave a more realistic result, especially for Greece and Cyrus.;Capital structure refers to the amount of equity and the amount of debt that a company or a project is using for its funding. The proportion of debt and equity may depend on the strategy that a company wants to follow but also on the industry sector that it operates. A large proportion of debt is considered as a more aggressive strategy as it could provide the potential to generate higher earnings but also increase the risk of bankruptcy. Industries that are capital intensive usually accumulate larger amounts of debt to fund their activities.;Debt is considered to be cheaper than equity as it takes lower risk position and thus project owners generally aim to increase the inclusion of higher debt into a RES project. The rest of this chapter examines the existing literature regarding the Debt to Equity ratio.
