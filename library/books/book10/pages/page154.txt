Beta is a measure of the comovement of share returns with the market portfolio returns. It expresses the sensitivity of the stock movement to the entire market.;Beta shows how much a stock amplifies the swings of the market portfolio. Beta values higher than 1 indicate that the stock is more volatile than the market while for Beta values less than 1 the opposite holds. Higher volatility and hence larger Beta result (theoretically at least) in higher compensation in the form of excess returns as it is risk that shareholders have to bear unable to eliminate it by diversification. Many utility companies have Beta lower than 1 whereas hightech technology companies have Beta larger than 1.;The most widely used way to estimate the CAPM Beta of a share is through statistical regression. The returns of a company are regressed on the returns of the market portfolio. It has to be noted that regression Betas are sensitive to estimation choices such as the frequency of data, the time period, and the assumption for the market portfolio. Nonetheless, there are no accepted standards dictating the use of specific inputs. As an example, large service providers use different sample periods and data frequency. Bloomberg uses twoyear weekly returns while Thomson Reuters, Standard  Poor and Morning star use fiveyear monthly returns.;Renewable energy projects do not have any stocks listed, therefore we cannot estimate the Beta directly through a regression. However, a representative Beta is derived by using the returns of comparable listed companies, a method called peer review analysis. First the Beta of every company is estimated, and afterwards the obtained values are averaged out. Lastly, the Beta factor is adjusted for the financial leverage of the project58.
