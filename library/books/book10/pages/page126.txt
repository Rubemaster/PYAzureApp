For the case of Luxembourg, no interview has been implemented. Below you may find the distribution of the nine risk categories and the related ranking of these, at a descending order, on the ground of risk premium estimation.;In the table next to the graph the model results are presented, showing the ranking order of the risk categories. Based on the model results, the most important risk source in Luxembourg is policy design followed by administrative risks. Unfortunately, no interview has been implemented to back test these results.;According to the 2014 EWEA annual report the total installed capacity of wind energy in Luxembourg was 58MW by the end of 2012. During 2013 no new installations took place, evidence of very few investments in the wind sector43..Per inhabitant, the installed wind capacity is 133W44, which is significantly lower than the EU average of 233Winhabitant. The picture is slightly different for the photovoltaic energy. As of 2013 the total cumulative PV capacity was 100MW, which is 186.2Winhabitant. This is slightly above the EU average of 155.8Winhabitant45. Together wind energy and photovoltaic energy account for almost 50 of Luxembourgs electricity production (23 and 20 respectively).;However, the presence of renewable energy in the total energy consumption of Luxembourg is only 3.1, which is significantly lower than the targeted 11 in 2020. Based on the National Renewable Energy Plan, established in June 2010, the national objectives for installed capacity are 113 MW of photovoltaic and 131MW of onshore wind46 by 2020. Based on this, it is expected that in the coming period, investments in renewable sources should increase.;43 Wind in power 2013 European Statistics, EWEA (2014). 44 Wind energy barometer Eurobserver (2014). 45 Photovoltaic barometer  Eurobserver (2014). 46 httpec.europa.euenergyentopicsrenewableenergynationalactionplans
