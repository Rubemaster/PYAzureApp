As the selected policy designs address different levels of uncertainties in revenues and expenditures, investors risks differ and, hence, the financing parameters do too. The survey results display different changes of interest rate, return on equity and equity shares by type of region and policy design. However, the presented results rely on a small number of cases (n  14) and are far from being representative for the whole EU. They should be considered as indicative results. The results for the EU will be shown as an average across all respondents, i.e. each respondent gets the same weight (lower bound) and as an average of countries, in which each country has the same weight (upper bound). The latter reduces the influence of the number of respondents per country while single answers per country receive a relatively high weight.;Figure 19 shows the lower and upper bounds of the EU average of interest rate (i), return on equity (ROE) and equity share (ES) under a sliding feedin premium policy (FIPs) design (see Box 1) for a period between June and September 2015. The lower bound takes the average of the respondents (equal weight for each respondent), the upper bound the average of the countries (equal weight for each country). The countries in the Southern part of the EU display about 1.16 times higher values for wind power projects than the Central EU Member States.
