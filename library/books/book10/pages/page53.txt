Given these financing parameters, the WACC is calculated based on the average financing parameters under a sliding FIP and a FIT. The first ranges roughly between 56 for the EU average, while the WACC under a FIT scheme is between 4.45 (Figure 20). The WACC level between central and Southern EU countries differs strongly under both policy schemes. For sliding FIP, the WACC is about 90 basis points (bp) (1  100bp) higher in South EU countries compared to Central EU countries, for FIT the difference is about 140 bp.;The changes in policy designs could lead to WACCs ranging between 4.55 p.a. for the low risk policy FIT (Figure 20) and between 67 p.a. for larger risk exposure in sliding FIP with tender or fixed FIP. While in Central EU countries the sliding FIP with tender is regarded as the policy with the highest risk  measured in terms of WACC , in Southern EU countries the fixed FIP policy is considered as more risky.;The switch from a sliding feedin premium to a sliding FIP with tender or fixed FIP, significantly increases the EU average of the WACC by about 100 bp (Figure 21). The results of a change to a sliding FIP without premium payments under negative market prices shows a relative large range. Differentiating between regions, the increase in cost of capital due to a shift from sliding to fixed FIP is perceived as much higher by central European countries (120160 bp) than by Southern European countries (90 bp). This might be explained by the difference in knowledge background and experiences with FIT, fixed and sliding FIP in these countries and highlight the relevance of perception.
