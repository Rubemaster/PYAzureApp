 Increased predictability of policy influences on market development Notably for CfD designs with a cap on the total support given per project (in terms of MWh), there is a risk that electricity market prices will fall to lower levels, with the level of support not being sufficient to bridge the finance gap. As these low prices would be a consequence of the deployment of more policy induced variable renewable energy (VRES) sources, governments may provide more clarity on the amount of (V)RES they intend to support for the coming 10 to 15 years (e.g. as part of tender schemes). This information (plus similar information from countries in the same electricity marketsystem) allows project developers and financiers to reduce the level of one risk component.;Description Market design  regulatory risks refer to the uncertainty regarding government energy strategy and powerenergy market liberalisation. Fair and independent regulation implies that electricity market regulation safeguards that RESproducers have nondiscriminatory access to the market.; Create a marketplace for all actors (i.e. free access of actors, no market entry and exit barriers, controlling body, private nonstate companies, etc.).; Reduce the revenue risk by continued RES support in times of moderately negative electricity prices The Energy and Environment State Aid Guidelines restrict the possibilities for governments to support renewable energies in times of negative prices. Due to the fact that RES investors only have limited means to mitigate the occurrence of negative prices at the electricity markets, the requirement to stop RES support payments during these times poses an unproductive risk.; Provide compensation for RES generators in case of gridrelated curtailment of RES generation The main mitigation measure for gridrelated curtailment is the investment in grid infrastructure. Since this mitigation measure is typically not the responsibility of RES generators, uncompensated gridrelated curtailment of RES generation poses an unproductive risk and should therefore be avoided.
