 Policy design and Financing risk have highest impact. Especially for wind, the gridaccess risk is also quite high.; Recent energy policy measures have increased the risk for investors. Until 2013 themarket was working well, now the interest of investors has massively decreased.;In general, renewable energy projects in Romania were rated as extremely risky. The two risks that were mentioned by all interviewees were the policy design risk and the financing risk.;With regard to the policy design risk, interviewees stated that the sudden policy design changes and the current RES policy in Romania have the highest impact on the costs of equity. According to stakeholders, these legal amendments made it almost impossible to sell renewable energy projects in Romania. For wind energy this risk is even higher, because the construction phase is longer. Therefore, the policy design and sudden policy change risk (possible legal changes during the construction) is significant.;The interviewed stakeholders agreed that the financing risk has also a great impact on RES investors. It was mentioned that in 2014 banks do not finance RES projects or require a very high equity share. Furthermore, the grid access risk is also quite high. In the past, grid access permits had been issued too quickly, leading to the situation that in several regions the grid capacity is now blocked. One interviewee also mentioned a market and regulatory risk, since in case of curtailment, there are no compensations for RES plant operators.; This risk was not mentioned during the interviews (n2) The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
