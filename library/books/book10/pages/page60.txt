Policies (other) Renewable energy projects are equally affected by corruption, political instability andor a dysfunctional legal system, as any other investment. However, RES policy instrument design should pay particular attention to misuse, gaming or fraud, which should be built in into the process and design of the support scheme.;Exchange rate fluctuations are of less importance to the countries in the Eurozone, but can be relevant for imported commodities that are being paid in other currencies (e.g. solar PV modules, biomass).;Description Lack of social acceptability of renewable energy investments can cause investment risks, e.g. through delays in or cancellation of projects, with associated cost for legal or regulatory processes. The NotInMyBackyard (NIMBY) mentality captures the phenomenon that citizens generally are in favour of renewable energies, yet oppose projects in their direct vicinity.;Project lifecycle impacts These risks predominantly occur during the planningproject development phase, where permits need to be acquired. In Europe, notably wind and bioenergy projects are confronted with opposition from directly involved stakeholders. But also a generic opposition against RES (e.g. through perceived high unjustified support costs, or through the higher burden on energy bills for specific groups) can delay or obstruct the realisation of RES projects. With increased deployment of RES, this opposition is likely to grow over time.;Risk strategy From a policy perspective a mitigation andor share strategy may be best followed. Mitigation strategies address the root causes of the opposition, for instance through communication programmes, stakeholder management and participation processes, smoothening of legal and regulatory processes, etc. In a sharing strategy the government takes over part of the project development activities, e.g. the acquisition of permits.
