The interviewee mentioned that the importance of these risk components is differentiated between the planning and operation phase of an onshore wind energy project. According to this distinction, the interview participant provided a general ranking of these categories for both these stages. For the case of projects under operation, the grid access, market design and regulatory and policy design risks are mentioned as the most important ones. In addition, the social acceptance impact is lower and the administrative risk is greater than the projects under the planning procedure (this specific ranking is provided above).;The market design  regulatory and the policy design risks are indicated to be the most influential risk parameters directly affecting the investment risk profile of a RES project under planning. In addition, the interviewee mentioned that sudden policy change risk is quite an important risk in France as the policy framework shows changes almost every two years. At last, technical  management and financing risks are stated as least important in both cases.;Regarding the riskiness of investments in the renewable energy sector, it was mentioned that if wind potential is well assessed, wind energy investments are pretty safe and less risky than other kind of investments. In this context, a new risk category, the wind potential risk, was recorded during this interview. In particular, as sites with great wind potential are already covered, the new power plants may not have the return that was initially expected.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
