Recent energy policy measures only increased these investmentrisks.;With regard to the policy design and sudden policy change risk, the stakeholders agreed that this issue has the highest impact on RES investors. After the Czech government started to introduce retroactive measures against renewable energy operators, many (especially foreign) investors were scared off and stopped investing in the Czech renewable sector. Moreover, the Czech Government even decided to abolish the entire feedin tariff system for all RES technologies. Without the support, it is unlikely that any new projects will be implemented in the future.;The grid access risk was also mentioned by both interview partners. Even if a project is actually being implemented, there is still the risk that the grid operator could refuse to connect it to his distribution or transmission system. However, since many projects do not even reach the phase of implementation, this issue is not as important as during the renewable energy boom until 2011, when the Czech RES sector was struggling with the virtual saturation of the grid.; This risk was not mentioned during the interviews (n2) The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results.
