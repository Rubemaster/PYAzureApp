Both models have some limitations the dividend growth model is not applicable for companies that do not pay dividends. Additionally, it assumes a constant growth rate for the future, and fails to deal with risk directly. Despite its broader applications, CAPM has also been criticised, mainly due to restrictive assumptions. CAPM has a static nature while the market is dynamic. Additionally, there is an empirical difficulty to assign values for some of the parameters used, such as the Beta coefficient and the return of a market portfolio.;Despite the critic received by many academics, the single factor CAPM is the most widely used method to obtain the cost of equity (Graham  Harvey, 2001 Bruner, et al., 1998). Specifically, according to Graham and Campbell, almost three out four practitioners use the single factor CAPM to estimate the expected return of equity.;The required return should be equal to the riskfree rate plus a market premium scaled by the Beta factor. This works as follows if a company or project is more risky than the market as a whole, the Beta will reflect that risk, increasing the cost of equity. Beta reflects the market or the undiversifiable risk of the company. The expected return does not incorporate compensation for diversifiable  unsystematic risk which is company specific and not due to the market as a whole.
