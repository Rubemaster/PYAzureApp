At the beginning of the project, certain risks are dominating, i.e. administrative risks as well as social acceptance risks and policy design risks. At this stage, the majority of projects fail (6080 according to project developers), thus the probability of a failure is relatively high. On the other hand, the invested capital at this stage is still relatively low (the value at risk), thus the financial impact of a failure is relatively low. However, these costs are usually fully borne by the project developers. This means that risks materialising at the very end of the inception phase might force project developers to terminate their project without being able to recover the incurred development costs. The later this happens, the higher the incurred costs.;In order to have a longterm sustainable business model, project developers have to recover costs in projects in order to make a financial close. If, for instance, the tendering takes place at a very late stage of the inception phase, it can lead to high incurred costs that have to be recovered in other projects. As a consequence, the overall prices of tendered projects can go up. More generally, processes during the inception phase (such as permitting or grid connection processes) can lead to increased costs if they
