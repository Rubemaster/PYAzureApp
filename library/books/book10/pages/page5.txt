After estimating the financing parameters, we gathered information on risks influencing the RES investments. These risks influence the cost of equity and cost of debt for RES and, thus, the WACC of RES investments. Based on reports, previous studies, and databases, an overview was created presenting the most important risks for each EU Member State.;The outcomes of the theoretical model were evaluated and tested during interviews with over 80 financial experts from 26 Member States3. Based on these interviews, both the financial parameters and the ranking of the risks were adapted and used to draft country risk profiles for each EU Member State.;In Part 2, the focus was to assess the impact of policy design changes on the cost of capital and to formulate policy measures to mitigate RES investments risks. First, a survey was conducted focusing specifically on the role of policy design. The respondents were asked to indicate how the interest rate, equity share, and the expected return to equity would change if policy design elements were changed. The results show how the WACC changes when switching from one policy design to another.;Finally, an assessment was made on how policy measures can influence the risks impacting onshore wind energy investments. In general, there are four risk control strategies avoid, mitigate, transfershare, and accept. For this study, mitigate and transfershare are most relevant. During the interviews with financial experts, information was gathered on how policies could mitigate investments risks. The results were used to prepare the policy toolbox.
