In order to fund investments, companies need to raise capital. This capital be their own capital or is attracted from external parties such as investors andor banks. These external parties will require then a fee for the money that they have made available for these projects. This is referred to as cost of capital and is basically the cost that a company has to bear in order to raise all needed funds. From an investors point of view, cost of capital is the required return that is demanded in order to invest. Hence, the cost of capital sets a threshold in the evaluation of a project for the minimum return required.;The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used to measure the cost of capital. The total capital of a company consists of debt and equity. The weighted cost of capital of a firm is the summation of the cost of every capital component multiplied by its proportional weight. The equation above illustrates that;The WACC represents the minimum rate that a company must bear given the existing assets in order to satisfy its creditors. Creditors will demand higher return to fund riskier activities. Hence, the WACC when calculated will produce a rate representative of the level of risk present in a companys activities.;When choosing the appropriate discount rate to evaluate a project, companies can either choose a corporate WACC or a WACC specific to a project. The cost of capital of the entire firm is not necessarily the same as the cost of capital of a project within the firm. This is because the risk of a project can be different from the risk of the overall company andor because it has different proportion of debt and equity (debtequity share). Therefore in order to estimate the WACC for a project we can view the project as undertaken by a company specifically set up for this project, having the same capital structure with it. Hence, the estimated WACC will reflect the risk of the project.
