According to the interviewees, the social acceptance risk is closely connected to the policy design and sudden policy change risks. Due to the fact that especially PV has a very negative image in the Czech Republic (the PV boom from 2009 to 2011 led to considerably higher electricity prices for consumers), the Government is blaming rising electricity prices on renewable energy operators and has therefore stopped all support for renewable electricity.;The interviewees agreed that the current policies are doing everything possible to raise the risk in order to prevent investors from implementing more RES projects. Since the Czech Government is currently not interested in supporting renewable energy, the aim is rather to stop the development of the sector completely.;The stakeholders mentioned several political measures first there was a connection moratorium which lasted for more than a year. Then, a retroactive fee was introduced for existing RES plants, which had a severe impact on the trust of foreign and Czech investors. And last but not least, the feedin tariff scheme was abolished completely. All these changes have made investments in RES in the Czech Republic almost impossible.
