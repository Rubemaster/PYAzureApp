Due to market failures (hidden subsidies, externalities), the market price of energy is not covering the full cost of renewable energy (RE) technologies. Therefore, policy support is required to make RES competitive with fossil alternatives. As a result of the financial crisis and changed political focus, renewable energy support has decreased in many of the Member States.;In several countries, the policy support has been decreased to a minimum or totally abolished, sometimes even retrospectively. As policy support is a very important condition for the business case of renewable energy, (sudden) policy changes impact the risk perception of investors. If investors see a high risk, they will ask a higher return for their investment, driving up the costs for renewable energy.;Policy support is not the only factor that has an impact on renewable energy investments. Permitting procedures, public perception, grid access etc. can influence investment decisions of financiers and be perceived as a risk. Understanding the risks and estimating their impact on renewable energy investments is therefore important to decrease the costs of renewable energy projects and enhance investments.;Investment risks vary between European Member States (e.g. as they are influenced by countryspecific conditions). Therefore, individual risks assessments can help identify the most important risks in renewable energy investments. Obtaining insights in these risks at Member State level helps to mitigate these risks, enhance investments in renewable energy and achieve the 2020 targets.;This report takes a closer look at the role of risk influencing RES investments. It focuses on identifying barriers and solutions to enhance investments in the RES sector.
