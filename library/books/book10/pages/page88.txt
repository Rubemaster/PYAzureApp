All three interviewees agreed that the recent energy policy measures in Bulgaria only increased the investment risks. Especially the retroactive changes (introduction of a grid access fee for existing RES plants) and the massive lowering of the feedin tariffs have deterred most foreign investors. Moreover, the state regulator has announced that there were no free grid capacities for PV and wind energy plants until 2016. This situation is further worsened by the fact that the Bulgarian Government announced it had achieved its renewable energy targets for 2020 and therefore decided to halt granting grid access permits even to already constructed projects. However, the alleged fulfilment of the RES target is strongly doubted by stakeholders from the Bulgarian renewable energy sector.;One interviewee mentioned that the most important political measure of the last five years was the decision of the Bulgarian Government to keep electricity prices for households artificially low. Currently, these prices are far below market prices. According to the interviewee, the entire energy market was therefore manipulated and different retroactive fees have been imposed on RES plant operators in order to save the stateowned TSO from bankruptcy.; Nowadays the ratio is more 5050. However, in the pastyears, there have hardly been any larger projects.;onshore and PV should be around 7.58 due to the highpolitical risk.
