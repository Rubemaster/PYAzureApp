We also aimed to look at the relation between the WACC and the policy design, represented by the choice for support scheme, as described in the RES LEGAL Europe website. This is presented in Figure 16 below.; The second factor is the country specific risk. Many markets still struggle with the aftermath of the financial crises. In such a situation, the country risks seem more decisive than the policy design risks and the national support scheme. As a consequence, comparisons between support schemes are only meaningful if the overall country risk is similar, too. In this regard the comparison between homogenous markets such as Denmark, Sweden and Finland is interesting. All three countries have a very low country risk, but the overall WACC in Sweden is significantly higher than in Denmark and Finland.
