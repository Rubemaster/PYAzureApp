Based on the results some conclusions can be drawn. First, all risks included into the model were mentioned as important risks by the interviewees. Second, technical  management risk was identified by interviewees to be the most important risk, whereas in the model technical  management risk was estimated to have no impact. Interviewees mentioned that financing, sudden policy change and policy design risks are very important and agreed that they should be treated equally important as technical  management risk.;Furthermore, some interviewees consider that in case of Latvia, baseline rate should have a higher impact on cost than it is modelled as macroeconomic risk is related to the political issues, which influence on countrys economic development and countrys relations with other countries. Since opinions on baseline rate diverged by reviewers, we assume that model results is in line with an aggregated opinion of the interviewees. Interviewees agree that market  regulatory, social acceptance, grid access and administrative risks have only a small influence on the cost of equity.;The colours indicate risk categories that have a different ranking in the model results and the interview results. Each risk has its own colour code.
