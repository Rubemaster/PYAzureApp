It is difficult to assess whether the increase of rates is due to specific renewable energy policies (e.g. the level of support per kWh), due to the general economic situation or due to a lack of competition between national banks. In any case, it sheds a light on a growing gap within Europe between Northern European countries that benefit from lower costs of debt and Southern European countries that do not.;The interview results for the cost of equity are presented in Figure 15. According to interviewees, the values of cost of equity has changed over the last years as a result of the collapsing renewable energy boom. During the boom, the cost of debt was much higher because the interest in business opportunities, as well as the interest in higher profit margins, had initiated speculations in grid capacities. This example illustrates that sustainable support scheme tariffs or quotas do not necessarily require high tariffs. Quite the contrary, in some cases, very attractive tariffs can cause instabilities for the overall policy design. The interplay between profitable and stable business conditions should be kept in mind when assessing or defining the policy design.
