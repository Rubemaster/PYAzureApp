Since 2007, renewable energy policy regime changed several times in Latvia with acceptance of new regulations regarding support to renewable energy. For example, changes were made to the methodology for calculation of feedin tariff resulting in lower support levels and also the share RESE in the total final electricity consumption was changed. This has increased uncertainty among investors and thus investment risks. Furthermore, there are differences between the support level of RESE technologies. Biomass and biogas electricity production receive more support and are therefore growing, while other technologies (including wind) receive less support and are therefore attracting less investments and remain smaller.;Interviewees did score the effectiveness40 of Latvia policies to decrease investment risks with a score of 2 (n2). Interviewees assume that existing policy regime does not greatly reduce investment risks. Although support to renewable energy is recognised as an important factor in reducing investment risk, other barriers remain and need to be solved. According to interviewees it is necessary to improve knowledge about the best available technologies in the country. Furthermore, the feedback between research institutions, the Government and business entities should be improved so as to inform more effectively businesses and households about the newest technologies and their benefits.
