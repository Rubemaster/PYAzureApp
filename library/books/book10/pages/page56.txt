As stated in section 3.1.1, the focus in this study was specifically on risks that are specifically related to RES investments. For this reason country risk was not included in the interviews with financial experts. However, since country risks are important, it is included in the policy toolbox to offer policy makers input for the formulation mitigating policy measures.;Each risk category has a different relevance andor weight in the various project lifecycle stages (in this report, we addressed planning, construction operations (anddecommissioning), see Figure 3 and Figure 22). Some risk categories indirectly affect the discount rate applied by investors  e.g. through inherent risks in the support scheme  , others directly affect the business case of a project  e.g. the annual variations in the energy yield. For each risk category, different strategies can be applied by the investor avoid (e.g. no investment, if the energy yield is not known), mitigate (e.g. arranging for highquality maintenance staff), transfershare (e.g. insurance, loan guarantees) or accept.;In the context of Triple A policy, the design of the instrument18 (notably mitigation and sharing) is important, as it reduces the risk to the investor andor financier. Avoidance of risk may often result in noninvestments in RES, whereas acceptance typically results in higher risk premiums and, hence, higher cost of capital. If government or policy design create inherent risks, risk mitigation through a different enabling environment, policy instrument design or risk sharing could reduce the cost of capital and accelerate the deployment of RES.
