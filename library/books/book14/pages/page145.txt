The magnitude of the effect depends on the search interval and how well the true persistence curve is estimated, particularly in the first few days. In a study conducted in 2013 in the northeastern USA, 29 carcasses were placed in the easy visibility class and foursurvival functions fitted to the data were ranked using the small sample sizecorrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) (Burnham  Anderson 1998). In rank order these were loglogistic, Weibull, lognormal and exponential (Figure 4.3). The twoparameter models differed by less than 0.5 AICc units from each other, indicating no clear advantage to any of the three, but all were at least 30 units from the exponential, indicating that all twoparameter models were clearly better approximating models than the exponential. Estimated proportions persisting through the daily search interval were, 0.60, 0.58, 0.66 and 0.83, respectively. In this case, assuming a constant removal rate with an exponential model would result in an overestimation of the proportion persisting and a consequent underestimation of fatality.;Figure 4.3 KaplanMeier curve (thin black step function with 95 confidence limits indicated by dashed lines) and fitted lines of four parametric survival functions loglogistic (solid black line) with lowest corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), Weibull (dashed line), log normal (dotted line) and Exponential (solid grey line). (Data provided courtesy of Iberdrola Renewables, LLC);The proportion of carcasses that an observer is expected to find in the searched area can be estimated from models of searcher efficiency using binomial models (Niermann et al. 2011). In a similar manner to persistence trials (see above), carcasses of a similar size and coloration to the species of interest are placed in the field some time before a scheduled search. Once the search has taken place, if the searcher did not find the trial carcass, an
