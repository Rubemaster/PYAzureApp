Although wind energy is generally recognised as a green renewable energy source with a relatively small footprint, several adverse effects of wind farms, especially on birds, cannot be neglected. Implementation of the mitigation hierarchy throughout the life cycle of a wind farm ensures that impacts can be mitigated at or below acceptable thresholds. This chapter provides a review of the available literature on specific options for mitigating bird impacts and the framework within which they are set for each step of the mitigation hierarchy. The prioritised steps of the mitigation hierarchy are tiered to the consecutive decision gates for wind farm development (1) avoid when planning, (2) minimise while designing, (3) reduce at construction, (4) compensate during operation, and (5) restore as part of decommissioning. The efficacy of mitigation measures depends on the sensory, behavioural and aerodynamic capabilities of the species at risk and is highly site specific. Appropriate siting of wind farms to avoid potential collisions, disturbance and barrier effects on birds is most effective. During the preconstruction design phase, birdfriendly micrositing can minimise placement of turbines at riskenhancing landscape features. Measures either adjusting turbine operation or warning or deterring birds approaching turbines are the most promising to reduce collisions during operation. To lessen displacement effects, on and offsite habitat alterations may be considered. Options for compensation and especially restoration are still in their infancy, and need to be further developed. Although the uptake of the entire mitigation hierarchy throughout the management cycle of a wind farm has been slow to date, its application can contribute towards the goal of lowest possible environmental costs per kilowatthour from wind energy.
