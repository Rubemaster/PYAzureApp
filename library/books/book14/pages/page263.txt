The effectiveness of ultrasonic deterrents in preventing bat fatalities at wind turbines is, however, limited by the distance and area across which ultrasound can be broadcast because ultrasound attenuates quickly and is heavily influenced by humidity. For example, 50 kHz emitted at 20C and 40 relative humidity would have a maximum effective distance range of 20 m (Arnett et al. 2013b) (Table 8.1). Arnett et al. (2013b) cautioned that ultrasonic deterrents are not yet ready for operational deployment at wind farms, but that further research, development and field studies are required. A key consideration is to attempt to optimise both placement and number of devices on each turbine to affect the greatest amount of airspace in the rotorswept area in order to estimate their potential maximum effectiveness in reducing bat fatalities. Future efforts must also evaluate the costeffectiveness of deterrents relative to raising cutin speed, for example, to allow acostbenefit analysis for mitigating bat fatalities. Once this work has been completed, acoustic deterrents may prove to be successful and broadly applicable for protecting bats from harmful encounters with wind turbines in the future.;Table 8.1 Calculated decibel level at different distances and frequencies at two different levels of relative humidity (10 and 40) for acoustic deterrent devices used by Arnett et al. (2013b).
