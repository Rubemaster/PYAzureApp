Estimates of cumulative bat fatalities at wind farms in North America suggest that nearly 840,500 to more than 1.69 million bats may have been killed from 2000 to 2011 (Arnett  Baerwald 2013). This estimate was projected to increase by 0.20.4 million bats in 2012 based on the same assumptions and installed wind power capacity (Arnett  Baerwald 2013). Since 2004, it is estimated that more than two million bats may have been killed by wind turbines in Germany, based on estimated fatality rates and reported development of wind turbines in that country (Voigt et al. 2015). Wind farm fatalities raise concern about cumulative impacts on bat populations, given the life history traits and reproductive capabilities of this taxonomic group (Barclay  Harder 2003 see Chapter 9 in this volume).;The context of wind turbine fatalities, however, remains poorly understood, in part because few population data exist for most bat species (OShea et al. 2003). This gap hinders knowledge of not only populationlevel impacts, but also effectiveness of mitigation measures. Estimates of populations for most species of bats around the world are lacking, although some species are known or suspected to be in decline (e.g. Frick et al. 2010 Hutson et al. 2001 Ingersoll et al. 2013). Others, such as hibernating species in Europe, appear to be increasing (e.g. Van der Meij et al. 2014), although most of these are mostly unaffected by wind turbines (Arnett et al. 2015). In addition to natural and other forms of anthropogenic induced mortality, wind turbine mortality further compounds population declines for many species of bats (Arnett et al. 2015). Given the magnitude and extent of windturbine related bat fatalities worldwide, the conservation implications are critically important and bat fatalities should be avoided, minimised or mitigated.;This chapter provides a review and synthesis of information regarding options for mitigating bat fatalities at wind farms by using all published articles and publicly available reports compiled by Arnett and Baerwald (2013) for their synthesis on wind energy impacts on bats. Mitigation options are discussed following steps outlined in the mitigation hierarchy following Kiesecker et al. (2010) and outlined in Chapter 16 in this volume. This begins with (1) avoidance of sites where the risk of collision is high or involves the potential fatality of vulnerable species, followed by (2) minimisation approaches, such as raising turbine cutin speed and
