The chapter is dedicated to Caoimhe Muldoon of BirdWatch Ireland, who passed away unexpectedly during the editing of this book. Caoimhe was a vibrant, loving person who made a lasting impression on all who met her. Her love of and interest in the natural world was profound. Her enthusiasm, outgoing and adventurous nature made her a natural communicator and an inspiration she will be keenly missed by all who knew her.;Careful site selection is key to minimising adverse effects of wind farms on wildlife, and this can be aided by planning tools such as sensitivity maps, which are especially advanced for birds. In countries belonging to the European Union (EU), spatial wind farm plans must be subject to Strategic Environmental Assessment. Lack of consideration of environmental concerns can slow the planning process, and examples of this can be found in Bulgaria, Spain and Slovenia. Sensitivity mapping and early stakeholder engagement can help to flag up possible environmental concerns at an early stage in the planning process and aid the location of wind farms. The production of sensitivity maps can be a useful tool to help identify more sensitive areas upfront at the early stages of the planning process. The first sensitivity map for onshore wind farms was produced for Scotland in 2006, based on the Special Protection Area network plus buffered locations of 16 EUprotected bird species, as listed in Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, considered sensitive to the effects of wind farm development. Since then, many international and regional maps have been created using a variety of approaches. Some have been incorporated into national guidance, overlaid with other natural heritage considerations, and some have included social or economic constraints, such as wind resource. Here, sensitivity mapping approaches and their uses and limitations are reviewed. Sensitivity maps are intended to be used by decision
