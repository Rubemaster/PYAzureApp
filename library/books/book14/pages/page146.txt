The proportion of carcasses that an observer is expected to find in the searched area can be estimated from models of searcher efficiency using binomial models (Niermann et al. 2011). In a similar manner to persistence trials (see above), carcasses of a similar size and coloration to the species of interest are placed in the field some time before a scheduled search. Once the search has taken place, if the searcher did not find the trial carcass, anindependent monitor will check to make sure it was actually still present before noting that this carcass was not found. If a carcass is not found, it can be left in the field to serve as a trial carcass for a second search, or more searches, as long as it persists. Alternatively, if a different searcher is due to search the same area on the next scheduled search, a found carcass can be left in place to serve as a trial for another first search or as a trial to determine the effect of carcass age on observability.;Searcher efficiency within a search plot can vary with vegetative cover, ground texture and colour, among other factors, so the searched area is commonly divided into separate visibility classes, each with its own estimated searcher efficiency. Examples are gravelled areas primarily comprising the roads leading to a turbine and the pad surrounding the turbine scattered brush in a desert landscape or cropland surrounding a turbine (Figure 4.4).;Figure 4.4 Differences in microenvironment heterogeneity and visibility class in three habitat types in which wind farms are commonly sited (A) road and pad beneath turbines with low microenvironment heterogeneity and easy visibility (Michael Schirmacher) (B) open scrub with moderate microenvironment and moderate visibility (C) crops below turbines with high microenvironment heterogeneity and difficult visibility. (Manuela Huso);Searcher efficiency also varies with the age of the carcass (WarrenHicks et al. 2013) as natural decay may lead to decreasing detectability of a carcass as it ages.
