Compensation may be divided into four broad categories (1) on site (in or adjacent to the wind farm), (2) offsite, (3) inkind (same or similar), and (4) outofkind. (Table 6.1). Compensation can thusbe achieved by offsetting the same biological parameters as the impacts from a wind farm (inkind) (Marques et al. 2014), including reducing mortality (Walker et al. 2005), enhancing breeding success (Golder Associates 2012) or improving (foraging) habitat (Walker et al. 2005 Martin et al. 2012 MartnezAbran et al. 2012). Other humaninduced impacts limiting bird populations, such as electrocution (Cole  Dahl 2013), may also be compensated (outof kind) (Marques et al. 2014) by marketbased schemes such as mitigationconservation banking and in lieu fees (McKenney  Kiesecker 2010). Compensation may be implemented by strengthening either the local population (onsite) or the wider geographic population (offsite). For instance, Cole and Dahl (2013) calculated that retrofitting 2540 of the most dangerous power line pylons on the island of Smla could offset Whitetailed Eagle fatalities at the Smla wind farm (Figure 6.5). Although onsite compensation alleviates impacts where they occur, it may simultaneously lead to piecemeal and fragmented conservation. In contrast, offsite banking initiatives and in lieu programmes may collectively fund the conservation of important habitat at the landscape scale, and allow the consideration of cumulative impacts (Kiesecker et al. 2011a). Restoration of degraded or lost habitat is often seen as an important compensatory measure for development (Aradottir  Hagen 2013), contributing either to bird conservation (inkind) or to climate mitigation through carbon accumulation in biomass and soil (outofkind) (see also Restore into the wild, below).;Table 6.1 Examples of compensatory measures for wind energy deployment.
