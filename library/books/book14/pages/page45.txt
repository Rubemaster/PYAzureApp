Figure 1.11 Preconstruction raptor use rates are typically used to predict raptor fatality rates from the use rates that had been estimated at the same wind farms where the fatality rates were estimated.;The problem with lumping or pooling species to generate a predictive model of raptor fatalities is exemplified by the general relationship used as an industry standard in Figure 1.11, which has two key problems. First, the species composition of the predictor variable differs from that of the dependent variable. Secondly, the regression slope would not have been positive or significant without the two data points at the upper right aspect of the scatterplot (Y  0.131  0.124X r2  0.086, P0.10). Those two points were wind farms in central California, namely High Winds of Solano County in 2004 and Diablo Winds in the APWRA in 2006, whereas the other data points were mostly from Washington and Oregon. Of the raptor fatalities composing the Diablo Winds datum, 69 were Burrowing Owls, which were not recorded as fatalities at the other wind farms compared, so the Burrowing Owls at Diablo Winds in 2006 served as an inappropriate predictor of raptor fatalities at most other wind farms. In 2008, owing to high interannual variability in fatalities, Burrowing Owls composed 42 of the fatalities at Diablo Winds. Furthermore, annual Burrowing Owl use rates, which ranged widely from 0.05 per hour to 0.8 per hour, did not correlate with fatality rates over the period sampled (20062010). For Golden Eagle, another pooled raptor, use rates varied from 0.45 per hour to 1.71 per hour from 2006 to 2010, averaging 2.5 times greater than Burrowing Owl, although fatalities only constituted 3 of that of Burrowing Owl and 2.6 and 0 of overall raptor fatalities in 2006 and 2008, respectively. Mean annual Golden Eagle use rates showed no correlation with fatality rates. Pooling species together clearly also hides a number of critical details.
