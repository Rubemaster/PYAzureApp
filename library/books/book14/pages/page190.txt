Environmental and social issues will affect wind energy deployment opportunities. The construction and operation of wind power plants impacts wildlife through bird and bat collisions and through habitat and ecosystem modifications, with the nature and magnitude of those impacts being site and speciesspecific. As wind energy deployment increases and larger wind power plants are considered, existing concerns become more acute and new concerns may arise. Appropriate planning and siting procedures can reduce the impact of wind energy development on ecosystems and local communities, and techniques for assessing, minimising and mitigating the remaining concerns could be further improved.;Achieving the lowest possible environmental and social costs per kilowatthour from wind energy therefore depends on technological advances in developing birdfriendly turbines and mitigation measures, and the ability to meet environmental and societal challenges. Because of the fast rate of wind energy development it will, however, become a challenge to verify impacts on bird life and construct ways of mitigating them (Langston  Pullan 2003). Although the negative impacts of wind energy production on bird life are said to be both site specific and species specific, they very often become one of the main issues concerning biodiversity when new wind farms are planned. In practice, the step from documenting the extent of the impact caused by the construction and operation of wind farms to successful mitigation is normally a very long one (Lehman et al. 2007). Mitigating windturbine induced mortality is particularly complicated because it may originate from collision, disturbance and barrier effects, with the nature and magnitude of those effects being site and species specific (Box 6.1). These concerns have stimulated research to quantify these effects postconstruction, and to predict the extent of effects preconstruction in connection with the planning of new wind farms.
