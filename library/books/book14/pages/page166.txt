BirdLife Internationals online mapping tool helps the wind industry, planning authorities and project funders to avoid siting wind farms in areas where conflict with soaring birds is likely. Owing to their morphology and behaviour, soaring birds, such as raptors, cranes and storks, are especially vulnerable to collisionswith turbines and overhead power lines. The tool maps spatial ornithological data, including satellitetracking records, for these species and generates a metric of site sensitivity for any user defined search area. The tool covers the Middle East and north east Africa, an area containing the Rift ValleyRed Sea flyway, which is the second largest flyway in the world for soaring birds (Figure 5.1). The flyway hosts the migration of over 2 million soaring birds migrating between their wintering grounds in Africa and breeding grounds in Europe and Central Asia. The area is subject to huge development pressures, caused by increased demands for energy, food supply and tourism. In future, the tool will be expanded to more regions, beginning with North Africa, Turkey and the Balkans. The tool has been developed as part of the Migratory Soaring Birds (MSB) Project, an initiative supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The project has also produced a range of guidance documents relating to the renewable energy sector in this region.
