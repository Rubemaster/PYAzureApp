For some species, a high proportion of their population will occur within designated sites. For example, in the UK, distributions of congregational species of wintering geese and other waterfowl, aswell as colonial nesting seabirds, are well represented within the SPA network, within both individual species criteria and assemblage criteria where populations exceed 20,000 individual birds (Stroud et al. 2001). However, other species are more widely dispersed, meaning that designated sites alone do not fully represent the distribution or contain a substantial part of the population of all species of conservation concern. For example, only 15 of the UK breeding population of Golden Eagle occurs within SPAs (Stroud et al. 2001).;In the EU, the Birds and Habitats Directives afford legal protection not just within designated areas, but also to priority species and habitats outside Natura 2000 sites for example, bird species listed on Annex I of the Birds Directive (EU 2009). These species of birds will vary in their susceptibility to adverse effects of wind farms, with raptors seemingly being more susceptible to the effects of collision (see Chapter 8 in this volume), and waders and other waterfowl to the effects of disturbance displacement (see Chapter 7 in this volume). For Europe, a list of sensitive bird species can be found in EC (2010), and of bat species in Rodrigues et al. (2008), although both may need to be updated as new studies come to light.
