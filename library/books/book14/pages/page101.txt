Figure 3.1 Flowchart illustrating the principal elements of all quantified collision risk models (adapted from Smales et al. 2013). The output metric of most models is the number of flights at risk. The Biosis model allows for the number of individuals at risk to be incorporated if appropriate census data are available.;To the extent that is feasible, these values are drawn from empirical information for the particular wind farm and its site. Empirical data for bird flights at the site are used to derive an annual number of flights at risk. All input values that are derived from such sample data have an inherent potential for error, and Douglas et al. (2012) have evaluated this for flight data used as an
