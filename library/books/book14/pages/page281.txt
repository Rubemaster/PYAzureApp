While knowledge and further understanding of wind energy wildlife interactions have become increasingly established, there is often a failure to consolidate this knowledge and include research findings into planning. While the oftstated sitespecies season specificity makes knowledge transfer difficult, unexploited synergies in what has been learnt to further wind energy projectsalso remain untapped.;First, providing international exchange platforms is an important component in order to boost international cooperation. The increasing number of established scientific conferences, such as the biennial National Wind Coordinating Collaborative Wildlife Group research meetings in the USA and the Conference on Wind energy and Wildlife impacts series in Europe, help to strengthen the international community by bringing together a wide spectrum of stakeholders (Figure 9.1). Webinars via virtual platforms are another instrument that makes it possible to assemble international stakeholders more frequently and with relatively low logistical and financial expenses. Furthermore, international collaboratives such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) Wind Task 34 working group (WREN) are additional pooling opportunities that can support the deployment of wind energy technology at a global level by enhancing the understanding of environmental issues, efficient monitoring programmes and effective mitigation strategies (IEA Wind 2014).;Figure 9.1 Conference on Wind energy and Wildlife impacts (CWW15), 1012 March 2015 IEA Wind Task 34 and conference participants broke up into groups to discuss implementations of adaptive management (AM), bringing together different opinions, thoughts and perspectives on AM for the future.;Secondly, in addition to the described facetoface exchange, it is crucial to publish and distribute international findings. By gathering international research results, conformities and contradictions can be identified, allowing for further consolidation in understanding potential impacts and the efficiency of mitigation measures, and formulating future research needs.
