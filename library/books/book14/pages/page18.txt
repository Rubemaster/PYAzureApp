The same survey methods can also be used during postconstruction monitoring to estimate barrier effects and displacement (Garvin et al. 2011 Loesch et al. 2012), to test mitigation measures or to compare use rates and fatality rates directly for sensitive species. In at least one case, postconstruction monitoring also included nocturnal surveys to quantify behaviour rates, passage rates and avoidance rates of owls and nocturnal migrants (Smallwood, unpublished data 2015). Postconstruction monitoring was used by de Lucas et al. (2012a) to shut down select turbines as soaring Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus approached during the migratory months of October and November, hence reducing Griffon Vulture fatalities by 50 with negligible impacts on wind farm energy generation.;Table 1.1 Recommendations (X) and implied recommendations (I) in guidance documents.
