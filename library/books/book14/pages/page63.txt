The review of monitoring methods is undertaken in the context of the doctrine that selecting the location of a project is generally the most important consideration to minimise potential negative impacts to bats and their habitats (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2011). Site selection can be informed by conducting pre construction studies and assessing the activity patterns and presence of species of interest, or by reviewing pre or postconstruction data from sites in close proximity or in similar habitat types. Because it is not fully understood why bats are interacting with wind turbines, continued monitoring is needed at every site. In addition, research,
