Interactions between bats and wind turbines are poorly understood. The combination of small body size, nocturnal activity, volancy (ability to fly) and variation in dependency upon resources, such as food, water and roosts, of bats makes it difficult to ascertain their behaviour and how they react to and interface with wind turbines (Gannon et al. 2003 Kunz et al. 2007a). The dearth of information upon which to base decisions hinders siting wind turbines in suitable locations, and developing ecologically sound and economically feasible solutions to reduce what appears to be a growing impact of wind farms on bats (Arnett et al. 2007 2013).;Bat fatalities in Europe were first discussed in regard to wind farms near coastal areas during the mid1990s (Bach et al. 1999 Rahmel et al. 1999). At the time, few countries had monitoring guidelines and fewer considered bats. In 2008, EUROBATS first published guidelines for bats and wind farm projects to raise awareness among planners and operators of the need to consider bats and their roosts, migration routes and feeding areas when developing wind farms (Rodrigues et al. 2008). The EUROBATS guidelines were revised in 2014 (Rodrigues et al. 2015) and continue to offer both specific and general recommendations that serve as a minimum requirement for national guidelines. If EUROBATS guidelines are too general, national guidelines may make them more specific or regulate issues that are not mentioned (Rodrigues et al. 2015).;In the USA and Canada, relatively few bat fatalities were reported at wind farms before 2001 (Johnson 2005) however, this may have been an artefact of study designs focused on finding carcasses of large birds, such as raptors (Anderson et al. 1999 Kunz et al. 2007b). Bat fatalities received little attention until 2003 when unprecedented high fatality rates were reported at wind farms along forested ridgelines in the Appalachian mountains of Pennsylvania and West Virginia (Arnett et al. 2008). Since this discovery, studies specifically designed for bats have become more prevalent across the USA and Canada. However, the methodology required varies across states and provinces from those with no guidance to those with wellarticulated protocols such as Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) 2013 and Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2011). In 2012, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) finalised a set of voluntary wind energy
