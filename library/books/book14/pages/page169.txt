Figure 5.2 Composite sensitivity map of Scotland for the location of onshore wind farms with respect to a suite of sensitive bird species Bright et al. 2006 presented here at tetrad (2  2 km) level of resolution to protect the locations of sensitive species.;This map was followed by mapped and written guidance for birds and onshore wind farms in England (Bright et al. 2009). This was based on the SPA network plus locations of 12 species, and relied more on written, rather than mapped, guidance for more widespread species of conservation priority, such as Merlin Falco columbarius, Red Kite Milvus milvus and Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus. For both the Scottish and English sensitivity maps, the SPA network was used as a surrogate for the distributions of congregational species of wintering geese and other waterfowl, and colonial nesting seabirds (Stroud et al. 2001). In addition, for the English sensitivity map, IBAs (Heath  Evans 2000), SSSIs and Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) sites that held nationally or internationally important concentrations of breeding waders or wintering waterfowl were included, along with IBAs for breeding seabirds. One notable omission from the English sensitivity map was cropped feeding areas for geese and swans. This was because such feeding areas generally fall outside SPA boundaries, which are largely based on goose and swan roost locations, and may be a considerable distance from roost sites and tend to change in response to cropping patterns, making them difficult to map.
