The two Golden Eagle models were subsequently normalised and combined with an equally weighted contribution from the variable Hazard site (Table 7.4). The same was done for Redtailed Hawk (Table 7.4). The collision hazard models were projected over the Contra Costa County portion of the APWRA to show what they looked like spatially, and to test their performance against the Buena Vista wind turbines, which had been sited naively to the models because the models had not yet been prepared (Figure 7.8). All of the Golden Eagle fatalities occurred at wind turbines incollision hazard class 4. Redtailed Hawk fatalities were highest among turbines occurring in hazard classes 3 and 4.;Figure 7.7 Examples of how dependent (event) variables related to predicted hazard classes that had been developed to predict the events for Golden Eagles, including ridge crossings (left) and fatalities among monitored wind turbines (right).;Table 7.3 Redtailed Hawk fuzzy logic membership functions of DEM grid cells.
