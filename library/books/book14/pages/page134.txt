One important objective of postconstruction monitoring is to estimate the local andor cumulative impact of wind development on a group of species or a single species of concern. This can be very difficult to ascertain when information regarding the primary forces influencing population growth or decline is lacking. Nonetheless, the first, necessary step in understanding the impact on a population or species is accurate estimation of turbinecaused fatality. Unfortunately, this is not as simple as counting carcasses beneath turbines because detection of carcasses is highly variable. If the probability of detecting a carcass were less than one but nevertheless constant among carcasses, then a simple count could serve as an index and comparisons of this index across regions, sites or turbines would be meaningful. But differential detection probability among carcasses prevents meaningful comparison of simple counts and also meaningful interpretation of proportional species representation in the carcass population. Understanding the impacts of turbinecaused fatality on populations begins with unbiased estimates of fatality that combine data from detection probability models and observed counts to estimate the total number of fatalities at a site. How best to combine these data depends on the number of carcasses observed. When the number is very small or even zero, application of Bayes formula results in a posterior probability distribution of total fatality. When the number is not small, both semiparametric and parametric approaches have been proposed, and a thorough comparison between these two would be of great value. In any case, estimates derived from observed carcass counts must account for differential probability of detection. Otherwise, meaningful comparisons of fatality rates are
