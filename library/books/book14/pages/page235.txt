0.5  (1  cos(  (Y  Vc) (Vf  Vc))) above the meanwhere Vc represents the variance term (SD or SE) closer to the mean and Vf represents the variance term farther from the mean (Figure 7.6).;Figure 7.6 Example fuzzy logic membership functions of interacting Golden Eagles and hill size (top left) and Golden Eagle nearmisses with wind turbine with percent up slope (top right), and kitinghovering Redtailed Hawks with percent up slope (bottom left), and Redtailed Hawk fatalities with elevation of the nearest ridge crest (bottom right). Membership values of 1 expressed the highest likelihood of the event happening in the particular grid cell, 0 the least likelihood, with the fuzzy boundaries in between.;For nominal and ordinal predictor variables, ratios of observed to expected events were used to weight each class or category of the variable. For example, if Golden Eagle events were observed five times other than expected on ridges oriented eastwest, then the grid cell membership function would be 5. Membership functions were rounded to 0.5 to minimise false precision.
