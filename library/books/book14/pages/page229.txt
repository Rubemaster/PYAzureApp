Each bird was recorded as point features connected by vector lines depicting the birds flight path. Height above ground, behaviour and time into the session were recorded into Tascam digital voice recorders fitted with windjammers designed to reduce noise buffeting by high winds. Point features were recorded as often as the observer could record attribute data, usually every 310 seconds. Special attention was given to the birds flight whenever it flew within 50 m of a wind turbine and, in the opinion of the observer, faced the possibility of colliding with the wind turbine. During this time, the birds approach angle to the turbine was recorded, as well as any changes in flight direction, flight height, behaviour, interactions with other birds and the wind turbines operating status. Whenever special attention was directed to such flights, the flight observation was termed a wind turbine interaction event.;At the start of each behaviour session, the observer identified which wind turbines in the survey area were operating, as well as temperature, wind direction, average and maximum wind speed, and percentage cloud cover. Behaviour data were transcribed to electronic spreadsheets within 24 hours of collection. Mapped bird location points and line features representing the birds flight path were then digitised for use in a geographic information system (GIS).
