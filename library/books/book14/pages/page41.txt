Figure 1.7 Decline in average percentage of the airspace that is visible from the observation stations in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) with increasing distance from the observer.;Related to the potential bias in variation in visible airspace under observation, variation in maximum survey radius can add bias to comparisons of use rates because detection probabilities are partly functions of distance. Examined among radial bands generated in GIS and extending from the observer, the rates of increase in use rates slowed with increasing distance from the observer (Figure 1.8), strongly implying that speciesspecific correction using a distance sampling approach (Buckland et al. 2001 2004) is required, perhaps through the use of appropriate software (Thomas et al. 2010). The relationships between use rates and distance from the observer increased in complexity when the use rates were adjusted for the volume of visible airspace within each radial band and when the rates were restricted to specific behaviours (Figure 1.9). When examined in this way, detection rates typically peaked at a certain intermediate distance from the observers, perhaps as a result of (1) a peak in the proportion of sky background corresponding with those distances, (2) birds avoiding observers within 100 m of the observers, and (3) a lesser likelihood of seeing birds at far distances owing to the rapidly increasing volume of airspace that is being scanned at greater distances. Variation in the maximum survey radius is probably one of the largest sources of bias in comparisons of use rates (see also Madders  Whitfield 2006), and it interacts with the variation in visible volume of airspace among stations and wind farms.
