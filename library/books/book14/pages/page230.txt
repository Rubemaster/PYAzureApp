To understand how wind turbine collision fatalities relate to terrain features, annual fatality rates at the APWRAs wind turbines that were monitored for at least one year from 1998 through 2011 were estimated. All fatality rates were adjusted for search detection and carcass persistence rates, which were averaged among wind projects where trials were performed in similar grasslandenvironments to the APWRA (Smallwood 2013). Fatality rates were also adjusted for variation in the maximum search radius and wind turbine tower height, based on the method used by Smallwood (2013). Finally, fatality rates were adjusted for monitoring duration to account for bias warned about by Smallwood and Thelander (2004, Appendix A) As the number of fatalities is averaged into more years of survey effort, the resulting fatality rates will decrease inversely with increasing number of years because the numerator of the rate (fatalities) will vary less than the denominator (years) among wind turbines where fatalities were found. An example of this relationship for Golden Eagle and Redtailed Hawk is shown in Figure 7.3. Bias was corrected by fitting an inverse function to the data, and then multiplying the ratio of observed to predicted values by the predicted value at 10 years of monitoring (Figure 7.3). In other words, all fatality rates at individual wind turbines were adjusted to a common 10year period of monitoring, even if they had been monitored for only 1 year, 4 years, 10 years, and so on. It should be noted that the fatality rate metric in this case excluded the turbines rated capacity (MW).;Figure 7.3 Mean annual fatalities per year declined inversely with the number of years used in the denominator for Golden Eagle and Redtailed Hawk (left graphs). Fitting inverse functions to the data removed the effect of number of years on the metric (right graphs).
