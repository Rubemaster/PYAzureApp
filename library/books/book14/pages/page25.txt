Surveys directed towards understanding how birds behave in windresource areas and how these behaviours connote collision risk began during the 1990s with Lawrence et al. (2007), de Lucas et al. (2007), Barrios and Rodrguez (2007), Rugge (2001) and Lekuona and Ursa (2007). Behaviour surveys have evolved methodologically ever since (Smallwood  Thelander 2004 2005 Hoover  Morrison 2005 Smallwood et al. 2009a 2009c Smallwood, unpublished data 2015). In these surveys, individual birds are detected and followed visually until either the bird disappears from the plot or a higher priority species appears. Results of behaviour surveys showed promise for understanding how birds react to wind turbines (de Lucas et al. 2007 Smallwood et al. 2009b Johnston et al. 2014) and for predicting wind turbine impacts (Barrios  Rodrguez 2007 Smallwood et al. 2009a), and have since been used to develop mapbased predictive models for collision hazard (Smallwood et al. 2009b see Chapter 17 in this volume). De Lucas et al. (2012b) related Griffon Vulture flight trajectories to wind flows to conclude that these vultures follow wind patterns to minimise travel effort, and proposed using this strategy to guide micrositing.;Radar has been used to detect and count flying targets consisting of bats, local nocturnal birds, nocturnal migrants and even diurnal birds. It may thus be used in Scenario D of Figure 1.1. One of the strengths of radar is its ability to measure nocturnal flight activity, and another is to detect many more targets simultaneously than can be detected by visual scans. For example, Harmata et al. (1998) reported detection rates of flying birds using radar that were 717 times greater than those using visual scans. With the higher detection rates it is also possible to detect patterns of avoidance around wind farms and turbine rows (Dirksen et al. 2000 Villegas Patraca et al. 2014), to quantify timing and flight heights associated with passage rates, and to estimate collision risk and barrier effects of wind turbines (Dirksen et al. 2007 Plonczkier  Simms 2012).;Weaknesses of radar include the inability in many cases to identify targets to species level, and bias in estimating distributions of flight heights due to ground clutter and other sources of low altitude interference. Radar requires clear weather (Hanowski  Hawrot 2000), so can bias observations towards conditions that pose less collision risk to birds. It also suffers a similar decline in detection rates with increasing distance from the radar as experienced with visual scans. The most important weakness is
