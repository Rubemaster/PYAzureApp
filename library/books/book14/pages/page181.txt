Figure 5.4 Transmission line segments from the RETI conceptual plan (Olsen et al. 2012).;RETI provides a good model of how planning processes can be facilitated with early public consultation and consideration of environmental impacts. It also built stakeholder and agency support for renewable energy development and provides a good model for planning locations of renewable projects and associated infrastructure.;Following completion of the Scottish birds and wind farms sensitivity map, RSPB Scotland wrote to local planning authorities in Scotland inviting them to request more detailed maps for their specific areas. It also provided the map to developers, consultants and other stakeholders to help inform the early stages of the planning process, such as initial site selection and scoping, and to assist with determining more and less sensitive areas and so the extent to which additional data collection was needed in the EIA process. The Highland Council used the sensitivity ratings, alongside other constraint layers such as cost, visibility and designated sites, when identifying preferred areas for wind farm development in the Highland Renewable Energy Strategy (Aquatera 2006). SNH adopted a different approach and produced its own location guidance for wind farms in Scotland by incorporating a number of different natural heritage sensitivities including the Scottish sensitivity map (SNH 2009).
