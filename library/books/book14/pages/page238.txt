The Redtailed Hawk model was composed of seven membership functions, four of which included fuzzy boundaries (Table 7.3). Red tailed Hawks hovered and kited disproportionately over ridges oriented west to east and northnorthwest to southsoutheast. They hovered and kited disproportionately over slopes oriented south west, westsouthwest and west. Redtailed Hawks hovered and kited disproportionately over ground that was between 87 and 95 to the top of the slope. Redtailed Hawk kiting and hovering was broader across major terrain features, with peak activity ranging between 78 and 93 to the top of the feature.;The two Golden Eagle models were subsequently normalised and combined with an equally weighted contribution from the variable Hazard site (Table 7.4). The same was done for Redtailed Hawk (Table 7.4). The collision hazard models were projected over the Contra Costa County portion of the APWRA to show what they looked like spatially, and to test their performance against the Buena Vista wind turbines, which had been sited naively to the models because the models had not yet been prepared (Figure 7.8). All of the Golden Eagle fatalities occurred at wind turbines in
