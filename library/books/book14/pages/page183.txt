Sensitivity mapping can be a useful tool for spatial planners, statutory and nonstatutory conservation bodies, as well as wind farm developers and their consultants, to identify likely sensitive areas at the early stage of the planning process. Such strategic planning to balance wind farms and biodiversity can speed up the planning process and increase certainty for developers by reducing the potential for conflict, such as objections to proposed developments further along the consenting process. Sensitivity maps have their limitations, being only as good as the available data and requiring regular update, and are only intended to provide guidance, rather than to represent areas excluded from development or replace the need for sitespecific EIA. The extent to which sensitivity maps have been incorporated into the planning process varies greatly, from a high level of incorporation, such as in France where they affect subsidy levels, to no incorporation at all. Both maps and spatial planning require a high degree of stakeholder engagement so that all different stakeholders and interest groups can mould the planning policy framework at an early stage, thereby expediting the planning process for individual projects. Their adoption should go some way to avoid green versus green arguments (e.g. Warren et al. 2005) and ultimately ensure a win win situation for renewable wind energy and wildlife (Kiesecker et al. 2011).;We would like to thank Benedict Gove, Rowena Langston, Daniel Pullan and Ivan Scrase, all of the RSPB, for advice and their previous work, which was an invaluable source of material for the production of this chapter. We would also like to thank Joris Everaert, Thanos Kastritis, Tomaz Jancar, Andrea Kuiper and Samantha Ralston for completing surveys or providing other information on their sensitivity mapping exercises.
