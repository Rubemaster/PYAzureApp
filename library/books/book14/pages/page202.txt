Another option for mitigation of impacts is to alert birds to turbines or deter birds away from turbines through visual or audible sensory cues. The frontal vision in birds is tuned for the detection of movement (Martin 2011). Improved visibility of the rotor blades may therefore alert diurnal birds to the turbine structure, either by painting one rotor blade black to reduce motion smear (Hodos 2003) or by using ultravioletreflective paint on rotor blades for ultravioletsensitive species (Young et al. 2003). Gulls and passerines are sensitive within the ultraviolet spectrum (355380 nm) (deen et al. 2010 Lind et al. 2014). Raptors and owls, including Burrowing Owl and Golden Eagle, seabirds and waders, and gallinaceous birds are sensitive within the violet spectrum (402426 nm) (Hstad et al. 2005 deen  Hstad 2013 Doyle et al. 2014 Lind et al. 2014). At the Smla wind farm, an average of 7.8 Whitetailed Eagles and 14.8 Willow Ptarmigans Lagopus lagopus collide with wind turbines annually (Bevanger et al. 2010). These high collision rates triggered research testing the efficacy of various mitigation measures, including painting one of three rotor blades black at four turbines to alert Whitetailed Eagles and reduce collision risk (Figure 6.4). Similarly, up to ten tower bases (010 m) were painted black, with the aim of raising the horizon to reduce collision risk in Willow Ptarmigans, which collide with the actual tower. As this is ongoing research, it remains to be seen whether these measures prove to be effective. Although decoys in the form of models of conspecifics deployed on the ground (Martin 2011) have been proposed, their efficacy is still debated (Marques et al. 2014). For nocturnal migrating birds, adjustment of the turbine lighting regimen has been proposed. Although lighted structures may attract or disorient nocturnal birds, at the Buffalo Ridge, Minnesota Wind Resource Area, USA, unlit turbines did not lead to fewer fatalities (Johnson et al. 2000). Using pulsating lights or other wavelengths (blue or green lights) (Poot et al. 2008) may, however, reduce fatalities (Johnson et al. 2007). An ex situ test on Smlausing (ultra)violet lights with irradiance levels within human safety criteria had only limited effect in deterring birds from the lit vertical airspace of less than 30 m (May et al. unpublished data). Auditory deterrence, including bioacoustics (alarm or distress calls) and lowfrequency infrasound (Bishop et al. 2003 Cook et al. 2011), is likely to be most effective when triggered using an automated realtime detection and trigger system to minimise habituation (Smith et al. 2011 May et al. 2012). Dooling (2002) suggested that an acoustic whistling cue (24 kHz) may help birds to hear the blades while adding almost nothing to the overall noise level.;Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus is the species most frequently killed by collision with wind turbines in Spain, and especially Tarifa in Cadiz Province, which contains the second highest number of breeding pairs of the species in the country (de Lucas et al. 2012a). The collision rate of this species is one of the highest in the world published in the scientific literature (0.228 vulture deaths per turbine per year). Collision mortality was spatially skewed, with the ten most dangerous turbines located within six different wind farms showing the highest mortality rates. Factors affecting the risk of collision include local topographical features and wind patterns at individual wind turbines (Barrios  Rodriguez 2004 de Lucas et al. 2008). To reduce collision rates, surveillance programmes have included procedures for selective stopping of turbines by trained observers when dangerous situations are detected. In such cases, turbines were stopped within a maximum of 3 minutes (Figure 6.3). This mitigation measure reduced mortality by 50 and the total energy production by only 0.07 (de Lucas et al. 2012a).
