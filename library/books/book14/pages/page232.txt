One of the more predictive terrain measures was the grid cells position on the slope, measured as the average of percentage distance and percentage elevation to the ridge top, which was named percent up slope (Figure 7.5). The same measurements were made to major valleys and major ridges, leading to the variable named percent up major terrain slope. Thus, on a small hill adjacent to a major hill in the area, a grid cell could be 90 under percent up slope and only 30 under percent up major terrain slope.;Figure 7.4 Lateral and vertical distances were measures from each grid cell centroid to the nearest valley bottom (gold lines) and ridgelines (green lines) and ridge crests (blue lines) forming subwatershed boundaries (top image) or major valley bottoms and major ridge crests (bottom image).;Further terrain measurements have been added since Smallwood et al. (2009a). Because percent up slope did not distinguish a grid cells position between slopes on large versus small hills, the variable hill size was derived to express the local topographic influence of the feature, where each cell was located by taking the elevation difference between the nearest valley bottom polygon and nearest ridge top polygon. Major hill size was the elevation
