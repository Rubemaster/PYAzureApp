K. SHAWN SMALLWOOD, LEE NEHER and DOUGLAS A. BELL;Collision hazard models were developed and implemented to guide the siting of new wind turbines as part of repowering the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area in California, one of the first of many repowering efforts likely to soon take place worldwide. The aim was to minimise collision risk by first understanding avian flight patterns and related behaviours, and how these patterns are influenced by terrain, wind and wind turbines. Utilisation and behaviour data were used to develop collision hazard models, which were then used for hypothesis testing against measured wind conditions and over a measured landscape. Models were validated using fatality data collected from a repowered wind project where wind turbines were not sited according to a collision hazard model. The models performed well for Golden Eagle and moderately well for Redtailed Hawk. However, the process of developing the models contributed more to careful siting than did the models themselves. What matters most is understanding how birds respond to winds, terrain and wind turbines, and using that understanding to carefully site the wind turbines to the maximum degree possible, given the landscape and political constraints on wind turbine siting and the tradeoffs of collision risk between species. It also became clear that direct visual observations are needed to observe flight behaviours and to record a birds positions frequently enough to characterise flight responses that are sufficiently finegrained to matter to wind turbine siting.
