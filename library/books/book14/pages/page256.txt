Few studies have disclosed the actual power loss and economiccosts of operational mitigation, but those that have suggest that less than 1 of total annual output would be lost if operational mitigation were employed during highrisk periods for bat fatalities. However, this percentage undoubtedly will vary in areas with different wind regimens and among different types of turbines. Lost power can be estimated from preconstruction wind data gathered from meteorological towers. In addition to the revenue from lost power, wind energy companies incur costs for staff time to set up processes and controls and to implement treatments from offsite 24hour operation centres.;In the European Union, all bat species are strictly protected (European Commission 2011). Thus, in many European countries the analysis of possible impacts on the bat fauna is part of the planning process for wind farms (e.g. Amorim et al. 2012). In Germany, bats have been a major concern in the planning process of new turbines for several years (Brinkmann et al. 2011), and the regulations of most federal states include bat surveys and operational curtailment for turbines with significant collision risks. Brinkmann et al. (2011) developed an operational mitigation method based on acoustic survey data that allows the average number of fatalities per turbine and year to be kept below a specific number while minimising the loss of energy production.
