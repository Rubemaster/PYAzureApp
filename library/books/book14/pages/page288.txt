Table 9.1 Overview of mitigation measures applicable at different development stages (i.e. siting, construction, operation, decommissioning) and species groups.aaCategorisation follows the mitigation hierarchy (i.e. avoidance, reduction, compensation, restoration). References listed come from peerreviewed literature, reports, books, conference material and grey literature.;aCategorisation follows the mitigation hierarchy (i.e. avoidance, reduction, compensation, restoration). References listed come from peerreviewed literature, reports, books, conference material and grey literature.bReferences have either observed a particular species when the mitigation measure was implemented or investigated the mitigation measure (realised or potential) for a particular species.;There is clear understanding and bipartisan policy on no net loss for biological diversity. By initially aiming to avoid a loss of biodiversity and, further, to focus on the replacement of unavoidable losses, the established mitigation hierarchy has been essential in wind development planning. Through avoidance of impacts on wildlife (e.g. siting), reduction (e.g. temporary curtailment), compensation (e.g. in lieu fees for offsite habitat enhancement) and restoration (e.g. of habitats and species), wind developers are able to conduct wind energy projects in an environmentally sound manner.
