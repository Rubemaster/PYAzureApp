For logistical support, we thank Renee Culver, Joanie Stewart and Loan Tran of NextEra. Directed behaviour surveys have been performed since 2012 by K.S. Smallwood, H. Wilson, E. Walther, B. Karas, J. Mount, S. Standish and E. Leyvas. We thank Daniel Funderburg, Sara Michehl, Leah Neher and Sherrity Neher for digitising bird locations from hard copy maps.
