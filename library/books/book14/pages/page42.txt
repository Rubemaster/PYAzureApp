Although the probability of detection of birds during use surveys should vary by species, sex when sexual dimorphism affects visibility, behaviour, ground speed, terrain and vegetation cover,little or nothing has been done to quantify detection rates as functions of any of these factors. Birds that more often call or fly in flocks or are larger should be more visible, and calling and flocking should vary seasonally and among places within the same species. A soaring bird should be more visible than a contouring bird, so long as the soaring bird is not too far away and contrast is not too low, and a kiting or perched bird will offer more opportunity for detection than a bird gliding with the wind across a narrow portion of the visible airspace. Surveys in an area of more frequent fog or low clouds will generate lower detection rates for the same species, as will surveys in more forested environments compared to grasslands. Despite these obvious factors, detectability is assumed to be equal when investigators compare fatality rates to pre construction use rates among wind farms.;Figure 1.8 The rate of increase of the cumulative number of first detections per hour slowed among 30.5 m (100 foot) radial bands extending away from the observer in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA). The rate of slowing was much faster for a small raptor such as American Kestrel (left) than for a large one such as Golden Eagle (right).
