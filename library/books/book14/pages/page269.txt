This manuscript was greatly improved by the review of Martin Perrow. I wish to thank WEST Inc. for sharing reports. I also wish to thank Oliver Behr, Robert Brinkmann and their colleagues for sharing their information on a case study on algorithms theydeveloped for mitigating bat fatalities in Germany.;Amorim, F., Rebelo, H.
