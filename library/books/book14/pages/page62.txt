This chapter provides a summary of the methods commonly used tostudy bat activity, behaviour and fatality at proposed and operational wind farms in the USA, Canada and Europe. These include ultrasonic acoustic detectors, infrared videography, radar, direct capture, roost surveys and radiotracking, which can be used in both pre and postconstruction studies, and fatality monitoring, which is only possible during the operational phase of a wind farm. The intent of this chapter is not to suggest that every proposed and operational site must employ each method, but rather to present the benefits and limitations of each method so that they can be used effectively when appropriate (Table 2.1). The subject matter is synthesised from a selection of publicly available reports, methods and metrics documents, government agency guidelines and peer reviewed studies.;Table 2.1 Benefits, limitations and when best to employ each method for studying the impact of wind turbines on bats.
