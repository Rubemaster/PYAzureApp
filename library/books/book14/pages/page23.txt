Circular (360degree) visual scans, also known as variable distance circular point observations (Reynolds et al. 1980), are usually performed by observers stationed at designated locations in a proposed or existing wind farm, consistent with scenario A in Figure 1.1 (Osborn et al. 1998 Rugge 2001 Lekuona  Ursa 2007 Smallwood et al. 2009b). Each station, vantage point (VP) or observation point (OP) is typically selected for maximum vantage over long distances. The maximum survey radius and session duration are established before the surveys begin, and the observers follow a survey schedule that varies according to wind farm size and available budgets. Detected birds are identified to species level, using binoculars if necessary, and counted, and the counts are divided by the session duration to arrive at use rates. By changing the location and restricting the area surveyed, diurnal use surveys can be easily adapted to meet the requirements of scenario B or C in Figure 1.1.
