The California Condor Gymnogyps californianus (Figure 9.4) has been considered federally endangered in North America since 1967 and by California since 1971 (Battistone 2014). Projects within or near the birds protected habitat must abide by federal and state laws to ensure the safety of the species. The Alta East Wind Energy Facility project did not fall within the condors habitat area but had the possibility to do so in the future, so steps were taken to ensure the future safety of these birds if they were to come within range or even within wind farm airspace. The largest concern is, if they approach the wind farm, what measuresshould be in place.;Figure 9.4 Although still one of the worlds most endangered birds, there were 228 California Condors flying free in the wild in 2014, more than the number retained in captivity (USFWS 2015). The number and colour of the wing tags on each wing identify the individual. (Phil Armitage, Creative Commons);The wind farms adaptive management strategy for the California Condor over the 30year operational life of the project is the first of its kind implemented with first the legal taking (e.g. killing or harming) of this species (Streater 2013). Project developers worked with conservation groups and state departments in deciding what steps to take if future issues occur. As the VHF transmitters would eventually be phased out, the facility agreed to install the VHFdetection system during the first few years of operation and then replace it with an alternative
