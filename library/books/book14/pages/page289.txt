The review of the current state of knowledge of mitigationundertaken for this chapter illustrated that a wide spectrum of mitigation measures have been proposed, developed and applied during the different development stages (i.e. preconstruction, construction and operation) of a wind farm (Table 9.1). Measures include facility characteristics such as the size and design of the wind facility, construction periods, habitat enhancement and habitat replacement and even repowering can be included as a mitigation measure as fewer, larger turbines can be better spatially placed so that they no longer have an impact on a particular species (see Chapter 7 in this volume).;The reviews in this volume concluded that for birds, selective temporary shutdown of turbines to allow passage of migratory birds at minimal cost to energy production was especially effective (de Lucas et al. 2012 Tom et al. 2015 see Chapter 6 in this volume). Techniques to make turbines more visible to vulnerable birds are undergoing testing (Figure 9.3) (see Chapter 6 in this volume). For bats, curtailment by raising cutin speed or increasing lowspeed idling is thought to be the only effective option so far to reduce the number of collisions (see Chapter 8 in this volume). Other options, such as acoustic deterrents, show promise and warrant further research and development.;As the effectiveness of any mitigation measure is based on speciessiteseason specificity, further empirical evidence of the efficacy of particular measures for particular species is needed (Gartman et al. 2016b). For instance, the successful use of deterrence devices, whether visual (strobe or blinking lights) or acoustic (ultrasonic for bats), is dependent on habitat and foraging preferences of particular species. As such, deterrents, if proven effective, could best serve as supplementary measures to further minimise collision risk when combined with existing mitigation efforts such as curtailment.
