Preparing the technical basis for guiding wind turbine siting as part of repowering was a stepbystep process. Repowering has not happened all at once because the APWRA is composed of many wind projects owned by multiple companies on various land ownerships spanning two counties (Alameda and Contra Costa), and some wind turbine models deteriorated earlier than others. The 150 kW and 250 kW FloWind verticalaxis turbines were mostly inoperable by 2000 and removed from service in 2002. The 20.4 MW Diablo Winds project replaced these old generation turbines with 31 660 kW Vestas V47 turbines. The Buena Vista project was repowered next, replacing 179 75300 kW wind turbines with 38 1 MW Mitsubishi turbines that began operating in December 2006 (Figure 7.1). Both Diablo Winds and Buena Vista preceded the preparation of collision hazard models for guiding turbine siting.;Collision hazard models were first used to site turbines in 2010 at the Tres Vaqueros project, which has yet to replace 85 330 kW and 1 750 kW Howden wind turbines with 32 MW of modern turbines. More advanced siting models were applied to Vasco Winds, which replaced 726 KCS56 100 kW turbines and 20 KVS33 400 kW turbines with 34 2.3 MW Siemens turbines in 2011. The models for these projects were based on utilisation data collected from Vasco Caves Regional Preserve immediately adjacent to both projects. The first models based on behaviour as well as utilisation data were applied to the Golden Hills and Patterson Pass projects. Golden Hills replaced 80 MW of old turbines with 48 GE 1.79 MW turbines. Patterson Pass will replace 334 65 kW Nordtank turbines with about 13 modern wind turbines. Models based on behaviour data, and GPSGSM telemetry positions in the case of Golden Eagle, were applied to turbine siting in the 40 MW Golden Hills North project and the 36 MW Sand Hill project, where construction is imminent at the time of writing.
