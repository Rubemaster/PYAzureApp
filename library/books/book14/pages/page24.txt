Thermal and infrared imaging is available for nocturnal surveys of owls, nocturnal migrants and nocturnal activities of particular species that may be adversely affected by wind turbines, including energetics related to foraging. Thermal imaging was first used in wind farms to quantify behavioural responses of bats to wind turbines (Horn et al. 2008 , Cryan et al. 2014), but has also been used to calculate passage rates of bats, foraging owls and nocturnal migrants through or near the rotors of wind turbines (Smallwood, unpublished data). Thermal cameras mounted on tripods can be panned for 360degree scans or fixed on particular wind turbine rotors during timed sessions, as required for scenario C in Figure 1.1.;Figure 1.1 Hypothetical use survey design scenarios intended to inform micrositing of four candidate wind turbine sites (numbered open circles). In scenario A, surveys generate use rates within a plot that fails to cover turbine 1 and is too large for differentiating use rates among turbines 24 or for achieving equitable detection rates across the plot (detection rates decline with lesser shading of grey from 0 to 800 m of the station). In B, each candidate wind turbine site is assigned a dedicated survey station to generate use rates more representative of each site. In C, surveys are directed towards each turbine site to quantify comparable passage rates within the airspace that will expose birds to collision risk once turbines are installed. In D, individual birds are tracked visually and mapped to count flight path intersections with each analytical grid cell. These flight paths may be associated with specific behaviours and interactions with other birds, and each grid cell can be associated with terrain features so that predictive models can be developed from wind, terrain, activity level and behaviour.
