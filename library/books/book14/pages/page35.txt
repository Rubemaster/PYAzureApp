APWRA (1) an 18month study in Vasco Caves Regional Preserve (Smallwood et al. 2009b) (2) 2 years of postconstruction monitoring at the Buena Vista Wind Energy project (Insignia Environmental, unpublished data 2011) and (3) 6 years of monitoring at existing wind turbines throughout the APWRA by the Alameda County Avian Monitor (Alameda Monitor) and overseen by the Alameda County Scientific Review Committee (SRC). APWRA use surveys involved ontheminute recording of locations and numbers of birds seen, except for at Buena Vista, where birds were recorded on the halfminute. Locations were plotted as points on handheld maps of the survey area, and attributes such as species, number, height above ground and behaviour were recorded into voicerecorders or on the margin of the handheld maps, depending on the study. Mapped locations were then digitised as point features in ArcMap geographic information system (GIS) layered on to a digital elevation model (DEM).;Bird use data at Vasco Caves Regional Preserve were collected weekly from 15 stations from June 2006 to September 2007, totalling 774 onehour sessions mostly in an area without wind turbines, but also among 330 kW Howden turbines and 120 kW Nordtank turbines (Smallwood et al. 2009b). Raptors and corvids were recorded out to 600 m from each station, totalling 7,699 observations. Monthly surveys were performed February 2008 to January 2010 at six stations at the Buena Vista Wind Energy Project, including four stations amid the 38 1 MW Mitsubishi wind turbines and 2 stations outside the wind turbines. Over a maximum survey radius of 800 m, a 30minute survey was performed on the morning and afternoon of each survey day for 96 surveys totalling 48 hours. On 11 April 2005, consultants working for one or more APWRA wind company began collecting use data within an 800 m radius from eight stations overlooking the Diablo Winds Energy project, and multiple stations were added throughout the APWRA by December 2005. Alameda County continued this monitoring for 8,863 surveys from April 2005 to October 2011, representing 1,847 hours of survey time.;Advocating for standards in quantifying bird movements in proposed wind farms, Gauthreaux (1995) prioritised reducing the variation in observer skills. Since Gauthreaux (1995), biologists performing use surveys in baseline studies have ranged in skill from entry level to trained ornithologists. Of course, the skills of entry level biologists improve with experience, especially with training and encouragement to seek professional feedback. Some North American studies lasted for only one or a few months, thereby
