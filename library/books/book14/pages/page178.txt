Figure 5.3 The combined Bulgarian bird risk (high, medium and low risk) and wind farm capacity map including the nine regions identified as being technically suitable for wind farm development (after Mateeva et al. 2013).;Maps identified key areas for individual species and groups using models of bird abundance and distribution combined with geographic considerations such as rainfall and land use. Risk maps were then created for individual species and groups of species based on the bird key area maps and data on recorded impacts such as collision and disturbance. Areas of combined high, medium and low risk for birds were identified (Figure 5.3). Assessments of technical capacity identified nine regions in Bulgaria with the potential to support wind energy prior to including the risk maps. Wind resource, power line infrastructure and electricity consumption were included in the assessment. Restrictions to wind farm construction by law, such as National Protected Areas, Natura 2000 and areas within 500 m of settlements, were excluded from the technical capacity map. The bird risk maps and the technical capacity map were then overlain to produce the final map (Figure 5.3). Estimation of the total capacity in medium and lowrisk areas suitable for wind farm development, albeit with mitigating measures likely to be needed in the former, shows that these give possibilities to meet national targets for renewable energy while avoiding the most sensitive areas for birds.
