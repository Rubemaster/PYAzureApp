Figure 6.3 Vulture migration at the Tarifa wind farm eliciting temporary shutdown. (Migres Foundation);Rather than relying on measures to reduce collisions once the site is operational, it would be better to design sites that are less dangerous to Griffon Vulture and other soaring birds in the first place. To provide insight into how Griffon Vultures use wind currents to fly with minimum energetic cost, de Lucas et al. (2012b) used a wind tunnel installation to simulate the predominant wind flows and topography within a scale model of a wind farm to predict the flight trajectories of birds. The simulated flight trajectories and previously observed flight routes of Griffon Vultures were not significantly different, indicating that their flight routes matched the predominant wind flows in the area. This scaledmodel modelling approach foresees dangerous wind turbine locations during the preconstruction wind farm design phase. Such simulations to predict flight routes over complex terrain can aid micrositing of wind turbines and thereby reduce soaring bird mortality (de Lucas et al. 2012b), as also described in the section Minimise ecofriendly architecture.
