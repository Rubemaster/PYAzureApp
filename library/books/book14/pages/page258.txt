Brinkmann et al. (2011) used a mixture model to describe correlations between bat fatalities, acoustic activity and windspeed (KornerNievergelt et al. 2013). This model demonstrated a significant positive correlation between bat activity at the nacelle and number of bat fatalities found at the turbine. Nights with acoustic bat activity and wind speeds between 3 and 6 metres per second were identified as being especially dangerous in terms of collisions (Figure 8.4). An average of 1012 bat fatalities per turbine and year was estimated for the turbines sampled. A second model (GLMM) was used to predict bat activity, that is, periods of high collision risk for bats, at a specific turbine from month, time of night and wind speed. Combining the two statistical models, batfriendly curtailment algorithms for implementation were developed (Behr et al. 2011b).;Figure 8.4 Collision rates predicted from the median wind speed and the number of acoustic recordings per night (KornerNievergelt et al. 2013). Collision rates are colour coded from low to high, represented by pale yellow (0.02 bats per night) to dark red (0.3 bats per night), respectively. Histograms show the distribution of wind speed and acoustic recordings. Small dots indicate the nights sampled, mediumsized dots indicate nights with a carcass found, and large dots indicate nights with two carcasses found.;This operational mitigation method is based on standardised acoustic data acquisition (usually during at least 2 years after construction of turbines), data analysis and risk assessment. Turbinespecific cutin wind speeds are used to reduce the number of bat collisions. Below the cutin windspeed, the rotors
