Environmental studies, typically referred to as baseline studies in North America, often precede construction of new wind farms to assess potential impacts on birds, bats and other wildlife. This process is analogous to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) adopted in Europe. Wind farms can adversely affect birds in several ways (1) modifying or destroying habitat by the construction of wind turbine pads and access roads (2) displacing some birds that avoid the new facilities (Leddy et al. 1999 Whitfield  Madders 2006 PearceHiggins et al. 2009 Garvin et al. 2011 Langston 2013) and (3) injuring and killing birds when they collide with wind turbines (Smallwood  Thelander 2004 2005 de Lucas et al. 2007 2008 2012a Smallwood 2007 2013 Dahl et al. 2012). Less obvious impacts include collision of birds with turbine towers, birds being struck by automobiles on the access roads, electrocution of birds along electric circuit lines, on transformers or other electrical infrastructure, oiling of feathers of birds entering the nacelles, and entrapment of birds within nacelle and tower spaces. Despite the variety of wind farm impacts, most of the focus of preconstruction environmental assessments has been on the risks of collision with wind turbines.;Baseline studies typically include onsite surveys to assess utilisation as an indicator of relative abundance. Utilisation rates, also known as use rates, and usually expressed by the metric birds seen per unit time, are typically assessed by comparing them to use rates at other wind farms where impacts had also been estimated following postconstruction fatality surveys. Surveys to estimate use rates are typically intended to predict impacts so that an informed decision can be made whether the wind farm should be developed. According to the objectives typically appearing in baseline study reports, a longestablished secondary objective has often been to guide wind turbine siting, also known as micrositing, to minimise collisions with flying birds Morrison 1998 Anderson et al. 1999 California Energy Commission California Department of Fish and Game (CEC CDFG) 2007 see Chapters 16 and 17 in this volume.;An important element of baseline studies and EIAs is learning from the impacts already experienced at existing wind farms (New et al. 2015). Studying causal factors of fatalities at existing wind farms can help to predict impacts at new wind farms. It is important to learn how eagles and other birds react to wind turbines (Osborn et al. 1998 Leddy et al. 1999 Hoover  Morrison 2005 Smallwood et al. 2009a 2009c May et al. 2010 Dahl et al. 2013 Hull  Muir 2013 Kitano  Shiraki 2013). Also needed are more accurate fatality rate estimates for comparison with predictor variables such
