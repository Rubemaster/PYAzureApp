Thirdly, to be able to draw empirical conclusions a largenumber of studies following a methodology standard are needed (e.g. fatality search protocols). An increasing number of studies apply the beforeafter controlimpact (BACI) approach, which compares pre and postconstruction within the affected area as well as a control site. Comparative studies can establish standards, such as thresholds, which are often needed in impact assessments. To achieve a less heterogeneous research approach, substantial guidelines are required. The studies by Winder et al. (2015) and Strickland et al. (2011) are welldesigned examples.;Lastly, enhancing data accessibility can bridge the remaining knowledge gaps. Some examples of openly accessible online databases are GP Wind, the American Wind Wildlife Institutes Wind and Wildlife database, the WREN Hub, and the TEHTYS database for offshore wind energy projects. Through increased transparency of monitoring and research results, as well as improved cooperation by facility operators and scientists, improved mitigation and more efficient future planning of wind farms could be implemented. Data accessibility would also better establish a balance between economic interests and conservation interests, involving all stakeholders.;Figure 9.2 Wind turbines in an agricultural landscape, Germany. Such locations are often the most suitable to avoid conflicts with wildlife, although some priority species do inhabit such landscapes and careful micrositing or other mitigation measures may be required.
