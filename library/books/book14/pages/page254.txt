Previous studies indicate that a substantial portion of bat fatalities occur during relatively lowwind conditions during late summer to autumn (fall) periods coincident with bat migration (Arnett 2005 Arnett et al. 2008 Rydell et al. 2010a). Bats are known to significantly reduce their flight activity during periods of rain, low temperatures and strong winds (Erickson  West 2002 Reynolds 2006 Horn et al. 2008 Weller  Baldwin 2012), and risk to collision with wind turbines is likely to be reduced under theseconditions. Also, nonspinning turbine blades and turbine towers do not kill bats (Horn et al. 2008 Cryan et al. 2014). Thus, it has been hypothesised that altering turbine operations when bats are at greater risk could minimise fatalities (Kunz et al. 2007b Arnett et al. 2008).;Normally, turbines freewheel at wind speeds below the turbine manufacturers cutin speed, that is, the lowest wind speed at which turbines generate power to the utility system, which is usually 3.5 4.0 metres per second for modern turbines. Even though turbines are not producing electricity while freewheeling, they still may rotate at sufficiently high speed to be lethal to bats (Arnett 2005). Raising turbine cutin speed above that set by the manufacturer renders turbines nonoperational until the higher cutin speed is reached and turbines then begin to spin and produce power (Arnett et al. 2011) (Figure 8.2). Thus, raising turbine cutin speed during lowwind periods should indeed reduce bat kills.;In a synthesis of operational mitigation studies in the USA and Canada, Arnett et al. (2013c) reported that most studies they reviewed documented at least a 50 reduction in bat fatalities when turbine cutin speed was increased by at least 1.5 metres per second above the manufacturers cutin speed, with up to a 93 reduction in bat fatalities in one study (Arnett et al. 2011). Consultants reports in Germany (Behr  von Helversen 2006) and Portugal (Laboratory of Applied Ecology 2010) demonstrated that in comparison with normally operating turbines, respective reductions in bat fatalities of around 50 and 78.5 were achieved when turbine cutin speed was raised. In Canada, Baerwald et al. (2009) demonstrated equally beneficial reductions (about 60 fewer fatalities) with a lowspeed idling approach, where blades were pitched at 45 degrees and the generator speed required to start energy production was lowered. Young et al. (2011) discovered that feathering turbine blades (pitched 90 degrees and parallel to the wind) at or below the manufacturers cutin speed, when turbines produced no electricity into the power grid, resulted in up to 72 fewer bats being killed. This is significant, because most turbines spin at high speeds below their manufacturers cutin speed and are likely to kill bats when no electricity is being produced (Arnett et al. 2013c). More recently, situation and conditiondependent algorithms have been developed for wind turbine operating systems to reduce bat fatalities. These algorithms consider several parameters such as wind speed, ambient temperature, season and time of day, as well as recorded bat activities for defining a set of operation rules for wind turbines (KornerNievergelt et al. 2013),
