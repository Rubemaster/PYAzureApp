Using similar steps, a predictor variable termed Ridge orientation was created. Ridgelines were buffered by 10 m and the resulting ridgeline polygons classified by orientation north to south, north northwest to southsoutheast, northwest to southeast, westnorth west to eastsoutheast, west to east, westsouthwest to eastnorth east, southwest to northeast and southsouthwest to northnorth east. Flight paths crossing ridgelines were also buffered by 10 m and related to these Ridge orientation polygons in useand availability analysis.;FL modelling was used to predict the likelihood that each DEM grid cell would include an event involving a Golden Eagle and a Red tailed Hawk, where the event could be a fatality at a wind turbine, a specific flight behaviour, a flight passing over a ridge (where a wind turbine is likely to be sited), a social interaction or a dangerous interaction with a wind turbine. FL likelihood surfaces were first created by each event variable. The mean, standard deviation and standard error of each continuously measured predictor variable among the grid cells where each event was recorded, was calculated to form the basis from which FL membership was assigned to grid cells for continuous predictor variables. Depending on the pattern in the data, FL membership was assigned values of 1 whenever the value of the predictor variable was within a certain prescribed distance in value from the mean, often within 1 SD, but sometimes within 1 or 2 SE. FL membership values of 1 expressed confidence that grid cells with the corresponding value range for the predictor variable were likely to host a certain type of event. FL membership values of 0 were assigned to grid cells that were far from the mean value, usually defined by prescribed distances from the mean such as 2 SD from the mean. FL membership values of 0 expressed confidence that grid cells with the corresponding value range for the predictor variable were unlikely to host an event of a certain type. All other grid cells were assigned FL membership values according to the following formulae, assuming that the likelihood of occurrence of each species will grade gradually rather than abruptly across grid cells that vary in value of the predictor variable (Y)
