Figure 3.3 The factors responsible for the observed differential risk of collision with wind turbines of Whitebellied Seaeagle (above) and Tasmanian Wedgetailed Eagle (below) (both Rohan Clarke), with the latter seemingly at more risk than the former, remain unclear. The two species are, however, ecologically dissimilar in a number of ways, including diet (Olsen et al. 2006).;The Biosis model was used to estimate risk based on movement data collected before construction for populations of six Wedge tailed Eagles and four Whitebellied Seaeagles at risk per annum at each of the wind farms. State regulatory authorities required that the collision risk model be run with the accumulated sum of eagle movement data obtained during the entire period of both preconstruction and operation of the wind farms spanning the period from 1999 to 2009. For both species, avoidance was modelled at 0.99 for the static tower and nacelle of turbines, and at 0.90, 0.95, 0.98 and 0.99 for the moving rotor.
