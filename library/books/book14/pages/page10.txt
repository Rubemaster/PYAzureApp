Wind farms are seen to be an essential component of global renewable energy policy and the action to limit the effects of climate change. There is, however, considerable concern over the effects of wind farms on wildlife especially on birds and increasingly on bats. Environmental impact assessment, which has been adopted in many countries, should, in theory, reduce any impacts to an acceptable level. Although a wide range of monitoring and research studies have been undertaken, only a small body of that work appears to make it to the peerreviewed literature. The latter is, however, burgeoning, concomitant with the interest in the interactions between wind energy and wildlife as expressed by the continuing CWW (Conference on Wind Energy and Wildlife Impacts) series of international conferences on the topic. In 2015, 391 participants from 33 countries attended CWW 2015 in Berlin. This will hopefully be exceeded at Estoril in Portugal in September 2017. It is hoped that relationships with researchers in key global producers of wind energy such as China and India, and the emerging markets in Brazil and Africa can become established. Lessons learned in mostly temperate Europe and North America need to be applied to subtropical and tropical climes. Here, in areas with higher biodiversity, it will be even more critical first to understand and then reduce and hopefully eliminate impacts upon wildlife.
