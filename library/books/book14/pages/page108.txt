Birds are generally adept at avoiding obstacles within their flight space. Nevertheless, the capacity of birds to avoid turbine collisions has been a subject of considerable discussion in the literature and warrants due consideration and explanation. Percival et al. (1999)noted the importance of considering a birds ability to avoid a potential collision as it approaches a turbine. Avoidance is recognised at different spatial scales. The best definitions of these are provided by Cook et al. (2014) and are summarised as follows (1) macroavoidance occurs when a bird responds to the presence of the entire wind farm by flying around or over it (2) meso avoidance refers to the response in which birds fly within the overall wind farm but avoid collisions by choosing to fly only in the airspace between turbines and (3) microavoidance happens when a bird flying in close proximity to a turbine and that is otherwise on a collision course, does not in fact collide with the turbine (Figure 3.2). Macroavoidance eliminates any threat of collision and requires no consideration in risk modelling. On the other hand, microavoidance is of real relevance and discussion of turbine collision risk has routinely recognised its importance (e.g. Whitfield 2009).
