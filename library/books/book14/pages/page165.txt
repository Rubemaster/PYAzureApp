(Rodrigues et al. 2008 Natural England 2009). The presence of nearby hedgerows, rivers or lakes should also be taken into account, as bats will be more likely to forage in these areas (Rodrigues et al. 2008 Natural England 2009).;Assessment of the risk of a populationlevel impact is required, and a precautionary principle should be applied to conservation priority species and sites if the potential for a significant effect cannot be ruled out. Spatial data on migration routes for birds and bats can be limited (although see Box 5.1). As discussed in Designated sites, above, some of these biodiversity hotspots will be covered by site designations such as SPAs, but for others coverage is more limited. To identify sensitive areas for different species at an early stage in the planning process, speciesspecific data are required and sensitivity mapping is a useful way of displaying these.;Wind farm plans and programmes in the EU must undergo Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) under the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive (200142EC) on the evaluation of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (EU 2001) to evaluate their effects on the environment, whereas individual projects may require Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85337EEC as amended) on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (EU 2014). SEAs are primarily the responsibility of the relevant government department, and the SEA and EIA Directives are implemented via home legislation in each EU member state (Langston 2013). For developments in or affecting Natura 2000 sites (SPAs and SACs), an AA, which is generally a more stringent test than EIA, is usually necessary to determine the effect of the development of the integrity of the site. A negative effect upon the population of a designated species would be seen to be an adverse impact in this case.
