Figure 1.2 Burrowing Owl hovering in the rotor wake of 40 kW Enertech wind turbine just before dark in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA). At the times when diurnal surveys are performed, Burrowing Owls are almost always recorded as perched near their burrows.;If use rates are to be used for macro or micrositing, the analyst also needs to evaluate whether use data adequately represent the peaks, nadirs and intervening portions of any natural, multiannual population cycle that may or may not be linked to a climate cycle. Use data must be examined for biases and sources of uncertainty (Table 1.3). Biases need to be quantified to formulate more effective use surveys or to adjust use rates to account for the biases. Potential biases include (1) trends in detection rates with distance from the observer, (2) variation in the maximum survey radius (which relates to point 1), (3) variation in the visible portion of the airspace out to the maximum survey radius, (4) trends in detection rates with survey session duration, (5) differences in detection rates between visual backdrops such as sky versus terrain, and (6) variation in the maximum ceiling for counting birds. Along with quantifying biases, error should be calculated, reported and carried through calculations of rates.;To identify and quantify potential biases and sources of uncertainty, use data were collected from 93 baseline and post construction studies at 82 wind farms throughout North America during 2014, including 43 based on preconstruction surveys, 32 with postconstruction surveys (21 from the Altamont Pass, California), 7 with both pre and postconstruction surveys, and 54 with accompanying fatality rate estimates (Figure 1.3).
