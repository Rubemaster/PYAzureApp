2013), which are not available in all cases. The necessity to quantify potential impacts has triggered substantial research on fatality estimation approaches accounting for field bias, such as search efficiency, carcass removal and the proportion of searchable area underneath the turbines (Arnett et al. 2005 Bispo et al. 2013 KornerNievergelt et al. 2013). Furthermore, a few studies have been carried out using stable hydrogen isotope analysis to determine the origins of migratory bats killed at wind farms (Popa Lisseanu et al. 2012 Baerwald et al. 2014). Although such approaches advance and facilitate the assessment of potential impacts, uncertainties will inevitably always remain.;Table 9.1 Overview of mitigation measures applicable at different development stages (i.e. siting, construction, operation, decommissioning) and species groups.a
