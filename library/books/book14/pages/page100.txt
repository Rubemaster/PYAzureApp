Models to estimate collision risk can be broken down into a sequence of contributory elements. The sequence in which they are considered is not necessarily important and varies between collision risk models. The elements are (1) an element that describes and quantifies the mechanics of an interaction when a bird flies into the immediate zone occupied by a turbine and the potential for a collision thus exists (2) an element that evaluates the number of flights at risk of collision per unit time (3) an element that estimates the probability of a given flight interacting with a number of turbines during passage through the wind farm (4) application of a quantified microavoidance rate (see Avoidance rates, below) (5) an extrapolation from all of the above to determine a mean per annum number of flights at risk for the entire turbine array at the wind farm and (6) calculation of a mean annual rate of mortalities based on the number of birds making flights at risk of collision (Figure 3.1).
