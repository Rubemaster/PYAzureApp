The models estimates of annual collisions, based on the combined total of movement data from preconstruction and operation of the wind farms from 1999 until 2009 (Table 3.1), compare well with actual mortality of the eagle species at both wind farms (Table 3.2). The models estimate of the number of Wedgetailed Eagle collisions per annum at Bluff Point at a 0.95 avoidance rate was 1.5, which is the same as the mean number of documented mortalities per annum. Estimates provided for this case by model iterations for 0.90 and 0.95 avoidance rates fell within the 95 confidence interval of measured mortality rates. The models estimates for number of collisions at a 0.95 avoidance rate for Whitebellied Seaeagles at Bluff Point (0.5) and for Wedgetailed Eagles at Studland Bay (1.1) (Table 3.1) alsoclosely approximated the mean numbers of documented mortalities per annum for the two species, at 0.4 and 1.0, respectively (Table 3.2). For those cases, the models estimates for the range of avoidance rates between 0.90 and 0.99 fell within the 95 confidence interval of measured mortality rates. No Whitebellied Seaeagle collisions have been reported from Studland Bay so, to date, the models estimates are higher than actual experience for that species there.;Table 3.1 Modelled mean annual turbine collision estimates for both Whitebellied Seaeagle and Wedgetailed Eagle based on movement data collected over the span of preconstruction and operation of Bluff Point and Studland Bay wind farms from 1999 to 2009.;Estimates are shown for four potential dynamic avoidance rates. Static avoidance rate was modelled at 0.99 in all cases.;Table 3.2 Average annual mortality rate and variance for both White bellied Seaeagle and Wedgetailed Eagle based on carcasses detected at both Bluff Point and Studland Bay wind farms from 20022012 and 20072012, respectively.;Population modelling offers a framework for understanding the effects of predicted collision mortality on the viability of entire populations of the species of interest. PVA has sometimes been used for this purpose and PBR may be applicable where less precise demographic information is available. However, each of these models has requirements that may limit their application to mortality estimates for single wind farms, although their greater
