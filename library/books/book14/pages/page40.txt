There has been no reported effort to quantify the effects of variation in the number of target species during use or behaviour surveys. The degree to which use counts will be biased low by including all species in the counts, as opposed to only raptors or only one type of raptor, remains unknown. In the case of APWRA behaviour surveys, the protocol encourages observers to track onebird at a time according to a hierarchy of priority species, so the number of target species should not matter. For example, if an observer has two Redtailed Hawks within the survey area, then the nearer one is selected for observation, but the observer will switch observations to a Golden Eagle should one subsequently enter the area.;Figure 1.6 Use rates measured as first detections per hour of all raptors and Redtailed Hawk, the most frequently occurring species, varied greatly up to 1.2 minutes (0.02 hours) per survey plot per hectare of planned wind farm, and then stabilised at low levels, with greater survey efforts among North American wind farms.;Another potential source of bias and uncertainty is variation in the volume of airspace under observation. At the APWRA, the only North American wind resource area where visible volumes of airspace have been quantified, the airspace that was visible from the observation station decreased with increasing distance from the observer, while the variation in the visible airspace increased among stations (Figure 1.7). The visible volume of airspace over unobstructed, flat terrain within a 600 m radius and 140 m ceiling would be 158,336,270 m3, or 0.1583 km3, but over the complex terrain of the APWRA the latter ranged from 0.1299 to 0.1919 km3 owing to hills rising above observation stations and valleys descending below. Relative to the airspace that would be expected of flat terrain, this variation in visible airspace due to complex terrain translated into an initial reduction of visible airspace with increasing distance to about 183 m from the observer, followed by a gradual increase until the volume of airspace observable was about the same at 600 m on average from the observer. To account for the variation in visible airspace among stations, avian use rates were calculated as the number of birds per hour per cubic kilometre of visible airspace within a 140 m ceiling.
