Figure 8.5 Mounting acoustic deterrent devices on the nacelle of a wind turbine in July 2009 at the Locust Ridge Wind Farm in Pennsylvania, USA (Michael Baker) (above), and three acoustic deterrent devices mounted on one side of the nacelle of a wind turbine (Edward B. Arnett) (below).;Acoustic deterrent devices (hereafter referred to as deterrents) projecting broadband ultrasound have been further developed and investigated as an approach to reducing bat fatalities at wind facilities (Figure 8.5). Arnett et al. (2013b) tested a deterrent (Figure 8.6) emitting broadband ultrasound in the 20110 kHz range and found that, after accounting for inherent variation among sample turbines, bat fatalities were reduced by up to 64 at turbines with deterrent devices relative to control turbines. The Arnett et al. (2013b) study, and previous experiments with earlier prototypes (see www.batsandwind.org for study reports), suggests that broadband ultrasound broadcasts may reduce bat fatalities by discouraging them from approaching the sound source that interferes with their echolocation. Zeale et al. (2014) used the
