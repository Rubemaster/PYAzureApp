Bird and bat collisions with wind turbines occur at variable frequencies around the world. Predictive modelling to estimate the number of collision mortalities of vulnerable taxa is widely used as part of environmental impact assessments for proposed wind farms. This chapter provides an overview of six collision risk models that are in use at the time of writing andor have been described in the peerreviewed literature. All are designed to provide estimates of average numbers of bird mortalities that may occur at a wind farm. The Band, Podolsky, Biosis and Hamer models have a basis in the mechanical interaction of a bird with a wind turbine, as originally conceived by Tucker. Common conceptual aspects include the requirement for empirical information about bird usage of the proposed site alongside specifics of turbines and their configuration in the landscape. Aspects that are common to, or differentiate, these models include their capacity to model for birds flying towards a turbine from any angle whether risk is presented by the whole turbine or just the moving rotor, whether flights are assumed to be in a straight path, and whether the result is measured in number of flights at risk or number of potential bird mortalities. In contrast to the other models, the Bayesian approach adopted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service model primarily requires inputs derived from empirical experience of collisions at other wind farms. Overall, the determination of simple numbers of mortalities is less important than the impact of collision losses on the viability of threatened fauna populations. Demographic population modelling approaches, including population viability analysis (PVA) and potential biological removal (PBR), can be used to evaluate any impact. PVA requires detailed demographic information and may be best applied to regionalscale effects of multiple wind farms. PBR
