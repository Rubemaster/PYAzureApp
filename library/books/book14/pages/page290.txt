Figure 9.3 The design, size and deliberate coloration of turbines, such as here at Ellern wind farm in Germany, helps to minimise impacts on wildlife. (Juliane Bauer);Importantly, mitigation measures may not be suitable for every site. To gain not only social but also socioeconomic acceptance, the practicability and applicability of mitigation options are of major importance in terms of both the costs and the required planning effort. Temporal and spatial landuse management of turbines and wind farm surroundings could be beneficial in deterring or luring vulnerable species away, requiring close cooperation among all stakeholders to ensure successful and continuous implementation.
