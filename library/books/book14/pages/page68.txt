Bat activity also varies temporally, including within and among nights, seasons and years (Hayes 1997). Detectors should be programmed to record throughout the night from at least a half hour before sunset to half an hour after sunrise during the study period (Strickland et al. 2011). Study duration should encompass the life history traits of bats, such as reproduction and migration, which may vary by elevation, latitude and species. It is often recommended to monitor between spring and autumn (fall), which generally corresponds to the period of highest activity and highest period of risk for bats (USFWS 2012 Rodrigues et al. 2015) (Table 2.2). However, if bats are active throughout the year, as is the case in parts of southern Europe (Georgiakakis et al. 2012 Camina 2012), a full year of monitoring may be necessary. Typically, only one year of monitoring is recommended, which will help to account for nightly and seasonal variations in activity, but multiple years of surveys are required to address interannual variation.;Bats are known to restrict their activity under certain weather conditions, such as during periods of rain, low temperatures and strong winds (Erickson  West 2002). In the USA, clear patterns of activity at preconstruction sites have been observed showing a positive relationship with temperature and a negative relationship with wind speed (Arnett et al. 2006 Redell et al. 2006 Reynolds 2006 Weller  Baldwin 2011). The consistency of these patterns inspired the concept of feathering turbine blades during low wind speed conditions to reduce bat fatalities (see Chapter 18 in this volume). Other weather variables may also be important. Baerwald and Barclay (2011) observed the negative influence of wind
