Figure 3.2 Conceptual examples of (a) macroavoidance of a wind farm, (b) mesoavoidance within a wind farm, and (c) microavoidance of a turbine within the wind farm.;Microavoidance may include cognitive behaviour in which a bird becomes aware of danger and takes evasive action, or simple chance resulting in inadvertent safe passage between turbine blades. For the purposes of collision risk modelling, a microavoidance rate is important but the reason it occurs is not. An avoidance parameter may be incorporated into a model at any stage by simply scaling the number of movements at risk by (1  v), where v is a measure of the birds ability to avoid objects. Thus, with an avoidance rate of 0.90,
