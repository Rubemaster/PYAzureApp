 It is strongly recommended that population models should be used strategically to determine sustainable mortality limits for populations of threatened species before assessment of risk for individual wind farms. This will provide an appropriate context in which to evaluate predictions of collision risk or mortality results of operational wind farms. PVA and similar population modelling is the preferred approach where knowledge of demographic values is sufficient to support its use, but where that level of information is not known, demographic modelling using PBR should be used.;Thanks are due to Tom Hamer and Greg Forcey for providing explanatory information about their models. The chapter draws on information gleaned over more than 10 years and many people have contributed to my understanding of collision risk. In particular, I thank Stuart Muir, Elizabeth Stark and Cindy Hull. Michael McCarthy and Mark Burgman provided early insights into mathematical modelling. Origin Energy, Hydro Tasmania and Woolnorth Holding Pty Ltd kindly allowed the use of case histories from their wind farms. I am grateful to my colleagues and directors at Biosis who have participated in my own involvement in collision risk modelling for wind farms and who facilitated my writing of this chapter. Kailash Willis and Rohan Clarke kindly gave permission for use of photographs. I am indebted to the editorial expertise of Martin Perrow, which substantially improved the chapter.;Abadi, F., Gimenez, O., Arlettaz, R.  Schaub, M.
