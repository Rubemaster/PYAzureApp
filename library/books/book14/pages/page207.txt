At the end of the life of a wind farm, decommissioning shouldensure that the original status of a wind farm footprint is restored. Otherwise, prolongation or repowering may be undertaken. The potential for repowering is expected to be extensive and has already commenced in Denmark, Germany, Spain, California and India (del Ro et al. 2011). Repowering allows the redesign of the wind farm layout within the existing footprint, thus further minimising environmental impacts in the landscape (see also Minimise eco friendly architecture, above). However, repowering also necessitates partial restoration of the wind farm footprint with respect to discontinued structures. Little operational experience exists on the political, economic and environmental aspects of decommissioning (Ferrell  DeVuyst 2013). Still, restoration ecology represents a wellestablished scientific discipline that may also provide the framework and guidelines for ecological restoration of wind farms (Clewell et al. 2005 Aradottir  Hagen 2013). SteckyEfantis (2013) evaluated four decommissioning plan reports in Ontario, Canada, concluding that planning and restoration standards, in particular, could be improved. Scottish Natural Heritage has commissioned an indepth review to provide guidance on the restoration and decommissioning of onshore wind farms (Welstead et al. 2013).;Figure 6.5 Cole and Dahl (2013) proposed retrofitting power line poles to reduce Whitetailed Eagle electrocution as a compensatory measure for collision fatalities at the Smla wind farm in Norway.
