Figure 8.3 Microphone discs of three different detector systems and additional temperature and light sensor (small black capsules) installed in the bottom of the nacelle of a wind turbine. Further detail of their placement and structure is shown in the inset (white square).;Bat activity at the nacelle of 70 turbines at 35 sites in five geographic regions in Germany was continuously sampled with calibrated Anabat SD1 (Titley Scientific) and Batcorder 1.0 (ecoObs GmbH) acoustic detectors from April to October of 2007 and 2008. At 30 of these turbines, daily fatality searches were conducted from July to October of the same year. Scavenging rate and searcher efficiency were measured in additional field experiments and the proportion of carcasses in the area searched was quantified (Niermann et al. 2011).;Acoustic activity was measured at the nacelle of turbines with the microphones of detectors facing downwards through a hole in the bottom of the nacelle (Figure 8.3). This position was chosen to reduce the impact of wind and rain on the microphones. To allow for standardised and reliable data acquisition, detector systems with calibrated microphones, remote status access and automated bat call recognition were used, operated with standardised configuration and settings (Behr et al. 2011a).
