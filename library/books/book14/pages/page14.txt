Studies are usually performed before the development of a wind farm to determine whether the study area, or specific locations within the study area, will pose an unreasonable avian collision risk. It has long been suspected that the terrain presents an uneven collision risk by channelling bird activity, and preconstruction surveys can inform sound decisions over wind turbine layout. Post construction surveys are also needed to measure displacement and barrier effects, improve understanding of wind turbine collision mechanisms and test the efficacy of mitigation measures. Visual scans have been favoured for obtaining use rates to be compared to use and fatality rates elsewhere and to predict fatality rates at a proposed wind farm. This chapter reviews those survey methods for wind farm assessment. It then examines use rates in North America for sources of bias and uncertainty and whether use rates are predictive. Use rates are compared from 82 wind farms, including 43 based on preconstruction surveys, 32 with postconstruction surveys (21 from the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area in California, USA), 7 with both pre and postconstruction surveys and 54 with accompanying fatality rate estimates. Potential biases are serious and sources of uncertainty are many, meaning that use rates are often poor predictors of fatality rates. The assumptions used to justify survey methods need testing and efforts to standardise methods need more effective direction. Use surveys can be improved and telemetry expanded, and radar, thermal imaging and behaviour surveys should be developed for predicting and minimising avian collision impacts at wind farms.
