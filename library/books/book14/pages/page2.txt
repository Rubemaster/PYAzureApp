This work is dedicated to my family my wife Eleanor, with whom I share a vision of a better future for our planet my children Merlin and Phoenix who are still young enough to wonder, and Morgan and Rowan, who took their place in society as women somewhere along the way and my Mum and Dad. My Mum was taken from us before these books were completed and is acutely missed.
