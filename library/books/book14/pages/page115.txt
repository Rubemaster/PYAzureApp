Substantial investigations of Tasmanian Wedgetailed Eagle Aquila audax fleayi and Whitebellied Seaeagle Haliaeetus leucogaster (Figure 3.3) have been undertaken at Bluff Point and Studland Bay wind farms in northwestern Tasmania, Australia. These have included utilisation surveys designed to measure eagle activity before and after development of the wind farm and post construction carcass searches (Hull et al. 2013). Commissioning of turbines began at Bluff Point Wind Farm in 2002 and at Studland Bay Wind Farm in 2007. Bluff Point Wind Farm consisted of 37 Vestas V66 turbines in a scattered array on an area of 1,524 ha. Studland Bay Wind Farm is situated 3 km south of Bluff Point and comprised 25 Vestas V90 turbines in a scattered array over an area of 1,410 ha. Both wind farms border the coast of north western Tasmania and both eagle species are resident at the sites.;Movement data for both species were collected during point counts at Bluff Point Wind Farm site in 3 years before construction of turbines and in 4 years after they began operating. At Studland Bay, they were collected in 6 years before turbine construction and in 3 years after turbines commenced operation. As prescribed by the regulatory authorities, point counts were undertaken in the austral autumn and spring. Ten replicate point counts were made in each season at 18 locations per wind farm. There were 545 point counts undertaken at Bluff Point between 1999 and 2007 and 854 point counts at Studland Bay between 1999 and 2009.
