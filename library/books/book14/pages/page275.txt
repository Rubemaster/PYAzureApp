Interactions between wind energy and wildlife have been a focus of intensive research, as an attempt to address any unintended negative sideeffects and promote a winwin situation for renewable energy and biodiversity. In quantifying the impacts of wind farms (e.g. bird collisions, bat barotrauma, displacement of birds and larger mammals), efforts to narrow knowledge gaps and provide informed decisionmaking guidance have been showcased through international symposia, and through database building and collaborative actions, landmark conferences and community building milestone research projects. This chapter aims to provide a best practice approach for environmentally sound wind energy development within the available framework of international policy, legislation and guidance. To begin, a review is provided of current wildlifesensitive planning, construction and operation measures embedded within the basic mitigation sequence to avoid, minimise, reduce and compensate impacts and ultimately restore habitats and species. The importance of sound baseline studies, impact appraisals of significance, statutory requirements, comprehensive mitigation approaches and followup processes once a permit has been issued (e.g. monitoring and adjustments) is highlighted. Spatial planning and zoning empowered by environmental and biological impact assessments can provide successful macroavoidance strategies to circumnavigate sensitive biodiversity hotspots. Microavoidance mitigation approaches, such as siting individual turbines away from bird flight lines or favoured areas (e.g. ridges) and curtailing normal turbine operation by increasing cutin speed (bats) or temporary shutdown (birds), can further minimise unintended effects. Critically, the concept of
