This chapter describes statistical methods that combine data from detection probability models and observed carcass counts to provide unbiased estimates of the total number of bird andor bat fatalities having occurred at a site over a specific, usually extensive, period of time. In the first three themes, three major sources of imperfect detection of carcasses and the influence of the accuracy and precision of estimated detection parameters on the ultimate accuracy and precision of fatality estimates are described. In thefourth theme, a comparison is made between several different statistical approaches that have been proposed in the literature, each with different assumptions regarding the factors described earlier, to combine detection probability models with observed counts to estimate fatality at wind power facilities. The final theme discusses the unique issues presented when the observed carcass count is zero, which can often be the case when fatality monitoring is motivated by potential impacts on a rare or endangered species. Although the examples are taken from studies on bats in Europe and North America, the statistical approaches discussed here are equally applicable to birds or bats in any part of the world.;Attention is focused on measuring turbinecaused fatality rates, but this forum cannot provide a rigorous quantitative comparison among methods of modelling the factors that contribute to imperfect detection. In addition, assessment of effects of turbine caused fatality on population dynamics or risk to populations (as opposed to individuals), and how those effects are evaluated in a cultural, economic or social context in different countries, for example in regulations, attitudes about conservation, and approaches to costbenefit analysis of green energy, are beyond the scope of this chapter.;The necessary considerations for monitoring study design are similar whether the objective of a monitoring study is to estimate total numbers of bird and bat fatalities or to estimate the upper credible limit below which the true number of fatalities is most likely to lie. All monitoring studies will need to account for imperfect detection of carcasses that arises by any or all three of the following factors (1) a fraction of the total lands lies outside the searched area (2) a fraction of carcasses is scavenged or removed by wind, or deteriorates beyond recognition (3) a fraction is missed by the searchers. The associated parameters representing the fraction landing within the searched area, the fraction persisting to potentially be found and the fraction found are referred to as a, r and p, respectively, in the sections below.
