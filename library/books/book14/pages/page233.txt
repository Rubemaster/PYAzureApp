Further terrain measurements have been added since Smallwood et al. (2009a). Because percent up slope did not distinguish a grid cells position between slopes on large versus small hills, the variable hill size was derived to express the local topographic influence of the feature, where each cell was located by taking the elevation difference between the nearest valley bottom polygon and nearest ridge top polygon. Major hill size was the elevationdifference between the nearest major valley bottom and nearest major ridge top. Breaks in slope were characterised with the ratio of slope to gross slope, and the ratio gross slope to major gross slope was also calculated. The study area was divided into smaller polygons of land with like aspect, creating a predictor variable termed Subwatershed orientation. Existing subwatershed polygons had already been created between ridgelines and valley bottom lines. These watershed polygons were further divided by reviewing existing twofoot hypsography (contour) data and then dividing them into orientation polygons where the overall orientation of the contours changed. An orientation line feature layer was digitised with a line for each new polygon following the best observed orientation of that polygons contours. Python scripts attributed the new line with its compass orientation, that is N, NNE, NE, and so on. These lines were nondirectional, so a compass value could be either the returned value or the direction 180 degrees opposite. These same scripts calculated a perpendicular compass direction to the returned orientation line direction, which had two possible values differing by 180 degrees based on which side of the ridge the line described. A reference point within each orientation polygon was georeferenced by scripts to a generalised aspect grid of the study area. The scripts determined the correct perpendicular orientation and calculated the compass direction of the polygons orientation.
