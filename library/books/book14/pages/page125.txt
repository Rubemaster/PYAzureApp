Quantitative collision risk and population models are valuable toolsin wind farm EIA. The explicit nature of mathematical modelling has intrinsic merit, providing transparency in the evaluation of risks and potential impacts on populations of concern.;While the results of collision risk modelling have too rarely been validated against reallife collision numbers, the limited available results (e.g. Whitfield 2009 Smales et al. 2013) suggest that subsequent reallife experience for the species and wind farms concerned coincided well with the estimated ranges provided by collision risk modelling.;Some models, such as the Band and Biosis collision risk models, have been refined as the wind energy industry has progressed, and further improvements can be expected as understanding of birds responses to wind farms increases. Mathematical models are built with the explicit capacity for refinement, and improved understanding of aspects such as real avoidance rates are encouraged and are expected to be incorporated into future revisions of existing collision risk models. Additional improvements, such as better capacity to evaluate variable risk within a wind farm, are also anticipated. The USFWS model is explicitly intended to incorporate collision experience from the early operational stage of a wind farm to be utilised in later evaluations of the future risks that it poses.; Results of collision risk modelling should be expressed as ranges bounded by a lowest reasonable avoidance rate. Expressed in this manner, outputs of collision risk modelling offer an informed basis for understanding the potential range of mortalities that may occur and, in turn, this is useful for decision making underpinned by impact assessment.
