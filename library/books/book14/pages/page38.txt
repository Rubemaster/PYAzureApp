Figure 1.4 Mean (and 90 confidence interval) monthly use rates measured in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) for Golden Eagle (top) and American Kestrel (bottom), illustrating interannual variation, especially in the former, and seasonal variation, especially in the latter.;The United States Fish and Wildlife Service interim guidelines (USFWS 2003) recognised the need for multiple years of pre construction surveys, which is why they recommended 3 years to identify seasonal peaks of abundance. In contrast, preconstruction use surveys at 55 North American wind farms averaged 8 months and 22 days in duration, which by definition would not detect inter annual variation in avian abundance. Both fatality rates and use rates can vary greatly between years at a given study site (Smallwood  Neher in press). It can be especially misleading to rely on only one year, or less, of use surveys if those surveys were performed at either the nadir or peak of a species multiannual cycle of abundance.;Preconstruction survey effort across North America declined rapidly with increasing study area size (Figure 1.5), indicating a potential bias. The potential for a bias due to differential survey effort was supported by the greatest variation in use rates being reported among the smaller study areas (Figure 1.6). In other
