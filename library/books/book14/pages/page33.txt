To identify and quantify potential biases and sources of uncertainty, use data were collected from 93 baseline and post construction studies at 82 wind farms throughout North America during 2014, including 43 based on preconstruction surveys, 32 with postconstruction surveys (21 from the Altamont Pass, California), 7 with both pre and postconstruction surveys, and 54 with accompanying fatality rate estimates (Figure 1.3). Attributes ofeach use study were also recorded, including location group of birds observed, such as raptors or all birds calendar year of monitoring start and end dates duration (years) times of day when surveys were performed duration of survey session (hours) numbers of surveys and stations number of surveys per station interval (days) between surveys per station maximum survey radius (m) and whether visual scans, point counts or migration counts were used. Available maps of the survey plots were used to visually estimate the aggregated percentage overlap of the surveyed airspace among the plots. The number of detections of each species or larger taxonomic group was recorded, and use rates were calculated as the number of detections per hour. To standardise the rate metric, the number of survey hours was calculated as Number of stations  Number of surveys per station  Minutes per survey  60 minutes. These use studies comprised 22,851 surveys at 708 stations over 9,320 hours and spanned 39.38 years cumulatively. Pre construction surveys were devoted to over 5,723 MW of planned wind energy development on 287,956 ha.;Table 1.3 Sources of bias and uncertainty, their importance to use rates and whether they have been addressed.
