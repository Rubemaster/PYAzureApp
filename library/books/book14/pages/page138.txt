Understanding the relationship of carcass density to distance iscritical to being able to accurately estimate the proportion of carcasses expected to fall in the searched area (Huso  Dalthorp 2014). The density of turbinekilled carcasses decreases with increasing distance from a turbine, both because fewer carcasses land at greater distances and because the area equidistant from a turbine increases. In addition, it is not uncommon for the vegetation to become denser with distance, resulting in a coincident decrease in searcher efficiency as well as density. Therefore, models of carcass density need to account not just for distance but also for changes in searcher efficiency.;Without accounting for the proportion of carcasses falling outside the searched area, estimated fatality from studies conducted using different plot sizes and configurations cannot be meaningfully compared. Variation in search plot area and configuration can be accommodated by using accurate models of relative carcass fall patterns reflecting changing density with distance (Huso  Dalthorp 2014). Models estimating the relative density of carcasses with distance can be applied to any plot configuration and the actual count can be expanded by a factor equal to the inverse of the proportion expected to land in the searched area (Box 4.1).;Often, searches do not cover the whole area near turbines where carcasses may fall because of the difficulty and expense of searching plots that are large enough to encompass 100 of the carcasses and because there may areas within the search radius that are impractical to search owing to vegetation, uneven or dangerous ground, water or lack of landowners permission. Accurate fatality estimation requires accurate extrapolation from the searched areas to the unsearched areas. If carcasses were dispersed uniformly, then a simple area adjustment of dividing the estimated fatalities in the searched areas by the fraction of the area searched might be sufficient. However, carcass density decreases with distance from the turbine (Figure 4.1) because carcasses may be more likely to fall nearer to turbines (Hull  Muir 2010) and because carcasses are spread over greater areas at greater distances from turbines, and a simple area adjustment can yield strongly biased estimates (Huso  Dalthorp 2014). For estimates of fatality to be comparable across studies with varying sizes of search plots and varying searchable area within them, not only the area, but also the configuration and location of the
