Figure 7.8 Fuzzy logic likelihood surface classes of Golden Eagle ridge crossing and fatality locations (top) and Redtailed Hawk kiting, hovering and fatality locations (bottom) across the Contra Costa County portion of the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA). Colours represent hazard classes (14) from the lowest (1, light green) to the highest (4, red) likelihood of collision.;After 3 years of monitoring at the repowered Vasco Winds project, between pre and postrepowering, the fatality rate of Golden Eagles and Redtailed Hawk appears to have declined by about 80 and 40, respectively (K. Brown, K.S. Smallwood  B. Karas, unpublished data 2015). This effect of revised turbine layout in reducing fatalities could be attributed to the initial collision hazard model that was developed from utilisation data (not reported here) and the subsequent avoidance of hazard classes 3 and 4. Overlaying the model predictions based on the behaviour data reported here, most of the Golden Eagle fatalities were found at turbines located in collision hazard classes 3 and 4. However, improvements could be made to the collision hazard models, especially for Redtailed Hawk, as a result of collision hazard classes 3 and 4 missing from the central portion of the Vasco Winds project area (Figure 7.8). Despite the weaker Redtailed Hawk model, each new draft of the collision hazard models improved over the last, and the process has improved our understanding of wind turbine collision risk.
