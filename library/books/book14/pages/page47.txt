The reporting of the exposure index in tables at the end of baseline study reports has been implied to serve as a predictive tool, but the values have not been explicitly used to predict fatality rates, except for one case involving pooled Golden Eagle and Redtailed Hawk data (Madders  Whitfield 2006). To test whether fatality rates could be predicted from exposure index values, exposure index values were collected from nine baseline studies in Oregon and Washington, USA. However, fatality rates did not increase with increasing values of the exposure index among species. For each individual species fatality rates could not be accurately predicted from exposure index values among wind farms.;Figure 1.12 Annual fatality rates regressed on annual preconstruction use rates of all birds, all raptors, American Kestrel and Redtailed Hawk among all North American wind farms.
