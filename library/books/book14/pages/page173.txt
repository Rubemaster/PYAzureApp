The usual starting point in creating a sensitivity map is selection of the species or habitats for inclusion (Anderson et al. 1999). This should involve consideration of both conservation status and susceptibility to the effects of wind farm developments, principally collision risk and disturbance displacement. For bird species, the susceptibility to effects of wind farm development reviewed in Langston and Pullan (2003) has been updated by Gove et al. (2013),
