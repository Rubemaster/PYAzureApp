While generating about 700 gigawatthours (GWh) of renewable energy from wind turbines installed in the 1980s, the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) had been estimated to cause the deaths of 2,230 raptors and 9,300 total birds per year (Smallwood  Karas 2009), with these estimates likely to increase for small birds (and bats) as a result of changes in field and analytical methods. Given the poor success of mitigation measures applied to the oldgeneration wind turbines (Smallwood 2008), Smallwood and Karas (2009) recommended repowering the nearly 5,000 oldgeneration turbines to many fewer modern wind turbines within the APWRAs permitted 580 MW capacity, covering 16,760 ha of rolling hills (see Smallwood  Thelander 2008 for a description of the original wind turbines, land uses and environment). Operating at higher capacity factors, modern turbines generate more power and cause fewer avian fatalities, which can lessen further by carefully siting the turbines to avoid portions of the landscape where raptors and other birds more often perform certain behaviours thought to increase a birds vulnerability to wind turbine collision.;Figure 7.1 The Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) is undergoing repowering in phases, including the 2006 installation of 1 MW Mitsubishi turbines in the Buena Vista project (two turbines in the background), the 2011 installation of 2.3 MW Siemens turbines in the Vasco Winds project (middle), and the pending Golden Hills North project that will replace the 120 kW Bonus turbines (foreground).
