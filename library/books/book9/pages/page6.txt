will be of interest to, and have implications for a considerably broader audience than the statutory consultees defined in legislation.  The proposed development will create a new feature in an internationally renowned Firth, and will therefore have the potential to interact with many aspects of the existing societal, cultural, aesthetic commercial and environmental setting, both on and offshore. It is therefore vital that the organisations, communities and individuals, who have an interest in the project are able to be part of its development, and this Engagement Strategy aims to encourage and enable that involvement. This is in line with the views of the Department for Energy and Climate Change, who state  We believe that consultation is a critical part of the development process and should be undertaken with the public, relevant Local Authorities and key stakeholders with an interest in offshore wind farms, at the earliest opportunity during the development of projects.2  2. Engagement Plan Objectives Moray Offshore Renewables Limited want to work with the organisations, individuals and communities who have an interest in the project, whether as a result of their activities or their location. This will enable the development of offshore wind in the Outer Moray Firth to benefit from the considerable experience of the communities who live and work there, and will allow the project to develop with the involvement of the individuals and organisations affected by and interested in the development. 2.1 Primary Objectives of Engagement Stakeholder engagement comprises of two main elements communication and consultation. The former is the provision of information to enable stakeholders to understand the progress of the development, while the latter provides the opportunity for stakeholders to provide information and express views which influence the development. This is expressed as an overarching objective in the Scottish Governments Planning Advice Note PAN81Community Engagement, Planning With People, 2007  Effective community engagement means ensuring that people are made aware of proposals that affect them as early in the process as possible, that they have the fact to allow them to make a contribution, that they have had the opportunity to engage, and having made their views known , they get a clearer explanation of how and why decisions were made3
