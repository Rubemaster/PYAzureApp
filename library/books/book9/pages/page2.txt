The development of largescale offshore wind generation in the Outer Moray Firth will be a major innovation in electricity generation not just in the UK, but internationally. By its scale and nature, this project will be of interest to a large number of individuals, organisations and communities, especially those on Scotlands North East coast, and Moray Offshore Renewables Limited propose a strategy to encourage and enable them to be part of its development.
