Figure 3.10 Twinengined Partenavia P.68 equipped with bubblewindows used for visual observer aerial surveys. (Ansgar Diederichs);The maximum wind speed recommended for visual aerial surveys of birds is Beaufort 3 or a maximum wind speed of 18.5 kph (Camphuysen et al. 2004 BSH 2013). The main reason for this is the increased probability of not detecting all birds on the transect line at higher wind speeds. However, this standard was stretched to a maximum wind speed of 15 knots (27.8 kph) in surveys conducted around the UK (Department of Business Energy and Regulatory Reform (BERR), unpublished report 2007), potentially resulting in missed detections on the transect line.;The same assumptions relating to linetransect theory for boat based surveys (see Boatbased survey methods above, and Box 3.3) also apply to visual aerial surveys. It is likely that the speed of survey prevents positive responsive behaviour by seabirds, but it remains open to question whether negative responsive behaviour occurs in visual surveys for some species. Comparisons between visual and digital aerial survey methods both in the UK (Buckland et al. 2012) and Germany (Box 3.5) reported much higher abundance of Common Scoter Melanitta nigra for digital aerial methods than for equivalent visual aerial methods. What is not clear is whether the
