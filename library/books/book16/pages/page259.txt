Uncertainty over likely collision rates has meant that predicting collision risk as part of preconstruction Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has become a key part of the planning process (Masden  Cook 2016). This typically involves using data collected during preconstruction surveys within a collision risk modellingframework. In the UK, the most widely used model is the Band collision risk model (CRM) (Band 2012), although other models (e.g. Desholm 2006 Masden 2015 KleyheegHartman et al. 2018 McGregor et al. 2018) have been developed for use in the offshore environment. Given the prominence of collision risk in the decision making process for offshore wind farms (OWFs), the outputs from these models often form a key part of impact assessments and contributed to the decision to refuse planning consent for the Docking Shoal OWF (DECC 2012), and to the decision by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) to launch a judicial review of the decision to grant planning consent to four wind farms in the Firth of Forth (Scottish Courts and Tribunals 2016). Such problems may arise as a result of unresolved disagreements between different stakeholders about the parameters and models to be used in the assessment process (Box 5.1).;The questions below were derived by the chapter authors based on experiences with a similar exercise as part of Masden (2015). The responses reflect the opinions of Sue King, based on her experience and discussions with the representatives of the offshore wind industry.
