Webb et al. 2017 Zydelis et al. 2019). As a result of improved identification standards and the benefit of an auditable record of images, developers and regulators saw little need to commission boatbased surveys as part of either characterisation surveys or postconsent monitoring surveys. As a consequence, relatively few boatbased surveys are now undertaken in the UK, although such surveys are capable of delivering highquality data in relation to determining the effects of wind farms on seabirds (and marine mammals) in the UK (Vallejo et al. 2017 Harwood et al. 2017 Perrow 2019) as well as in other North Sea countries such as Belgium (Vanermen et al. 2015a 2015b).;Indeed, Vanermen  Steinen (2019) state that when aiming to monitor overall seabird responses to OWFs, there is not one method undeniably better than the other  In the end, the chosen method is likely to be a compromise between the study goals and the budget and logistics available to reach those goals. These are important considerations as offshore wind, and thus the need to assess and monitor its effects upon seabirds, expands around the globe (e.g. Normandeau Associates 2013 Williams et al. 2015 Jameson et al. 2019).;Owing to the rapid expansion of offshore wind generation and still limited knowledge of seabird responses to these installations, the scope of seabird distribution survey in relation to OWFs often goes beyond classical impact assessments of defined projects, which are restricted to characterisation studies. Seabird surveys are also required to monitor the predictions of the impact assessment during construction and operation of OWFs, such as to measure displacement effects and reveal possible impacts on populations.
