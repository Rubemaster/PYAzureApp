Figure 7.9 Sound mitigation at a piling energy of 800 kJ using a hydro sound damper system at Amrumbank West offshore wind farm (from Bruns et al. 2014) in a water depth of approximately 22 m. ML140 measurement location at 140 m from the piling site. Hydrophone recordings were taken at 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17 m above the seabed. SEL sound exposure level. (From Bruns et al. 2014);In a variation of the HSD concept, Wochner et al. (2016) developed arrays (trays) of underwater airfilled Helmholtz resonators, the AdBm system, which surround the noise source and are tuned to optimally attenuate noise in a frequency band of interest. Offshore tests with a fullscale prototype executed in the autumn of 2018 at a wind farm in the Belgian part of the North Sea, showed a 78 dB reduction in sound pressure level compared to an unmitigated scenario (Elzinga et al. 2019). The best efficiency is reached around the design frequency (100 Hz) of the damping elements, whilst the reduction in higher frequencies is lower to some degree. Dhne et al. (2017) have stated that this frequency response is not of benefit for highfrequency cetaceans such as Harbour Porpoise. The system would, however, work very well for fish and other cetaceans such as baleen whales that are more sensitive at lower frequencies (Southall et al. 2007 Gill et al. 2012), and a combined deployment with a bubble curtain can achieve a good overall performance in both the low and the highfrequency
