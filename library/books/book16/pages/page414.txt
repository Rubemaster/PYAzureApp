To date, more than 2,000 suctionassisted installations have been performed in oil and gas applications. However, until recently, all experience in offshore wind was limited to nearshore sites, met masts (Figure 7.10) or the anchoring of floating foundations (Ibsen et al. 2005 Zhang et al. 2012 Nielsen et al. 2017 Equinor 2017). Two principal design concepts can be discriminated (1) suction bucket jackets, with comparatively small suction buckets at the bottom of each jacket leg, and (2) the Mono Bucket, a monopile with one big suction bucket at its bottom. Suction bucket jackets have a larger footprint and shallower seabed embedment than other foundation types. This is due to the loading conditions of large offshore wind turbines and the limited pressure that can be applied in relatively shallow waters during the installation process. Significant lateral loads resulting from the wind and waves are transferred to the soil via the jacket foundation through a pushpull mechanism, predominantly resulting in vertical foundation loads (Shonberg et al. 2017). The load transferred to the ground is a function of the distance between the suction buckets such that an increase in the footprint of the jacket reduces the load on the foundations.
