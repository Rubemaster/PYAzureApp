Figure 8.4 Spatial collision risk modelling applied to the Irish Sea Round 3 Zone, UK, during the Zonal Appraisal and Planning (ZAP) process. The collision risk index was derived from mortality estimates calculated using the model and mean monthly snapshot densities of flying birds in survey cells spaced at 500 m intervals. The modelling assumed that a single generic turbine was present in each cell it used bird parameters derived from the available literature and assumed a 98 avoidance rate as a worstcase scenario. Monthly collision estimates for five sensitive species (Northern Gannet Morus bassanus, Blacklegged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, Lesser Blackbacked Gull Larus fuscus, European Herring Gull Larus argentatus and Great Blackbacked Gull Larus marinus see Figure 8.5) were summedto provide an overall annual collision estimate. An index for each cell was calculated as the percentage of the maximum number of collisions for any cell, capped at 100 per annum to facilitate interpretation of spatial trends during subsequent interpolation. The collision index is shown by proportional circles centred on each cell with an inverse distance weighted interpolated surface (1 km2 resolution) to highlight the areas of greatest risk.
