Channel mitigation, whereby the sound emitted into the water column is reduced, is achieved by applying noise reduction technologies (NRTs). Any NRT involves placing a sounddampening obstacle between the pile and the water body. The obstacle can either be air or any other soundabsorbing, reflecting or shielding material. The development of NRTs was mainly triggered by the implementation of threshold criteria for underwater noise in Germany (BMU 2013 BSH 2013b). A variety of methods and technical solutions have since been developed, tested and qualified for the offshore wind sector. An extensive overview on NRTs is provided in OSPAR (2016). The most relevant technologies to date are bubble curtains, pile casings and modular systems consisting of resonators such as hydrosound dampers (HSDs). All of these have proven their effectiveness during hundreds of pile installations (Table 7.1) and are commercially available. Detailed information for the OWF projects that are discussed in this chapter are provided in Table 7.2. Based on existing experience, NRT can be regarded as amature technology for water depths of up to 3040 m. However, deployment in deeper waters remains a challenge.;At the time of writing in 2018, bubble curtains had been the most frequently used NRT for the installation of offshore wind turbine foundations. Bubble curtains are formed by pumping compressed air through perforated hoses with nozzles. For the predominant design, the big bubble curtain (BBC), the hoses are deployed on the seabed in a radius of 5080 m around the piling site. Ascending air bubbles act as a barrier and extenuate the sound propagation by reflection, scattering and resonance effects. To boost the efficiency,
