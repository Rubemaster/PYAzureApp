OWF. In comparison to the reference condition without NRT, the noise reduction in SEL was 14 dB. The Lp,0pk was reduced by 16 dB (pile length58 m, target depth27 m, water depth27 m) (Gndert et al. 2015). The NMS6900 performed best around 1 kHz ,where the SEL was reduced by more than 30 dB (Figure 7.6). The results of the noise mitigation achieved using a BBC, a DBBC and the NMS6900 system at both Trianel Windpark Borkum (Diederichs et al. 2014) and Borkum Riffgrund 1 OWF (Schiedek et al. unpublished) are compiled in Figure 7.6.;Figure 7.6 Frequencydependent reduction in sound exposure level (SEL) for three different noisereduction technologies big bubble curtain (BBC), double big bubble curtain (DBBC) and IHC Noise Mitigation Screen (NMS6900). BBC and DBBC data were read off Figure 138 in Diederichs et al. (2014), with the NMS6900 data obtained from Schiedek et al. (unpublished). (Uwe Stber, DHI);More advanced systems designed for pile diameters up to 8.0 m (NMS8000, NMS8200) are thought to be even more efficient (H. van Vessem, personal communication 2018). The use of casings is dependent on sufficient storage and crane capacity on the installation vessel. Logistically, it may not be possible to transport very long sleeves in a vertical position, which would otherwise take
