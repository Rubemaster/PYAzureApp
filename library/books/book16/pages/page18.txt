Current knowledge is often sufficient to predict and prevent degradation of ecosystems, through careful planning, technology choice, good practice, and mitigation and restoration measures. Baseline studies and environmental monitoring programmes must be carefully planned and employ rigorous data collection if the analyses are to be capable of showing significant results for both anticipated and unforeseen effects. Since baseline studies of wind farms are performed at a fine scale, monitoring data may also serve as fundamental research on faunal distribution and behaviour, as well as playing a crucial role in the consenting and permitting processes. The continuously growing offshore wind industry requires certainty about effects before, during and after installation, to minimise or even eliminate any potential detrimental impacts on marine habitats and ecosystems. This chapter reviews monitoring methods, technologies and scientific tools that are commonly applied to monitoring fish and invertebrates at operational sites. Seabed communities are defined as the interacting assemblage of organisms in the sediment (infauna) and on sediment and structures (epifauna and algae), as well as demersal and pelagic fish. Case studies from scientifically developed monitoring programmes and studies are provided as examples of rigorous data gathering capable
