Dutch coast (after Geelhoed et al. 2018). This study was designed to investigate changes in the distance of occurrence of species such as Harbour Porpoise Phocoena phocoena according to windfarm construction and operation.;Harbour Porpoise are particularly easy to monitor acoustically as they produce stereotypical echolocation signals lasting for 1550 s, with a focused energy between 120 and 150 kHz. The interclick interval and the amplitude of the clicks gradually change, which allows these vocalisations to be easily distinguished from other highfrequency sounds that occur at sea, such as boat sonar, which is of a similar frequency, but has a very consistent interclick interval. CPOD analytical software allows a number of parameters to be extracted from the data collected (Figure 2.11). These can be used to describe the acoustic behaviour of Harbour Porpoise, such as porpoisepositive minutes (PPM). Acoustic data can also be expressed as encounters, which are defined as recordings separated by at least 10 minutes of silence. Basically, encounter duration is an expression of how long porpoise continuously click around the C POD (number of minutes between two silent periods). A closer analysis of click trains can also provide information on foraging behaviour (e.g. Nuuttila 2013 Schaffeld et al. 2016 Weel et al. 2018 Berges et al. 2019). A number of studies have deployed C PODs at windfarm sites (Carstensen et al. 2006 Scheidat et al. 2011).
