During the 200809 spring migration, a high proportion (75) of swans migrating from northwest England crossed at least one OWF footprint, compared with 7.1 tracked along the east coast from southeast England (Griffin et al. 2010). All wind farms traversed were those either consented or operational wind farms (Round 1 or Round 2) off the Cumbrian coast or in proposed Scottish territorial waters sites. No Whooper Swans were recorded flying across Round 3 wind farm footprints (Figure 4.7). The autumn 2009 and spring 2010 data indicated some variability in flight lines, with the autumnmigration being more westerly. Swans from northwest England also took a more westerly migration route in spring 2010 than in spring 2009.;Figure 4.7 Whooper Swan Cygnus cygnus migration routes in relation to offshore windfarm sites in spring 2009, showing movements to and from overwintering sites at Caerlaverock, Welney and Martin Mere.;Barnacle Geese migrated across seven prospective UK OWF sites (Figure 4.8), of which five were located in the Firth of Forth, and a further 15 proposed sites along the coast of Norway. Birds interacted most with the proposed Firth of Forth Round 3 zone (13 of 26 tracks), with tracks mainly crossing the midsouthern part of the footprint. Of spring tracks that missed the zone, 87 were also to the south, indicating that the southern part of this zone is most sensitive for the geese (Griffin et al. 2011). It is of note that the only sites yet proposed in this zone are in the north, where no migrating Barnacle Geese were observed on surveys across all seasons (Seagreen Wind Energy 2012), suggesting negligible risk of interaction.
