ANDREW J. P. HARWOOD and MARTIN R. PERROW;This chapter reviews the available options for reducing the potential effects of offshore wind farms (OWFs) upon birds through collision, displacement and indirect effects on their prey. Possible options to mitigate bat collision are also reviewed. There are only a few examples of mitigation, and therefore untested theoretical options and approaches used onshore that could translate to the offshore environment are included. As a first step, careful marine spatial planning to locate wind farms in less sensitive areas may avoid some potential impacts. Otherwise, measures to minimise, reduce or compensate for impacts will be required. Modifications to OWF configurations and turbine design, combined with sensitive construction methods, provide clear means of minimising impacts. Where a residual risk of collision remains, this may be reduced by making turbines more visible by painting blades before installation, and deterring birds from approaching turbines, including the use of green lighting for nocturnal migrants. Curtailing turbine operation for migratory species, altering cutin speeds for bats and providing alternative perches for seabirds, which might otherwise use OWF structures, all show promise to mitigate collision losses. However, the options to reduce displacement of sensitive species such as divers (loons) Gavia spp. are limited. Where impacts cannot be reduced to acceptable levels, compensatory measures should be
