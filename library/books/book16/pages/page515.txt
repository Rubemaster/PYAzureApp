MSP in the USA aims at encouraging shared responsibilities and interagency cooperation among federal and stateauthorities during the planning and approval processes. While some states predefine sites for OWF development, which allow developers to propose OWF projects such as the Renewable Energy Zone in Rhode Island or four renewable energy suitability study areas in Oregon, other states identify OWF potentials and propose further studies at the consecutive planning tiers.;In Canada, the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA) encompasses around twothirds of the British Columbian coast. In a collaborative process, an integrated management plan for the PNCIMA was developed and published in 20072012. The process was led through an oceans governance agreement between the federal, provincial and First Nations governments, with contributions by various organisations, stakeholders and interested parties (PNCIMA Initiative 2017). Among other marine renewable approaches, the plan identifies wind energy to be of future interest in the plan area, with 79 windpower tenures onshore and offshore already in place by 2010 and an additional 81 undergoing the application process (PNCIMA Initiative 2011).;In 2009, a comprehensive marine planning system was established in the UK, backed by the Marine and Coastal Access Act of 2009 (Parliament of the United Kingdom 2009). A Marine Policy Statement provided the context for marine plans and aimed at greater coherence in legislation throughout the UK (HM Government 2011). In 2018, the UK Government published a 25 year Environment Plan, which commits to having UK Marine Plans in place by 2021 (HM Government 2018). Among the different countries, 11 marine plan areas have been designated for the coastal (inshore) and EEZ (offshore) zones in England (MMO 2014), with the devolved administrations in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland issuing their own marine plans, including Scotlands National Marine Plan (Scottish Government 2015) and the Welsh National Marine Plan (Welsh Government 2018).
