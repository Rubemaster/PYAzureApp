Figure 7.1 A sound map showing the sound propagation from a hypothetical impact piledriving event in the Baltic Sea. The solid blue, black and green lines indicate impact ranges for behavioural response, temporary threshold shift and permanent threshold shift, respectively, for Harbour Seals when using a bubble curtain as mitigation. Such maps are usually used in sound impact assessments in conjunction with data on the distribution and abundance of marine animals.
