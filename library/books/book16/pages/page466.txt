Figure 8.7 Navigation buoys or other structures may be used as perches by a range of species, but particularly gulls and terns (all white dots in this picture above the sea and on the buoy are Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis), which may discourage birds from using the turbine bases within the wind farm, where they may be at risk of collision. Alternatively, such structures may attract birds to the vicinity of the wind farm and decoy perches may be best installed some distance away. (Martin Perrow);The tendency to perch on windfarm structures may be exploited by the use of towers, or other structures, placed around the perimeter of a wind farm to lure birds away from the immediate windfarm footprint (Curry  Kerlinger 2000 Larsen  Guillemette 2007). The efficacy of these decoys may be enhanced by the use of antiperching devices on structures in the wind farm itself. For example, antiperching measures for the meteorological tower in the now abandoned Cape Wind Farm project, off Massachusetts (USA), were suggested as part of the mitigation plan to prevent raptors using the area to intercept transiting terns (ESS Group Inc. 2012).
