The results illustrate the considerable variability in potential risk from simple changes in turbine parameters (Figure 8.6). For example, for Lesser Blackbacked Gull, generally the most sensitive species as a result of its tendency towards higher flight height and nocturnal activity (Table 8.1), increasing hub height from 60 to 100 m (given a blade length of 50 m) resulted in a 92 reduction in collision estimates. Conversely, increasing the rotor radius from 50 m to 80 m (maintaining a hub height of 100 m) resulted in a 702 increase in potential collisions. Thus, a single larger turbine with longer rotors will have a greater effect than a smaller one, unless this is naturally offset by increased hub height and an increasing air gap.
