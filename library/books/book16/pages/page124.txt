A number of projects began during the 1970s to attempt to map the offshore distributions of seabirds, such as those by Gould (1974) in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Briggs et al. (1978) in the Southern California Bight, Brown et al. (1975) in the western Atlantic Ocean and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (1977) in the eastern Atlantic. In the UK, the original drive to begin seabird surveys at sea came from the need for informed advice for the offshore oil and gas industry. The survey methods used for these projects advanced the standardisation of seabird abundance from the rudimentary number of birds per hour to number of birds per square kilometre as density. The advent of the Seabirds at Sea programme of the Nature Conservancy Council in 1979 in the North Sea resulted in a review of the potential survey methods for census of seabirds from ships and recommended a standardised approach to improve comparability between different and overlappingprojects (Tasker et al. 1984). Most of these programmes used ships of opportunity, such as research ships engaged in other scientific pursuits. While these were an economical way to gather data, they often resulted in gaps in potentially critical sea areas. Many investigators resorted to the expense of dedicated ship charter to fill gaps, but others started to use faster moving and thus potentially cheaper aircraft for this purpose, employing striptransect methods (e.g. Briggs et al. 1978 Gould et al. 1978).;The plea of Tasker et al. (1984) for standardisation of methods was mostly successful in northern European waters, with projects in the continental shelf waters of the Netherlands (Camphuysen  Leopold 1994), Germany (e.g. Garthe et al. 1995 Diederichs et al. 2002), Denmark (Skov, unpublished report 1992), Belgium (Offringa et al. 1995) and Norway (Barrett et al.2004) all adopting the basic foundations of the Tasker et al. (1984) method, comprising observations divided into 10 minute recording intervals, a 300 m wide strip transect and a snapshot method for flying birds. Webb  Durinck (1992) described an addition to this standard in the form of a subdivision of the strip transect for birds sitting on the water to enable detection efficiency to be calculated. This provided compatibility with linetransect methods (Buckland et al. 2001), which some early investigators considered to be too cumbersome for use at sea (Wiens et al. 1978).;One of the outcomes of the standardisation of survey techniques was the formation of the European Seabirds at Sea Database Co ordinating Group (ESAS) in 1991 (Reid  Camphuysen 1998), which focused initially on combining compatible data from different research groups in the North Sea, but has since expanded to much of the northeast Atlantic waters. The database has spawned many analyses, such as those by Camphuysen and Leopold (1994), Stone et al. (1995) and Skov et al. (2007). The database was not restricted to boatbased data, but also hosted visual aerial survey data, again collected using standardised methods. Initially, these standards, defined in Komdeur et al. (1992), were for strip transects, but owing to evidence that observers could not detect birds in the outer regions of these strips, surveyors adopted line transect methods with distance estimation (Kahlert et al. 2000).
