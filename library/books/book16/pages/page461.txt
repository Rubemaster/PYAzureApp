Figure 8.6 Collision risk estimates (collisions per annum) with no avoidance for Northern Gannet Morus bassanus, Lesser Blackbacked Gull Larus fuscus and Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis using Band model option 2 (Band 2012) according to variation in (a) hub height from 60 to 100 m and (b) rotor radius 5080 m in isolation, while maintaining the constancy of other turbine parameters.;Similar results were noted for Northern Gannet and Sandwich Tern, despite variations in the magnitude of estimates associated with their flight attributes and height distributions. Thus, adjusting hub height so that the blades do not sweep the altitudes most frequented by the species of concern and minimising the rotor radius can help to reduce collision risk. However, the use of smaller turbines, leading to a requirement for more turbines to deliver a particular site capacity, presents a greater risk.;In addition, a simple comparison between collision risk estimates for the three species discussed (parameters from Table 8.1) based on 833.6 MW machines (rotor radius of 65 m) or 388 MW machines (rotor radius of 90 m) to provide 300 MW of capacity was also undertaken. This assumed a constant air gap of 20 m, constant operational time of 95 and constant pitch of 10. However, the maximum blade width (4.2 m for a 3.6 MW machine and 5.4 m for an 8 MW machine) and nominal rotor speeds (12.5 ms for a 3.6 MW machine and 10.5 ms for an 8 MW machine) were selected based on indicative turbine model information. Under these scenarios, and given an avoidance rate of 99, the model Option 2 results suggested 106 Northern Gannet could collide with the 3.6 MW turbine wind farm while 59 birds could collide under the 8 MW turbine scenario, a reduction of around 44. Similar reductions were seen for Sandwich Terns (31 collisions reducing to 18) and Lesser Blackbacked Gulls (243 collisions reducing to 137).
