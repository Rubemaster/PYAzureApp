where Rmax is the maximum intrinsic growth rate of a population, Nmin is a conservative estimate of population size, and f is arecovery factor between 0.1 and 1 (Wade 1998). As Rmax can be difficult to estimate, Niel and Lebreton (2005) suggested supplementing it with an estimate of the maximum annual population growth rate, max, as follows;Using the principles of lifehistory theory (Charnov 1993), Niel  Lebreton (2005) estimated the maximum annual population growth rate using its predictable relationship with age at first breeding and annual adult survival probabilitywhere s is annual adult survival probability and  is age at first breeding. These equations enable estimation of PBR using only estimates of minimum population size (Nmin), adult survival (s) and age at first breeding (). The limited data requirements and relative simplicity of the formulae make this an attractive tool with which to assess the populationlevel consequences of collisions with OWFs.;Developers seeking to make the case for the Triton Knoll OWF and Phase II of the London Array OWF were amongst the first to make use of PBR in relation to windfarm EIA (Box 5.2). Subsequently, the approach was widely adopted in the assessments of other UK wind farms, including Beatrice, Hornsea and the Forth and Tay Developments (Cook et al. 2015). PBR has also been suggested as a tool for the assessment of OWF effects on birds elsewhere in Europe (Busch  Garthe 2016 2017). However, significant criticisms of this approach have emerged (Green et al. 2016 OBrien et al. 2017).
