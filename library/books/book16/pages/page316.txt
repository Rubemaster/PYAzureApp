This chapter introduces the main methods used to monitor collisions and avoidanceattraction behaviour of birds and bats at operational offshore wind turbines. The methods considered here encompass visual daytime and nighttime observation, thermal imaging, radar, acoustic recording and telemetry. Some of these are included in this chapter for completeness, but are explained in more detail in other chapters of this volume, such as Thaxter  Perrow (Chapter 4) in the case of telemetry and tracking and Cook  Masden (Chapter 5) in relation to modelling of collision risk. The methods outlined are assessed and compared with each other in terms of their feasibility to operate effectively under offshore conditions. The intention is to provide an overview on the strengths and limitations of the various methods and technologies used for monitoring birds and bats at operational sites. As the focus of offshore wind energy has been in European waters, most examples originate from northwestern Europe, although developmentrelated studies from the USA are also included. The information collated in this chapter has been extracted from scientific articles published in peerreviewed journals, publicly available reports, conference presentations and websites. The chapter concludes with what the authors consider to be the best practical approach to monitor the interactions of seabirds, migratory terrestrial landbirds and bats with operational wind farms in a range of diverse environmental conditions offshore.
