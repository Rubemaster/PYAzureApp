Figure 6.9 Thermal image of a European Herring Gull Larus argentatus approaching the spinning rotor of a wind turbine, but avoiding collision by flying along the plane of the rotor (recorded on the test site in Denmark).

DAPS Data Acquisition and Preprocessing System FPGA field programmable gate array. (Inset photograph Thomas W. Johansen);The classification of bird objects by the radar is facilitated by the high temporal resolution of the signal acquisition, which makes it possible to filter radar echoes against the known signature of a bird signal when in flight. Once the camera receives the position of the flying bird from the radar, it will zoom on the bird while recording the event on video. In this project, the system was applied with a standard marine radar (magnetron Xband) and a combined visualthermal camera, but it is capable of running with both solidstate and magnetronbased radars, as well as with a range of digital pan tilt cameras with visual and thermal channels. The number of turbines (rotors) that can be monitored will depend on the target species and the distance between turbines. As a rule of thumb, the radar can detect a standard seabird at 4 km range, and a digital camera with highresolution motion control can follow a seabird at approximately 1 km distance.
