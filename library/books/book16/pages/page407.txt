Atlantic Herring Clupea harengusrelated temporalspatial consenting restrictions or other mitigation requirements associated with marine licences. Piling restrictions are applied in these cases because of the potential effect of piling upon spawning adult herring andor their behaviour (MMO 2014 Boyle  New 2018). Perrow et al. (2011) suggest that the negative impact of pile driving upon recruitment of Atlantic Herring at one site, with indirect effects on a protected breeding seabird, could have readily been avoided with a short temporal restriction on piling activity to avoid their main spawning period. In the USA, several windfarm developers have signed an agreement to phase out impact pile driving at planned projects sites on the East Coast during critical times (e.g. during the spring migration) for North Atlantic Right Whales Eubalaena glacialis (Deepwater Wind 2014).;The principal issue with any temporal restriction is that the cost of such measures could be relatively high if this would lead to a delay in windfarm construction for example, when construction activities are moved to a period with adverse weather that prevents a continuous installation process. This is especially true when NRTs are available to mitigate sound to a level that leads to non significant impacts (see Dhne et al. 2017 for a case study).;The alternatives to impact piledriving are generally less noisy and thus can be considered lownoise foundation installation technologies. These have only been used occasionally, although efforts are being made to increase the market share of these alternatives, not only for environmental, but also for economic reasons. Here, information is presented on three methods vibratory piling, drilling and the suction bucket concept.
