In general, planning addresses humandriven interactions atnumerous levels, on different scales and for many purposes, including natural resource use and management (Portman 2016). Since natural resources are unequally distributed in space and time, planners and managers who understand how to work with the relevant temporal and spatial diversity are needed. MSP comes in various shapes and scales, yet it is comprised of a number of generic characteristics of spatial planning (Ehler et al. 2007 Jay 2010a 2010b), including (1) future orientation and (2) making use of strategies that seek to achieve agreed goals and that it is (3) primarily a publicsector activity with different governance tiers, both (4) shaping and protecting the natural environment, (5) embodied in statutory procedures, and (6) concerned with the formation of entire patterns of activities across large territories.;Since the turn of the twentyfirst century, what were initially informal, but have become yet more and more regulated spatial planning approaches have been developed all around the world. The development of renewable energies at sea added a new dimensions and urgency to managing ocean spaces (Jay 2010a Boucquey et al. 2016). By 2018, around 70 countries had introduced MSP approaches, ranging from preparatory stages to planning revisions and adaptation (UNESCO 2018), in keeping with the fact that MSP evolved in parallel with the emergence of offshore renewable energy (Ehler et al. 2007 Johnson et al. 2012 Bradshaw et al. 2018 Ehler 2018 Yates et al. 2018). In a nutshell, MSP addresses the sustainable development of marine areas in that it shall consider economic, social and environmental aspects to support  growth in the maritime sector, applying an ecosystem based approach, and to promote the coexistence of relevant activities and uses, as paraphrased in the EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive 201489EC (European Parliament amp European Council 2014, Art. 5) (Box 9.1). A standard approach in spatial planning applies zoning schemes to allow for the coexistence of different planned activities, including conservation (Stelzenmller et al. 2013). A comprehensive overview on the emergence and current importance of MSP can be found in the introduction to Environmental Planning for Oceans and Coasts (Portman 2016 97113).
