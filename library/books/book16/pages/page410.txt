To close existing knowledge gaps regarding the bearing capacity of vibrodriven piles, a pilot project led by RWE and supported by the Carbon Trusts OWA initiative was conducted at an onshore test site at Cuxhaven in northern Germany in 2014. The objective was to demonstrate that for sandy soils, the lateral load capacity ofvibrated piles is equivalent to that of hammered piles. Three 4.3 m diameter test piles (length 21.5 m, wall thickness 4045 mm) were installed with a hydraulic PVE 500M vibrodriving unit and another three with a hydraulic impact hammer to an embedment depth of 18.5 m (Carbon Trust 2015b Dieseko Group 2016). This field experiment provided additional evidence that vibratory piling is considerably faster and less intense compared to impact pile driving. Three years after installation, a followup study assessed the soil setup effect that had developed over time. The results suggest that, under consideration of several installation aspects, the bearing capacity of the installed vibrated and hammered piles is comparable to a large extent (Innogy 2017).;Calculations based on field measurements indicate a 1520 dB lower noise level for vibropiling compared to undamped impact piledriving (Elmer et al. 2007a Betke  Matuschek 2011). However, on refusal or in harder substrate, noise levels may be higher (J. Kringelum, personal communication 2014). In addition, one must be cautious when comparing sound signals of different metrics (se also Box 7.1). During vibropiling, the emitted frequency spectrum comprises peaks occurring at the vibration frequency (usually 2040 Hz) and its harmonics. At frequencies above 500 Hz, the spectrum is more even in nature and can extend to several kilohertz (Spence et al. 2007).;Several windfarm projects have provided field experience with the sound emissions of vibratory piling. However, vibropiling was not used to drive the piles to target depth in any of these cases. At the German pilot wind farm Alpha Ventus for example, 18 pin piles for six tripod foundations were vibrated 9 m down into the sandy seabed before hydraulic impact piling commenced. The measured SPL (averaged over 5 seconds, at 750 m) in vibratory piling was 142157 dB re 1 Pa while the measured SEL (singlestrike, at 750 m) in impact piling was 171175 dB re 1 Pa2 s (Betke  Matuschek 2011 Koschinski  Ldemann 2013). SPLs in the 100 Hz to 1 kHz frequency range were significantly reduced for the vibratory hammer compared to the impact piledriver (Betke  Matuschek 2011). At Riffgat OWF, the CAPE Holland Super Quad Kong, a combination of four inphase vibrodrivers, was used to install 30 large monopiles 1530 m deep into the seabed. After that,
