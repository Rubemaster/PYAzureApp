Figure 8.3 The operational Race Bank site in the Greater Wash, UK (seeleft inset) incorporates the exclusion of two ternsensitive areas from the original proposed site (black polygon) that exhibited the highest use (black circles in right inset) by Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis recorded during boatbased surveys. Tracking from the colonies confirmed that birds breeding at two colonies within the North Norfolk Coast Special Protection Area could readily reach the site on longer foraging trips and thus all birds present at the site in the breeding season were assumed to originate from these important colonies. The exclusion of ternsensitive areas considerably reduced predicted collision risk. Bathymetry data from EMODnet Bathymetry Consortium 2018 EMODnet Digital Bathymetry (DTM);Figure 8.4 Spatial collision risk modelling applied to the Irish Sea Round 3 Zone, UK, during the Zonal Appraisal and Planning (ZAP) process. The collision risk index was derived from mortality estimates calculated using the model and mean monthly snapshot densities of flying birds in survey cells spaced at 500 m intervals. The modelling assumed that a single generic turbine was present in each cell it used bird parameters derived from the available literature and assumed a 98 avoidance rate as a worstcase scenario. Monthly collision estimates for five sensitive species (Northern Gannet Morus bassanus, Blacklegged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, Lesser Blackbacked Gull Larus fuscus, European Herring Gull Larus argentatus and Great Blackbacked Gull Larus marinus see Figure 8.5) were summed
