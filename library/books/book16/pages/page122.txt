Seabird surveys have a long history and have been adapted for use in relation to wind farms. At first, boatbased and aerial observer surveys were used, but digital aerial survey techniques have been developed that offer enhancements in terms of speed of survey and, in some cases, cost, accuracy and safety. With specific standalone examples presented in boxes, this chapter describes how these traditional and new methods may be used to provide abundance estimates for characterisation and impact assessment, and to monitor windfarm effects and impacts as accurately and precisely as possible. Notwithstanding that it is important to tailor the methods to the specific circumstances and the questions being asked, this chapter concludes with a series of guiding principles on how to conduct surveys and how data should be analysed, as follows (1) the size of the survey area must extend beyond the distance at which seabirds may respond to the wind farm, (2) aerial surveys are best suited to large study areas and species sensitive to vessels, (3) boatbased surveys are best suited to provide detailed information on seabird behaviour and flight height, (4) the proportion of transect area should sample at least 10 of the study area, (5) surveys should be carried out once or twice per month as an absolute minimum and generally be maintained throughout the annual cycle, (6) more than 2 years of surveys will be required to describe interannual variation, (7) where more than one site is present, projects should combine monitoring efforts over a large scale to understand cumulative effects, (8) power analysis should be
