Growing concerns over the effects of climate change, tied with a growing recognition of the vast potential of using offshore wind power and its immediate proximity to major human population centres around the globe, have created worldwide markets and increasing demand for this clean and renewable energy source. Following the lead of countries such as the UK, with just under 36 of installed capacity in 2016, and Germany with 29, new offshore projects in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA are quickly coming on line (GWEC 2016 Bundesverband WindEndergie 2018 Jameson et al. 2019). Offshore wind energy could conceivably contribute to population declines in birds and bats as a result of the industrys spatial scale and potential for expansion (Hppop et al. 2019), as shown or suspected for some vulnerable species groups onshore (Perrow 2017). For migratory landbirds and all bats, crossing the open sea poses a higher risk than flying over land simply because of the almost total lack of landing opportunities at sea. Anecdotal reports (e.g. Aumller et al. 2011) and longterm data on bird activity around illuminated, anthropogenic offshore structures (Hppop et al. 2016) also illustrate the potential attraction and collision risk for migratory birds in particular, but also resident seabirds (reviewed in Ballasus et al. 2009 Orr et al. 2013 Ronconi et al. 2015). About onethird ofthe latter, as well as many migratory bird species, are considered globally threatened or even critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Croxall et al. 2012 Vickery et al. 2014 Bairlein 2016). Conservation of bird and bat populations is also considered mandatory for a number of reasons (1) as an ethical obligation, (2) for the maintenance of ecological function, as a result of the pivotal role that bats and birds play in, for instance, nutrient cycling, preservation of ecosystem health, and the diversity and dispersal of organisms (e.g. Kunz et al. 2011 Whelan et al. 2015), and (3) for significant socioeconomic benefits (Kunz et al. 2011) for example, the foraging activity of pestcontrolling insectivorous species is worth 3.7 billion USD each year in North America (Boyles et al. 2011).;Populationlevel effects of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on bat and bird species may result inter alia from (1) collisioninduced mortality (Kunz et al. 2007 Ahln et al. 2009 Masden et al. 2010 Furness et al. 2013 Masden  Cook 2016 Horswill et al. 2017), (2) distortion of flight routes causing detours around wind farms that can impose energetic debts (Masden et al. 2010), and (3) fragmentation or loss of seabird foraging grounds (Garthe et al. 2017), but possibly also (4) from the creation of new foraging and roosting opportunities (Ronconi et al. 2015). Of these, collision effects have attracted considerable empirical, but also theoretical research interest. Empirical evidence on bird mortality at offshore structures, such as platforms and rigs, corroborates the notion that the probability of bird collisions increases with sudden changes to adverse weather when birds are already en route across the open sea (e.g. Aumller et al. 2011 reviewed in Schuster et al. 2015). Under these conditions, nocturnally migrating songbirds comprise the majority of collision victims, as shown in Figure 6.1 and documented in numerous studies conducted on platforms (e.g. Hansen 1954 Aumller et al. 2011 Schulz et al. 2011 Hppop et al. 2016 2019). For offshore wind turbines, however, such information is still missing. Theoretical research includes the development of models to predict collision risk of birds and bats with wind turbines (reviewed in Masden  Cook 2016 Peterson 2016 Cook  Masden, Chapter 5). However, the quality of bird count and flight height data is
