Figure 7.8 Deployment of a hydrosound damper (HSD) prototype at London Array wind farm in the Thames estuary, UK. The HSD system is folded in the frame that is lifted above the monopile. (KarlHeinz Elmer, OffNoiseSolutions GmbH);In 20132014, an improved HSD system was deployed during the installation of 47 (out of 80) monopiles at the Amrumbank West OWF. With an average noise reduction of 813 dB (SEL) (Bellmann 2014) and a 20 dB noise reduction in the frequency range between 100 and 800 Hz (Bruns et al. 2014), the HSD system showed a good constant performance (Figure 7.9). However, the handling of the commercial prototype required two crane operations, which caused delays of 34 hours per pile during the installation process (S. Schorcht, personal communication 2014). Therefore, all following projects have used improved HSD systems where a winch frame with an HSD box that may be easily lowered is already positioned below the pile gripper. Several projects, including Sandbank and Veja Mate OWFs, both located in the German Bight, have used such an advanced system.
