Micrositing turbines to increase or decrease the permeability of an array could aid in reducing displacement and barrier effects or collision risk. Furthermore, the use of fewer, larger and more productive turbines with the greatest possible air gap offers the potential to significantly reduce collision risk for seabirds, while maintaining site capacity, although the risk to migrating birds, at higher altitudes, could be increased. Such sitelevel planning must be balanced against the engineering and cost constraints for a productive and viable project.;Once the site has been constructed, adopting green, rather than red, lighting could reduce attraction to and therefore collision of migrating birds, although further research is needed on the effects of different lighting approaches on different species to make sure that there are no confounding impacts. Decoy structures could also be employed to lure sensitive species away from turbines, although again further research and trials are required to support their use. While auditory and visual bird deterrents could be effective for reducing densities of birds subject to risk, they are likely to be speciesspecific, birds could habituate, and some deterrents may be effective only in certain weather conditions.;Temporary turbine shutdown, as used at several terrestrial wind farms, also shows promise in being readily applicable at OWFs and could be highly effective for reducing collision mortalities for some species under certain scenarios, such as in poor weather during key migration periods at migration bottlenecks bringing large numbers of passerines into the range of turbines. Temporary shutdown and particularly increasing cutin speed, as applied onshore, seem likely to be the most effective methods to reduce bat collisions at OWFs.;Of all the measures to reduce collision of birds, painting turbine blades with different patterns so that they be more easily perceived and thus avoided is perhaps the most attractive option with general applicability. Given the ease and low cost with which this could be implemented and the potential level of benefit that could accrue, there is an argument that painting turbines should be undertaken as a matter of course at all sites (many sites such at Alpha Ventus and other sites in German waters already appear to have done so) even if monitoring does not appear to have been undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the measure.
