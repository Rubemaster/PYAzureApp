Figure 6.12 Sketch of the calculation of empirical mesoavoidance (top) and microavoidance (bottom) in the ORJIP Bird Collision Avoidance study. For mesoavoidance, the right panel describes observed track length density, while the left panel describes the hypothetical scenario with the same total track length as observed, but without the wind turbines. For microavoidance (bottom), arrows represent bird movement in relation to the rotor, shown as a dark blue ellipse, with the addition of a 10 m buffer, shown as a red ellipse. The light blue arrow represents wind direction. Seabirds have been observed to adjust their flight to avoid individual blades (dotted arrow), or not to adjust, but cross the rotor and survive (solid arrow), or, on
