(Vanermen  Stienen 2019). In this approach, any differences between the pre and postconstruction period according to the effect of the wind farm are assumed to be a function of distance from the wind farm and that effects would be roughly the same in all directions (Vanermen  Stienen 2019). A significant beforeafter change (that may be positive as a result of attraction and negative as a result of displacement) that declines with distance from the wind farm provides compelling evidence that the wind farm is the cause of any change.;Lincs Wind Farm is a 270 MW wind farm comprising 75 turbines situated approximately 8 km offshore due east of the coast of Lincolnshire, England. The development was constructed between March 2011 and March 2013 and is adjacent to the much smaller Lynn  Inner Dowsing (LID) wind farms, each with 27 wind turbines constructed between October 2006 and October 2008. Boatbased and visual aerial survey data, as well as radar studies, were used to inform the ornithological sections of the Environmental Impact Assessment of Lincs. However, because of restricted access to the airspace around the adjacent LID wind farms raising concerns over safety, higher flying (550 m) digital video aerial surveys were introduced and ultimately replaced visual aerial surveys for postconsent monitoring at Lincs in combination with LID.
