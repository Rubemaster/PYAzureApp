Figure 9.5 First Marine Spatial Plan map for the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the North Sea (BSH 2009b).;The assessment of both cumulative and incombination effects constitutes a major task in conducting SEAs on MSP plans and involves the identification of impacts from multiple uses those subject to the plan and those interacting with it. The consideration of cumulative effects proves most effective at higher planning levels, where developments might still avoid and mitigate unintended effects substantially. However, some aspects tend to be tiered to the licensing phase anyway, for example, the in combination effects of pile driving and underwater noise, which remain uncertain until the exact piling position and construction period have been determined. For biota, the analysis may focus on the significance of affecting the most sensitive species and habitats. The leads to the challenging questions of acceptable levels of impact and the carrying capacity of ecosystems in terms of cumulative OWF development in combination with other anthropogenic stressors. In general, an absence of a common understanding about the nature of cumulative (and incombination) effects prevails (Willsteed et al. 2018), causing a bottleneck for
