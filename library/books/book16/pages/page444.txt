In the terrestrial environment, the risk of wind farms to bats from collision or barotrauma during migration, investigation or foraging is well documented (Arnett et al. 2008 Baerwald  Barclay 2009 Brinkmann et al. 2011 Kunz et al. 2007 Cryan et al. 2014 Jameson  Willis 2014 Rydell et al. 2010 Voigt et al. 2015). Observations in the Baltic Sea and North Sea have provided evidence that bats also approach and forage within wind farms (Ahln et al. 2007 2009 Lagerveld et al. 2014), other offshore installations (Seebens et al. 2013 Hppop  Hill 2016 Bach et al. 2017) and vessels (Sonntag et al. 2006 Walter et al. 2007). Bats have also been found foraging at sea, up to 2.2 km from the German Baltic coast in June (Seebens et al. 2013), although the importance of atsea prey resources such as moths and other insects to bats remains unknown. It is also unclear to what extent insects are attracted to wind farms as a result of the colour of the structures (Long et al. 2011), or lighting, given that they may be the only refuge for many miles at sea. There is also the potential for bats to roost in windfarmstructures, particularly in relation to the larger substations (Ahln et al. 2009). Pelletier et al. (2013) conducted a synthesis of information on the potential for bat interaction with offshore wind farms (OWFs) and concluded that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that many species migrate offshore and use islands, ships and other offshore structures as opportunistic or deliberate stopover sites, but that little is still known about the seasonality and extent of the migrations and how behaviour such as foraging patterns may differ offshore. They also found that migratory species were equally likely to be recorded at offshore, coastal or inland sites, while nonmigratory species were less likely to be recorded at offshore sites relative to coastal and inland sites.;A review of the characteristics of offshore migration in bats by Hppop et al. (2019) outlines that activity may be focused on a specific flight for particular species, and although a range of species may be encountered, some, such as Eastern Red Bat Lasiurus borealis in the USA (Figure 8.1) and Nathusius Pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii in Europe, are especially prevalent. In relation to the former, Hatch et al. (2013) recorded a total of 12 Eastern Red Bats 16.941.9 km from shore during aerial digital and boatbased surveys mainly targeted at birds (see Webb  Nehls, Chapter 3) on the Atlantic seaboard of the USA. All six of the bats for which flight height could be confidently calculated were recorded at 100 m, with five of these six at 200 m from the sea surface.
