Figure 2.7 The IndoPacific Humpback Dolphin Sousa chinensis, known locally as the Chinese White Dolphin, in the vicinity of wind farms in the South China Sea. (Lindsay J. Porter, University of St Andrews);Both static passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) devices and boatbased (shipboard) PAM devices were deployed at various distances from the piling activity. Two piling events were monitored (1) of 14 hours duration with 4,757 strikes at various powers, and a total of 1.9 hours total piling and (2) of 5 hours duration with 3,778 strikes and 1.4 hours total piling, again at various hammer powers. Using several independent means of calculation and direct spectral plotting, both sound exposure level (SEL) and peak sound pressure level (SPLpk) were determined at various distances from the piling source. Few studies have examined the auditory physiology of Sousa spp. however, several acoustic characterisations and audiograms have been obtained from freeranging and stranded humpback dolphins outside Taiwan (Li et al. 2012 Wang et al. 2015). The recordings and observations available indicate that Sousa have a typical odontocete hearing range of 20 kHz to 100 kHz, with echolocation signals with peak energy above 100 kHz, but with significant energy down to 20 kHz. This is consistent with the classification of the species as a mid frequency cetacean for the purposes of assessing the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammal hearing (Finneran
