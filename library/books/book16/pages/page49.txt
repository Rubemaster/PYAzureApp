To investigate the effects of the construction phase on Atlantic Cod, we tagged 14 and 27 individuals (Figure 1.8) in 2016 and 2017, respectively, at Belwind, an operational (construction was completed in 2010) wind farm in the Belgian part of the North Sea, while construction activities at the surrounding wind farms of Nobelwind and Rentel were still ongoing (Figure 1.9). A network of acoustic receivers was set up around the base of a turbine within Belwind (2017 setup shown in Figure 1.10), with Atlantic Cod tagged with acoustic tags at that same turbine. This made it possible to track the individual fish that inhabited the turbine before, during and after construction activities. The first 14 fish were tagged with acoustic Vemco tags without sensors that provide information on presence and position, whereas the second batch of 27 individuals were tagged with Vemco tags containing both pressure and accelerometer sensors. These sensors provide information on depth usage as well as activity levels of the individual fish, resulting in an even more detailed picture of the horizontal and vertical movement and behaviour. Furthermore, we performed indoor experiments during which a correlation was made between acceleration and oxygen consumption, which provides information on the energetic costs of observed activity levels.;Figure 1.8 Example of the size of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua captured for tagging studies.
