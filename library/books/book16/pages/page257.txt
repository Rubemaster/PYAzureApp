AONGHAIS S. C. P. COOK and ELIZABETH A. MASDEN;Collision risk is seen as a key consenting risk in relation to offshore wind farms. As part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process, the potential collision risk to seabird populations must be estimated both at the level of the individual project and at a cumulative level across all projects. Having assessed collision risk in terms of the total number of birds likely to be affected, these numbers must then be put in the context of the populations concerned. Models are central to this process, from the collision risk models used to assess risk to the population models used to assess the consequences of an impact at a colony level. In this chapter, the process by which collision risk is assessed using a collision risk model is described, the results of which are then used in conjunction with a population model to assess the likely population level consequences of any collisions. As with any models, both the collision risk models and the population models are simplifications of reality and, as a result, often subject to significant uncertainty. The types of model available to practitioners are outlined and the limitations associated with them are discussed. As the number of operational wind farms increases, assessing the cumulative effect of multiple projects becomes a more pressing concern. However, this
