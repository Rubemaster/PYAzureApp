Figure 4.8 Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis migration movements across the Firth of Forth and interactions with proposed offshore wind farm areas example tracks and direction of travel are shown for nine birds, including spring and autumn migration route distinctions for birds with more than one migration period studied.;Considering terrestrial wind farms, 80 of the Whooper Swans in 2009 and 2010 crossed at least one proposed or operational site. For individuals tracked from Martin Mere and Welney, 39 and 22, respectively, crossed at least three windfarm sitesfootprints (offshoreonshore) during a single migration. Nearly all 21 Svalbard Barnacle Geese from the Solway Firth to Svalbard passed within 2 km of at least one proposedoperational wind farm (onshore and offshore). Four geese (19) crossed wind farms on at least six occasions during a return migration. An estimated 50 and 60 of birds crossed wind farms (existing or planned) in the UK and Norway, respectively. These data all illustrate the need to consider both terrestrial and OWFs in an international context when considering cumulative effects.
