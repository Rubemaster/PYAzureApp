Protected Area (MPA) designation. Thus, the Antarctic and Arctic seas are perhaps the most relevant and emerging hotspots for MSP in the future, the latter of which is already facing pressure from fossil energy drilling exploration as well as novel fishery and shipping options under climate change conditions (Edwards amp Evans 2017). Since the first MSP approaches, marine sanctuaries and MPAs have also increased dynamically (UNEPWCM amp IUCN 2018). In 2017, MPAs covered around 16 of national waters, which in turn represent around 39 of the global ocean. Thus, in total around 7 of the oceans are covered by 15,604 MPAs (UNEPWCM amp IUCN 2018). Moreover, when MSP first evolved, data were scarce and monitoring was scant. Geospatial databases have since become vital in collecting information on a variety of essential parameters, such as the distribution of species and a range of different uses of the sea, thereby assisting more informed decision making in the future (Boucquey et al. 2016).;At the same time, OWF development was set up rather dynamically in the early 2000s, with the first turbines installed in nearshore locations along the Dutch and Danish coasts (EWEA 2011). The first utilityscale OWF, the Middelgrunden project, with 20 turbines and a total capacity of 40 MW, was installed in 2001 in Danish waters (Vlund amp Hansen 2001). Ever since, the consent and development of OWFs has continued apace, with future objectives of installing turbines at increasingly greater distances out at sea (Simas 2017). By the end of 2017, there was 18.8 GW of installed capacity in 17 markets around the world, with 84 (15.7 GW) installed in European waters, mainly in the North and Baltic Seas (GWEC 2018). Moreover, the number of countries with pilot phases or industrialscale OWF development projects is growing and, hence, offshore wind is taking shape as a mainstream energy source (GWEC 2018 54).;Initially, MSP could not effectively follow up or even set an appropriate agenda on where to site (or exclude) OWFs. For example, the German offshore wind energy strategy was launched in 2002 while OWF project planning and permitting procedures started immediately. The first MSP plan was approved 7 years later, in 2009. Although including its own inherent Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), the first German MSP process
