Other than siting and timing, discussed above, the material, type and design of the foundations are important features that can be optimised in an environmental sense based on general and local circumstances. For instance, there is a range offoundation types that minimise the use of heavy piling. In areas sensitive to piling noise, consideration should be given to avoiding the use of monopile foundations (heavy piling) and instead relying on gravity foundations, drilled foundations or foundations based on smalldiameter piles (Hammar et al. 2008), although these are more expensive.;Compared to steel foundations, concretebased gravity foundations trigger fouling organisms to settle at a significantly higher rate (Degraer 2012) and also emit less turbine vibration during operation (Hammar et al. 2008). However, concrete foundations have the disadvantage of being significantly more expensive than steel.;Jacket foundations have complex structures that enhance the reef effect and generate weaker vibrations than monopile foundations, albeit more than gravity foundations. Therefore, the foundation type, material and coating can be specifically chosen to influence the levels of settling larvae, the extent of the reef effect and the level of noise (vibration) disturbance (Table 1.1). In general, monopile foundations emit most noise but have least impact on the seabed community in terms of fouling, reef effect and space occupation. Conversely, gravity foundations and jacket foundations emit lower noise but impose a higher change on the benthic community.
