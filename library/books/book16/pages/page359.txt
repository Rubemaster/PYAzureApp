An overview of the analytical framework applied during ORJIP for determination of empirical avoidance rates is shown in Figure 6.11. Mesoavoidance was quantified by comparing the observed density of bird tracks (measured as track length per unit area) inside the rotorswept zone (with a 10 m buffer) of monitored turbines with a hypothetical situation in the absence of the wind farm, in which the same total track length would have been observed in the windfarm area (Figure 6.12). The formula for mesoavoidance was thus;Figure 6.11 Analytical framework applied to determine of empirical avoidance rates in the ORJIP Bird Collision Avoidance study.
