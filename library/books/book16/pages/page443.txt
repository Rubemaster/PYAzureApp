Searches revealed relatively few examples of the application of targeted mitigation measures for birds in the offshore environment. As a result, the possible application of measures adopted onshore was also considered, specifically by inviting opinion in the form of boxed case studies from selected researchers. This included the case of painting blades to increase visibility to vulnerable bird species (Hodos 2003 Johnson et al. 2007 May et al. 2017) and the potential to reduce collisions from temporary turbine shutdown (Tom et al. 2017a). In effect, these studies provide real examples of the application of measures or the processes involved. Moreover,many of the concepts to reduce effects, particularly in relation to displacement and indirect effects that are presented, remain hypothetical and require testing.;No literature on mitigation of effects of OWFs on bats was found. This is primarily because basic knowledge is still accumulating on the extent of the migration of bats in specific areas where OWFs are being developed, such as the Baltic Sea, as well as the more general potential for bats to occur offshore, especially in the USA (Petersen et al. 2016 see Hppop et al. 2019 for a review of literature). As a result, an opinion piece on the topic of potential interactions of bats with offshore turbines and the ways in which any negative effects may be mitigated is provided (Box 8.1). Otherwise, birds are the primary focus of this chapter.;In the terrestrial environment, the risk of wind farms to bats from collision or barotrauma during migration, investigation or foraging is well documented (Arnett et al. 2008 Baerwald  Barclay 2009 Brinkmann et al. 2011 Kunz et al. 2007 Cryan et al. 2014 Jameson  Willis 2014 Rydell et al. 2010 Voigt et al. 2015). Observations in the Baltic Sea and North Sea have provided evidence that bats also approach and forage within wind farms (Ahln et al. 2007 2009 Lagerveld et al. 2014), other offshore installations (Seebens et al. 2013 Hppop  Hill 2016 Bach et al. 2017) and vessels (Sonntag et al. 2006 Walter et al. 2007). Bats have also been found foraging at sea, up to 2.2 km from the German Baltic coast in June (Seebens et al. 2013), although the importance of atsea prey resources such as moths and other insects to bats remains unknown. It is also unclear to what extent insects are attracted to wind farms as a result of the colour of the structures (Long et al. 2011), or lighting, given that they may be the only refuge for many miles at sea. There is also the potential for bats to roost in windfarm
