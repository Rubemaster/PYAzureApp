Collision risk is particularly influenced by avoidance rate, flight height and flight speed of birds (see Informing collision risk modelling, below, and Cook  Masden, Chapter 5). The flight height of breeding Lesser Blackbacked Gulls wasexamined using altitude recorded by the GPS tags. A Bayesian statespace model based on speed and location, with 4 kmh classed as flight (after ShamounBaranes et al. 2011), showed that gulls flew higher over land than at sea, and lower after dark than during the day. In more detail, mean flight altitudes were around 10 m at sea and during the day, and 50 of observations classed as marine were within 12.8 m of sea level, in contrast to 50 of observations within 5.6 m after dark (RossSmith et al. 2016). A total of 31 of daytime flights at sea overlapped with the turbine rotorswept risk area of 30 258 m, which concurred with previous studies using boatbased estimates (Johnston et al. 2014). Overall, the study was highly informative in gauging exposure to collision risk.;There are many ways in which telemetry data can be analysed to reveal potential interactions with offshore wind farms. Often an initial step is to simply overlay tracks with an area of interest, to determine connectivity with locations of interest (see Establishing foraging ranges and connectivity in the breeding season and Connectivity of birds to source colonies during the non breeding period). Kerneltype approaches including Brownian bridges, or gridded quantification of intensity of use such as time spent (e.g. Soanes et al. 2013 WarwickEvans et al. 2016 Thaxter et al. 2017) can then be used to further determine the core and total areas used within the home range, alongside time budgets for a given protected population (e.g. Harris et al. 2012 Langston et al. 2013 Wade et al. 2014 Thaxter et al. 2015) (Figure 4.2) (see Box 4.3).;Additional sensors on tags can provide deeper understanding of behaviour and potential use of locations in space and time (Harris et al. 2012 T. Cook et al. 2012 Brown et al. 2013 Waggitt  Scott 2014 ShamounBaranes et al. 2017) (see Box 4.1). However, even in the absence of such sensors and the information they provide, movement models,
