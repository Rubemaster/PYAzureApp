The German Offshore Wind Energy Act devolves new responsibilities within the German EEZ to the BSH. In addition to MSP and the licensing and monitoring of OWFs, BSH shall publish a sectoral development plan for offshore wind energy, the sitedevelopment plan (Figure 9.9), in accordance with the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA), whose responsibilities lie with the grid development and tendering of renewables both onshore and offshore. The site development plan designates areas for the development of wind turbines, grid corridors and the location of converter platforms within the EEZ for the period 20262030. The site development plan determines specifically when BNetzA will invite tenders for which area, while aiming at a spatial and temporal coherence of commissioning OWFs and their connection to the grid. Besides efficiency criteria, such as the use of existing grid connections and the expected capacity in an area, which depends on wind conditions and area geometry, preference is given to areas where fewer conflicts, such as with conservation interests, are expected (BSH 2018). With the new legislation, the BSH provides information for the different areas, which are invited for tenders starting in 2021. Information comprises data on the marine environment, seabed, wind and oceanographic conditions and is crucial for developers to place bids (BreuchMoritz 2018).;Figure 9.9 Scheduled procedural milestones for the site development plan 2019 Flchenentwicklungsplan 2019 (FEP) (BSH 2018), including Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA).
