The linetransect methods employed for visual aerial surveys for OWFs were first introduced for characterisation of seabird communities around the first proposed wind farms in Danish and Swedish waters (e.g. Kahlert et al. 2000). These methods were thenadopted by other aerial survey teams in Germany (Diederichs et al. 2002), the Netherlands (Poot et al. 2011) and the UK (Department of Business, Energy and Regulatory Reform BERR, unpublished report 2007), and reinforced by Camphuysen et al. (2004). Where visual aerial surveys continue, at the time of writing the same methods are still employed.;In essence, the methods of Kahlert et al. (2000) require that a twinengined, fixedwing, highwinged aircraft (Figure 3.10) be flown at a speed of 185 kph 80 m above the sea. Two observers in the aircraft, with one looking at each side, record birds continuously along the transect, dividing observations into three distance bands delimited by angles of 6025, 2510 and 104 from the horizon, which at the recommended survey altitude correspond to 44163 m, 164432 m and 4331,000 m from the transect line. Where the aircraft was fitted with bubble windows (Figure 3.10) surveyors attempted to count within an additional band, 043 m from the transect line. In the UK, the middle band was subdivided to give bands of 164262 m and 263432 m (Department of Business, Energy and Regulatory Reform BERR, unpublished report 2007) to give more degrees of freedom to modelled detection functions used for estimating detection rates of birds at greater distances from the transect line (Dean et al. 2004). This approach was not adopted for surveys in continental European waters because of the higher species diversity potentially leading to observer swamping (I.K. Petersen, personal communication, 2007).
