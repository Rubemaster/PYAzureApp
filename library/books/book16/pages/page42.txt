Figure 1.7 Mosaic seafloor image based on remotely operated vehicle video imagery used to analyse feature coverage such as the red algae Lithothamnion spp. (Uni Research, Bergen);The epifouling community on turbine foundations and scour protection have been studied extensively (Andersson et al. 2009 Andersson  hman 2010 Gutow et al. 2014 de Mesel et al. 2015). Nondestructive underwater photography with a fixed frame and video transects are classic methods used by marine biologists and are particularly valuable where the sampling efficiency of other physical sampling methods is low or where the succession of fouling organisms over time is to be monitored. Scientific scuba diving is one of the more traditional multipurpose survey methods, although at some sites where it is impossible to conduct diving surveys because of strong currents for example, ROVs may be used to obtain photographs or videos (Figure 1.7). Both methods deliver high quality images that enable the identification of much of the epifauna present. These images cover a small area of the structures (or seafloor) and do not provide information on the overall distribution of faunal communities. It is also important to note that smaller ROVs are restricted by their limited capability to operate in currents in excess of 1.5 knots, as well as by the water depth and the length of umbilical connection.
