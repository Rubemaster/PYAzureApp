At highenergy sites with mixed surface types and a faceted seascape comprising various habitat types, a mix of different gear and sampling approaches may be used. A baseline study was conducted at a planned OWF off the Norwegian coast (Dahlgren et al. 2014). The site is unique in that the seabed had a complex bathymetry dominated by rocky outcrops with patches of boulders, coarse sand and gravel. Dense forests of a kelp, Tangle Laminaria hyperborea, dominated at depths ranging from 5 to 20 m. Deeper sites had bare rocks, stones, pebble or coarse gravel covered byencrusting red algae such as Lithothamnion spp. This type of habitat is notoriously hard to sample, and quantitative sampling gears such as grabs are useless. It was further exposed to full ocean wave action, and strong currents limited the possibility of conducting transect studies using scuba divers. Instead, a combination of grabs (at deeper, 80 m, sedimented sites within the area), rock dredges and video collected with ROVs was used (Figure 1.6). To facilitate data extraction from the video transects, randomised samples of 10 m seafloor images were constructed using mosaics from the raw video data (Figure 1.7) (akov et al. 2015). Subsequently, these mosaic images were assessed for area cover using various features defined by different pixel characteristics, such as colour. Benthic fish were also monitored using a full range of passive gear such as crab pots, fyke nets, bottomset longlines and gill nets (see Monitoring benthic and demersal fish, below). The feature and species distribution data from the benthic habitat mapping were further used to model the distribution of certain species and features such as kelp, sea urchins (e.g. Echinus spp.) and sea stars (Asterias asterias and Marthasterias glacialis) (Schlppy et al. 2014). Based on the foreseeable change in a set of descriptors, these models can be used to hypothesise on the future impact of the wind farm (Schlppy et al. 2014 akov et al. 2015).
