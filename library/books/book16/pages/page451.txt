To date, there is consensus that only a few species, such as Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo and Great Blackbacked Gull Larus marinus,are attracted to wind farms, with Common Eider Somateria mollissima consistently indifferent, and species such as divers (loons) (Gavia spp.), alcid auks and Northern Gannet Morus bassanus generally avoiding wind farms (Vanermen  Stienen 2019). Asmore information becomes available there may be surprises, such as the unforeseen avoidance of turbines under construction by Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis at one site (Harwood et al. 2017). There is a clear need to understand the speciesspecific behaviour and the drivers for the response of birds, such as the role of fear of the novel even where there is little risk, relative to potentially disturbing factors such as vessels and any changes in the available resource base (Perrow 2019). Further understanding could increase the options available for reducing potential effects and impacts.;Figure 8.2 provides a conceptual overview of possible sitelevel spatial planning options that could be adopted for the purposes of mitigation. The options available to reduce impacts broadly divide into four areas (1) avoiding specific areas important to birds, (2) reducing the affected area, (3) reducing barrier effects, and (4) increasing permeability. It is important to note that while the first two options may both reduce potential collision and displacement (and also perhaps indirect effects), application of the second two options may involve a tradeoff between displacement and collision as these two effects are more or less mutually exclusive, as displaced birds cannot collide (Perrow 2019). Thus, reducing the level of displacement may increase collision risk for species using the airspace occupied by turbines. The tradeoff between encouraging birds to use a wind farm relative to the benefits of discouraging them needs to be made on a casebycase basis.
