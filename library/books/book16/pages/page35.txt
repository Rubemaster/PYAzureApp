Figure 1.3 Small fishing vessel set up for Viviparous Eelpout Zoarces viviparus survey fishing using fyke nets. Note the tank on the port side for live transport of captured fish. (Thomas Dahlgren);In all, 50 and 17 females were captured in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Biometrics, condition and reproductive success were assessed, comparing the windfarm site with natural reference sites in the same area. Analysis in the laboratory showed that the operational wind farm had no impact on either the condition on the brood development of female Viviparous Eelpout. In supplementary capturemarkrecapture studies, 716 individuals were marked in Lillgrund and in two control sites for the assessment of population dynamics. The results indicated that Viviparous Eelpout neither specifically aggregated in, nor avoided the wind farm. Furthermore, no clear reef effect attracting the species to the foundations and scour protection was observed. Since there were no differences in the parameters of Viviparous Eelpout measured 5 years after the installation of the wind farm in comparison with the natural surroundings, these studies indicate good environmental status and no impact (either positive or negative) of the Lillgrund wind farm.
