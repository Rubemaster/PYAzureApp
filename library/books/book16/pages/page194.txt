As well as answering the fundamental question of how far birds range or travel (Wakefield et al. 2009), data obtained from telemetry can identify key habitat used by marine birds offshore that is essential to determine whether birds are using areas of sea that may also be developed for offshore renewable energy, and if particular habitats within those areas are used more than others. Understanding the impacts of an offshore wind farm (OWF)development on a particular population is a crucial aspect to quantify before any wind farm is consented (Bailey et al. 2014 Horswill et al. 2017). In Europe, important populations of birds, including breeding marine birds, are protected as features of Special Protection Areas (SPAs), designated under the European Unions (EUs) Birds Directive (2009147EC), which together with Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), designated under the EUs Habitats Directive (9243EEC), form the Europewide Natura 2000 network. If birds within the population are to be affected, with implications for the integrity of the site, this may trigger a Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA).;Studies using telemetry are increasingly being conducted to determine location in space and time and quantify potential bird windfarm interactions (e.g. Perrow et al. 2006 Langston et al. 2013 Wade et al. 2014 Thaxter et al. 2015), and are providing further information using other sensors, greatly enhancing our knowledge of how animals are using their environment. For example, acceleration or activity loggers can distinguish behaviours and refine our understanding of habitat use (Weimerskirch et al. 2005 Bouten et al. 2013 ShamounBaranes et al. 2016), and time depth recorders monitor diving behaviour and together with positional information can help to reveal important foraging sites in relation to OWFs (Harris et al. 2012 T. Cook et al. 2012). Altimeters and Global Positioning System (GPS)derived flight height information are increasingly being used to demonstrate flight heights of marine birds to determine whether this brings them into potential conflict with turbine rotors (e.g. Cleasby et al. 2015 Ross Smith et al. 2016 Thaxter et al. 2018a). In turn, estimating the risk of collision remains a key component of windfarm EIA and assessment of risks for protected species such as within HRAs for birds from SPAs within Europe (see Cook  Masden, Chapter 5).;The considerable and rapid advances in telemetry systems used to track marine birds, especially since the 1990s, has been the subject of a number of reviews (RopertCoudert  Wilson 2005 Hooker et al. 2007 Burger  Shaffer 2008 Hart  Hyrenbach 2009 Bridge et al. 2011 Brown et al. 2013). Development continues apace, particularly as a result of miniaturisation of tags allowing smaller, more efficient devices to be used on a wider range of
