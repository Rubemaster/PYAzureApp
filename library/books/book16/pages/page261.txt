Ironically, subsequent changes to collision risk modelling using generic flight heights as recommended by SNCB (2014) guidance would have reduced collision estimates and mayhave allowed the project to be consented. However, by 2017 the subsequent use of laser rangefinders to estimate the height of Sandwich Terns at sea (Perrow et al. 2017) were more in line with the original flight heights presented in the Environmental Statement, tending to confirm the basis of the original decision. This illustrates how the timing of planning applications while guidance and evidence evolves can lead to different project outcomes.;Firth of Forth. In October 2014, the Scottish Government consented four offshore wind projects in the Firth of Forth. These consents were challenged by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) via judicial review. Although this is a review of process, much was made of whether stakeholders had been permitted sufficient consultation on the methods used for collision and population modelling. The final result, in favour of the Scottish Government, was reached by the UK Supreme Court in November 2017. During this threeyear period, significant legal costs were incurred by all parties including the petitioner (RSPB) and one project risked the loss of its Contract for Difference. The fact that Scoping Opinions for these projects were received in 2010 and issues identified at an early stage illustrates the difficulties of rationalisation and agreement on process.
