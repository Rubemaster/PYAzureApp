No use of the wind farm was recorded in 2004, with use increasing annually thereafter (Figure 4.10), mirroring the increase in the use of offshore areas farther from the colony in later years. Piledriving during construction was thought tohave affected the adult population of locally spawning Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus that, in turn, reduced the abundance of youngoftheyear, the most important prey item for breeding Little Terns at North Denes (Perrow et al. 2011a). But whereas prey supply was low in all years, the colony was small in 2004 (peak of 17 nests), of average size in 2005 (peak of 196 nests) and very large in 2006 (369 nests at peak), potentially increasing the range of individual foraging trips. Furthermore, while heavy predation of chicks by Common Kestrel Falco tinnunculus was noted in 2005, when an estimated 455 chicks were taken and only 11 fledged, supplementary feeding of the main Common Kestrel pair was thought to reduce chick predation to low levels in 2006, when an estimated 673 fledged. High demand for prey by Little Terns against a backdrop of low availability seemed to increase the use of the wind farm, where the development of a series of subsidiary sandbars formed as deposition tails downdrift of the turbine bases provided suitable foraging habitat (Perrow 2019).;Figure 4.10 Foraging tracks (n128 individual bouts) of tagged Little Tern from the North Denes colony (ND) in 2004 (n10), 2005 (n46) and 2006 (n72), showing increasing use of the wind farm.;Importantly, tracking data also provided a means of estimating collision risk in 2005 and 2006 when some use of the wind farm was recorded.
