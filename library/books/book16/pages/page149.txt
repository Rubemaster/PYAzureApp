0.001Data on wingspan and length from the British Trust for Ornithology (2018). The Vstatistic is derived from the pairwise difference between observations made using the two methods. A P value could not be calculated (PNA) during the analysis for counts of Common Gull.;Figure 3.8 Mean density (1 SE) derived using the box and radial snapshot methods for the variety of mediumsized seabirds sampled, as well as all birds comprising a range of large to small species.;It was therefore concluded that the use of the box snapshot method and the use of a larger sample area that is not effectively sampled in density calculations, underestimated the density of mostly mediumsized flying birds (see Table 3.1) in this case. It is important to note, however, that it was not possible to make a comparison for both small and large species
