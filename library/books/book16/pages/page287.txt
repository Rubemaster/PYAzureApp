Figure 5.8 Lefthand axis the probability of the Sandwich Tern population declining by more than a number of five differing percentage points relative to the reference population size (i.e. the median population under the baseline scenario) when subjected to levels of additional collision mortality ranging from 0 (baselinescenario) to 800 individuals per year. Righthand axis the magnitude of the mean population decline after 25 years of additional collision mortality as that mortality increases from 0 to 800 individuals per year.;Figure 5.9 Change (relative to the baseline scenario) in the probability of the Sandwich Tern population declining below a range of threshold values at levels of additional collision mortality ranging from 0 (baseline scenario) to 800 individuals per year.;NE and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), the Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies advising DECC, adopted an approach to interpreting PVA outputs which sought to identify the upper threshold to the predicted number of collision fatalities that would keep within certain limits (1) the absolute probability of the population ending up below certain threshold sizes, and (2) the increase in those probabilities between the unimpacted and impacted scenarios. The intention was to identify a level of collision mortality that, given the stochasticity in the system, could be assessed as posing an acceptably low risk or an acceptably low increase in the risk of the notified population of the SPA declining. This goal is conceptually different from identifying an absolute level of population decline that might be considered acceptable.
