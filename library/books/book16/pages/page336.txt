Figure 6.7 A migrating Noctule Nyctalus noctula spotted in the hours of daylight. (John Larsen);Altogether, vesselbased detector surveys recorded ten bat species migrating over or foraging in Kalmar Sound. While most bats simply passed by the ships, some bats started to circle and investigate the vessel as soon as it was encountered. Bats were also observed to forage on insects that had drifted from shore. Nonmigrating species Daubentons Bat Myotis daubentonii and Pond Bat M. dasycneme were also observed to occur offshore. Thermal imaging recordings of bats, such as N. noctula and P. nathusii,revealed flight heights of 1040 m above
