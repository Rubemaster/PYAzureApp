Figure 5.6 Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis breeding at Blakeney Point, which, along with the Scolt Head colony, comprises the internationally important population designated within the North Norfolk Coast Special Protection Area. (Martin Perrow);Discussions between the interested parties considered the fundamental advantages of individualbased models rather than the matrixbased approach employed in many available software packages. As a result of these discussions, a bespoke population model called ViaPop was developed. Population representation was individual based that is, each live individual was explicitly represented within the model. This individual representation avoided structural oversimplification and allowed stochastic processes to act at an individual level features which gave greater population realism. Population processes were simulated as discrete sequential events, which acted in a probabilistic manner on individuals (or pairs). Full details of the model structure and operation are provided in Mackenzie et al. (2009 2010) and Mackenzie (2011a 2011b).;Where possible, population parameters were determined directly from the relatively wellstudied North Norfolk colonies (Table 5.2) Survival rates were determined by analysis of British Trust for Ornithology ring recovery data, and estimates of other parameter values were derived from published literature. A board of experts approved the parameter values used.
