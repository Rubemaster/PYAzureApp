Figure 3.2 Location of transects used for surveys of the Dogger Round 3 Zone (a) relative overall coverage intensity of boatbased transects that was achieved (b) typical survey pattern followed by digital aerial surveys with intense coverage of Tranches A and B.;An environmental statement was submitted to the regulatory authority for the Creyke Beck projects in 2013. The analysis carried out for the ornithological technical report within this statement combined both boatbased and digital aerial survey data to assess the abundance and distribution of different seabirds present in the project areas (Forewind 2013). The analysis was based on data models in which it was assumed initially that the high detection rates from the digital aerial surveys were 100 efficient, but the low rate of identification to a species level from this survey platform in the early surveys (23) required that the proportions of each species be taken from the boatbased surveys, where identifications were assumed to be 100 accurate. The novel method for analysis combined the boatbased spatially explicit abundance data with those of the digital aerial survey and spatially explicit environmental covariates using binomial generalised additive models (Johnston et al. 2015). The preference for digital aerial data for abundance estimation was made because of differences in calculated abundances of species groups, which were likely to have been caused by the greater detection efficiency of digital aerial surveys and the responsive behaviour of seabirds to the boatbased platform
