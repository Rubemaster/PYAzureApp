Figure 3.7 Diagrammatic representation of the area surveyed by a 300 m radial snapshot over 90 on one side of the vessel (blue) or over 180 on both sides of the vessel (blue and green combined) demarcated by a white line, compared to the equivalent box snapshot on one or both sides of the vessel. The maximum distance across the box is shown. In this study, each snapshot type sampled both sides of the vessel.;As collision risk is almost invariably a critical part of wind farm EIA, it is crucial that the density of flying birds is accurately estimated. However, while the box method allows relative measures of flying bird abundance to be estimated, which may be perfectly adequate for the purposes for which it was designed, there are conceptual issues with its use to provide accurate density measures. To begin with, the maximum distance across a 300300 m box at 45 from the surveyor is actually 424 m (Figure 3.7), with 20 of the area to be sampled in the box beyond 300 m, the distance set for transect width perpendicular to the vessel. This means that the surveyors are required to continually adjust the distance at which they should be scanning in order to place birds within an imaginary box. Even if this could be achieved, surveyors are
