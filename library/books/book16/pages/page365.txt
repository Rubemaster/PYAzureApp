Multisensor systems that assemble components of the remote sensing technologies described in this chapter provide the best solution to quantify interactions between turbines and birds and bats offshore. Ideally, such systems would be fixed to each individual wind turbine of a wind farm. As a minimal solution, the authors recommend the installation of one multisensor system in each corner as well as in the centre of a wind farm (a total of five systems) to ensure balanced sampling of birds and bats entering the wind farm and inside the wind farm, irrespective of flight direction. However, the diversity of available systems renders comparability among different systems almost impossible. To gain a better understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of the effects of a wind farm and ultimately cumulative impacts of winds farms on the phenology and dynamics of bird and bat populations, coordinatedmonitoring of multiple wind farms using the sampling design outlined should occur simultaneously. In this way, estimates on macroavoidance can be better obtained, as reported, for example, for migratory geese (Plonczkier  Simms 2012), through which energetic costs of circumventing wind farms could be assessed. In the longer term, such a concerted empirical approach would improve model parameterisation, validate current CRMs and improve their predictive performance.;We are grateful for financial support from the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation through the project BIRDMOVE (grant no. 3515822100).;Ahln, I.
