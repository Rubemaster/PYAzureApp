Finally, should there be a trial of contrast painting in the offshore environment, experiences at Smla show that it is important to paint rotor blades before they are installed. Even onshore, it turned out to be practically difficult and therefore costly to paint the rotor blades, as this could only be done incalm weather and from the hub downwards.;Restricting the speed of turbine blades may reduce collision risk via two pathways (1) increasing the visibility of blades, and (2) reducing the probability of a bird flying through the swept area being hit. In general, stationary turbine blades are likely to produce a much smaller risk to birds than rotating blades (Drewitt  Langston 2008). Therefore, temporarily shutting turbines down, or curtailment, when there is a clear threat is likely to be highly effective. Appropriate shutdown periods may be identified through realtime monitoring of bird flocks using radar or visual observations (e.g. de Lucas et al. 2012 Fijn et al. 2015). Temporary shutdowns can be applied to all or some of the turbines in an array, but would need to be highly targeted to specific periods such as when key species are most active, migration is occurring or weather conditions increase the risk of collision (Gartman et al. 2016b). Such measures have been successfully adopted at a number of onshore wind farms, with an emphasis on protecting raptors, and can be tailored to specific situations (Box 8.4).
