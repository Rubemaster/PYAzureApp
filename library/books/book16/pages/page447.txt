The most promising mitigation measures onshore have been the temporary shutdown of turbines when bats are likely to be present during migration (Baerwald  Barclay 2009 Arnett et al. 2010 2011 2013b Brinkmann et al. 2011 Rodrigues et al. 2015 Arnett 2017 Behr et al. 2018). Research at onshore wind farms has also shown bat activity to be correlated with weather, including wind speed, temperature and rain (Horn et al. 2008 Bach  Bach 2009 Behr et al. 2011 Brinkmann et al. 2011 Amorim et al. 2012). Bats also generally prefer low wind speeds of 4 ms, though this may be variable, and high temperatures (Ahln et al. 2007 2009 Arnett et al. 2008 Poerink  Haselager 2013 Lagerveld et al. 2014). Below themanufacturers cutin speed, turbines freewheel without producing electricity, although the rotational speeds achieved may be more than sufficient to kill bats, and therefore Arnett (2017) suggested that raising the cutin speed by at least 1.5 ms (range 1.53 ms) would have the effect of preventing the turbines rotating until the cutin speed is achieved, thereby significantly reducing the number of bat mortalities. Feathering the blades, that is, pitching the blades to 90 and parallel to the wind, below cutin speed also has the effect of reducing bat mortality. While this type of mitigation, particularly during bat migration periods, shows promise, the cutin speeds would be best tailored to specific species and sites.;In relation to potential compensation measures, Peste et al. (2015) provide a review of several possible approaches to enhance assemblages of bats that have been negatively impacted. For example, they suggest management of autochthonous forest, diversification of forest and agriculture monocultures, preservation of existing roosts, provision of new roosts and creation of ponds. However, such compensation measures may be ineffective if the origin of the bats passing offshore turbines is unknown.;More research is required to inform understanding of general bat migration across large, open bodies of water and bat behaviour at OWFs. To assess the potential impact of planned or existing sites, specific atsea bat surveys are needed during Environmental Impact Assessment (BSH 2013 Peterson et al. 2014 Rodriguez et al. 2015 Sjollema et al. 2014 Bach et al. 2017), and during and after construction (Lagerveld et al. 2014). Experience of monitoring at onshore sites (e.g. Hein 2017) should be used to develop offshore survey methods and assessments, with modifications to account for the conditions and size of the structures and arrays.;Besides avoiding building wind turbines in areas intensively used by bats (migrating andor foraging), temporary shutdowns during periods of high bat activity (mainly autumn migration period) are likely to be the most effective mitigation measure, with only minor economic impacts (Brinkmann et al. 2011).
