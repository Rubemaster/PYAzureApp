All of these techniques can be applied to the different research questions that emerge throughout windfarm life cycles (see Introduction above). As also highlighted in the Introduction, the majority of windfarm impact assessments have been conducted in European waters. As there are emerging developments outside Europe, a case study is included from Taiwan, where windfarm development is in its initial phase.;It cannot be emphasised enough that there must be a clearly defined research question at the heart of any study focusing on the impact of windfarm development on marine mammals. The type of monitoring methodology employed will also be influenced by the species under study and the timeframe available in which to conduct the study. Research questions may include the identification of species present, the distribution, in time and space, of these species and how far reaching the potential impacts of individual windfarm development might be. Assessing cumulative impacts of windfarm developments is also becoming increasingly important. There are existing techniques that can address such questions however, emerging tools are likely to improve data collection efficiency and, therefore, increase the ability to detect changes in marine mammal population abundance, distribution and behaviour.
