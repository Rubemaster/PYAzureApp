Although hydroacoustics have been in use for some time and arerelatively sophisticated, the limitations in species determination still make it difficult to observe pelagic fish and burrowing species, and to estimate fish length and shape in schools. Other difficulties include reflections from other marine organisms such as jellyfish and squid Loligo spp., which can be misinterpreted, as well as backscatter from the seafloor and windfarm structures potentially masking aggregating fish. Nonetheless, there have been developments in the technology, particularly for use in highly energetic environments where weather windows are rare (Hvidt et al. 2006).;Finally, individual telemetry has been used to investigate the behaviour of larger benthopelagic species such as Atlantic Cod (Reubens et al. 2013 2014a 2014b 2019), showing seasonal patterns of presence but also detailed behavioural traits such as habitat selectivity at a small spatial scale. Such studies have been extended to investigate the response of fish to construction noise (Box 1.3).;Previous research on the effects of offshore wind farms (OWFs) has shown that once the turbines are constructed, the scour bed, that is the hard substrate surrounding the base of each turbine, has a strong positive influence on the presence of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua in the area (Reubens et al. 2013). Atlantic Cod inhabit the offshore artificial structures during summer and autumn and use the scour beds as feeding grounds (Reubens et al. 2014a). The presence of offshore turbines therefore has an effect on the number and distribution of Atlantic Cod in the North Sea. However, how the construction
