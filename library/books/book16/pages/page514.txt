Although offshore windfarm (OWF) development in Europe was one of the major drivers for the marine spatial planning (MSP) process, the USA provides another narrative of marine planning being well established while OWF development is still in its early stages. Only recently has the offshore industry spread beyond its northern European home to North America (GWEC 2018 54), with the first OWF in the USA, and North America in general, being commissioned off the coast of Rhode Island in 2016. Responsibility for Marine Spatial Plans is generally a prerogative of the individual federal states, although plans must be prepared in close cooperation with the federal authorities. State jurisdiction is traditionally limited to a zone of 3 nautical miles (Burger 2011), while the EEZ beyond this, to 12 nautical miles offshore, encompasses federal water (UN 1982). While OWF development is usually under the jurisdiction of the federal agencies within the EEZ, the grid connection and onshore facilities are administered by state authorities.;MSP in the USA was driven by other discourses over the use of the sea, such as conservation, fishing and relevant indigenous rights, aquaculture (State Ocean Caucus 2017) and transportation (EEA amp CZM 2015). Marine Spatial Plans were first established in 2009 in Massachusetts (Ocean Management Plan) and Oregon (Territorial Sea Plan). With the National Offshore Wind Strategy issued in 2016, steps were undertaken at the strategic policy level to promote and encourage OWF development in the USA. Aiming to achieve a total of 86 GW of installed offshore wind energy capacity by 2050, this federal policy could boost OWF developments. Furthermore, some states have issued adjusted and often ambitious offshore wind energy targets, including New York State with 2.4 GW by 2030, New Jersey with 3.5 GW by 2030 and Massachusetts with 2.0 GW by 2020.
