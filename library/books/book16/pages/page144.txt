Trial analyses of birds in flight in radial snapshots, based on survey data from the Celtic Sea, UK, identified clear decreases in detectability with distance for some seabird species such as the smallsized (27 g and 38 cm wingspan BTO 2018) European Storm Petrel Hydrobates pelagicus (n77 observations) as well as the mediumsized (690 g and 67 cm wingspan BTO 2018) Common Guillemot Uria aalge (n313 observations) (Figure 3.6). The probability density functions for these species appear to be reasonable as they approximate to a normal distribution and reflect the limited availability of birds close to the vessel and reduced detectability with distance (Figure 3.6). Observations at the same site supported the viewthat neither European Storm Petrel nor Common Guillemot were attracted or repelled by the vessel. Overall probabilities of detection were similar for both species, at 0.33 and 0.31, respectively. Clearly, correcting density estimates based on these analyses could lead to much larger population estimates within the surveyed areas, with possible implications for impact assessments.;Figure 3.6 Examples of fitted detection functions (top) and the associated probability density functions (bottom) from point transect distance analysis for (a) European Storm Petrel Hydrobates pelagicus and (b) Common Guillemot Uria aalge derived from boatbased radial snapshot surveys in the Celtic Sea, UK.;Linetransect methods do not fit well for flying birds recorded in snapshots by the ESAS method, partly because of the difficulty of estimating the distance to flying birds. For example, the Heinemann (1981) method cannot easily be applied to flying birds at variable distances from the water surface and is too slow for use in moderate or higher bird density. The use of rangefinders at sea shows promise however (Borkenhagen et al. 2018 Harwood et al. 2018), but will also be slow and difficult to use at moderate or high bird density. Moreover, it is difficult to account for responsive movement of seabirds to the survey platform, which may take place at several
