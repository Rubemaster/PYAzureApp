Wind farms can potentially affect marine mammals at any stage of project development. This chapter outlines the range of monitoring methods that can be used to investigate changes in marine mammal abundance, distribution and behaviour, over long and shortterm periods, in order to evaluate both windfarm impacts and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies put in place during construction activities. Data on population abundance and distribution over a larger spatial scale are typically obtained from systematic surveys from vessels or aircraft limited to periods of good weather and daylight hours. Such visual surveys provide good spatial coverage in a relatively short time, thus presenting a snapshot of marine mammal occurrence and distribution. Towed passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) arrays that record marine mammal vocalisations can also be used in poorvisibility conditions at night or during rough seas. Detection of finescale changes in habitat use or behaviour, however, is best undertaken through continuous monitoring with static or fixed PAM, provided the species under study is acoustically distinctive and vocalises regularly. Such devices generally archive data for later retrieval, although new realtime data transmission devices are becoming available. Acoustic monitoring can also provide information on behaviour, such as foraging, and may be the only feasible method where populations occur at low density or are cryptic. Ideally, a combination of both visual and acoustic monitoring methodologies provides the best spatial and temporal coverage. Telemetry can be
