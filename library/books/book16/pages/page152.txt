Borkenhagen et al. 2018) to train observers, assess their accuracy and consistency, and calibrate the flightheight distributions that they deliver is to be recommended (Harwood et al. 2018).;Camphuysen et al. (2004) made a clear recommendation about the size, speed and type of ship that was acceptable for use in ornithological surveys at OWFs, with a preference for vessels 20 m in length and the need for surveyor eyeheight 5 m from the sea surface, which is particularly important for detection of birds on the sea surface (Figure 3.9). This recommendation arose because many small and often unstable fishing boats were chartered for some of the first ornithological surveys at wind farms, potentially compromising data quality. Following this recommendation, the size and stability of the boats chartered improved for the large part.
