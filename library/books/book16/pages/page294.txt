The use of both CRMs and population models has become a keypart of the consenting process for the offshore wind industry. However, there remains relatively little consensus over some of the approaches that are used. This can contribute to significant costs for all stakeholders involved in the process (Box 5.1). Key challenges relate to ensuring that uncertainty is adequately captured by the consenting process and that the models and parameters used are evidence based and biologically realistic.;There is recognition about the value of guidance and standardised parameters for use in models. However, while they may represent the best available data, there are question marks about how representative many of these representative values are. For example, the recommended speed of 13.1 ms for Blacklegged Kittiwake, viewed as one of the key species in relation to collision risk (Garthe  Hppop 2004 Furness et al. 2013), is based on two tracks recorded using radar over a period of 11 minutes in Sweden (Alerstam et al. 2007). In contrast, a study using laser rangefinders estimated a much slower mean flight speed for Blacklegged Kittiwake, at 8.71 ms, based on short tracks of 296 birds (Skov et al. 2018), although this is based on data from a single location in favourable weather conditions. Such examples highlight the uncertainties in the data used at present. The widespread use of technology, such as GPS tags (see Thaxter  Perrow, Chapter 4), is likely to enable more representative measurements to be used in the future (e.g. Fijn  Gyimesi 2018). The use of more empirical data such as obtained from tracking data is likely to be welcomed by industry and other stakeholders (Box 5.1). The move towards incorporating estimates of uncertainty into CRMs is likely to be welcomed. However, consideration needs to be given to whether it is possible to develop these models further, for example with the use of tracking data to gain more accurate assessments of collision risk.
