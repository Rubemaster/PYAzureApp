In this Volume 4, documenting monitoring and mitigation as the solutions to any conflicts offshore, the concept was to cover themain groups that have been the focus of monitoring efforts, namely birds, especially seabirds, marine mammals, fish and invertebrate communities. As relatively little work has yet to be conducted on fish, these are included with invertebrates in the opening chapter Monitoring invertebrates and fish, before subsequent chapters on Monitoring marine mammals and Surveying seabirds. Both the Monitoring invertebrates and fish and Monitoring marine mammals chapters include information on telemetry, with the latter perhaps providing the most relevant information on any telemetry of mega fish such as sharks, or even sea turtles required in future windfarm studies. Such has been the rapid advance in, and popularity of, the application of telemetry in relation to birds, including both seabirds and migrant terrestrial species such as waterfowl a separate chapter on Telemetry and tracking of birds is warranted. This concludes the monitoring section of the volume, before a switch in focus to Modelling collision risk and predicting populationlevel consequences. The recent work offshore expands that conducted onshore and documented in Volume 2 of this series, notably in trying to tackle the greater degree of unknowns offshore, where the rate of collision cannot be confirmed through carcass collection, as it may be onshore. This has stimulated the technological advance of remote methods to detect collisions in the challenging conditions at sea that are thoroughly reviewed in Measuring bird and bat collision and avoidance, and that provides the means of populating the collision risk models covered in the previous chapter. The chapter also includes exciting work on the telemetry of small migratory birds such as passerines, that have similar traits to bats, to complement the earlier Telemetry and tracking of birds chapter.
