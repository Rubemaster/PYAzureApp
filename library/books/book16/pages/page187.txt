CHRIS B. THAXTER and MARTIN R. PERROW;Tracking and telemetry are routinely used in ecological studies of birds. The attachment of telemetry devices (or tags) to individuals, can, at its simplest level, record the spatial movement of a species of interest, which has numerous applications in the assessment of interactions of marine birds and migrant waterbirds with offshore wind farms. The initial application of telemetry in Europe has expanded to include other countries where developments are being proposed. Telemetry is useful in (1) scoping species and sites that could be affected by developments throughout the year at different scales, (2) identifying the exposure of species to particular effects of wind farms prior to construction, and (3) quantifying impacts and monitoring behaviour once the wind farm has been constructed. To scope species and protected sites, breeding season foraging range reviews and direct tracking information have been used to identify potential or realised connectivity between protected sites and wind farms, to quantify intensity of habitat use and potential overlap with wind farms, and to assess the scale at which wind farms may have bearing on species populations. Telemetry has also been used to quantify the potential effects of displacement or avoidance, collision risk and barrier effects associated with constructed wind farms, thereby helping to validate assessment predictions. Finescale movements around individual wind turbines are now being
