No detailed information about system performance, such as the range of detection of nocturnal birds, is available. However, in principle the detection range is dependent on bird size and weather conditions. In daylight, larger birds, such as raptors and vultures, for which the system was originally developed, are detected at adistance between 400 and 1,000 m (Figure 6.8), while smaller birds, such as passerines, are recorded under favourable weather conditions if they are less than 50 m away from a DTBird unit. Taxonomic identification of birds is possible to the group level (Ahmad et al. 2013). Following bird detection, DTBird software monitors birds approaching a wind turbine in real time. If monitored birds cross into a predefined safety zone, DTBirds Dissuasion Control module is designed to trigger the emission of deterrent calls to encourage threatened birds to move out of the hazardous zone. If birds continue flying towards the rotorswept airspace, DTBird software will automatically shut down the respective turbine with the mitigation module Stop Control. Finally, the Collision Control module is designed to register bird collisions with rotor blades. DTBird also stores sound records of each bird detected visually. All recorded data can be reviewed, for instance, to check for false positives, that is videos without a bird. On average, the daily rate of false positives is less than 1.5, but this increases to up to four per hour during unfavourable weather. Moreover, large remotely distant objects, such as aircraft, also trigger video recording (Hanagasioglu et al. 2015). Such false positives will erroneously initiate automatic shutdown of wind turbines, suggesting that this technology needs further research and testing (Gartman et al. 2016).
