Figure 3.13 Still grab from a digital video aerial survey showing a group of Northern Gannet Morus bassanus in flight.;All review and identification is done manually as, in the experience of HiDef, all automated systems tested to date do not perform sufficiently well against human counterparts in terms of efficiency and accuracy. All video footage is reviewed and all objects of interest are marked for subsequent analysis. Some 20 of video reels (a reel is the video material from a single camera along a single transect) are subjected to a random blind audit by an experienced operator, and if there is less than 90 agreement between review and audit, then all of that reviewers material for the day is reassessed.;All objects detected during the review phase are assessed by expert ornithologists and marine mammologists who classify these to the lowest taxonomic order possible, assigning these to both species group and, where possible, to species. Each identification is given a confidence rating of possible, probable or definite, equivalent to low, medium or high confidence. Additional details are recorded at this stage, where possible, of age, sex, behaviour
