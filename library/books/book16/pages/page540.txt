German energy policy resulted from the enactment of the Offshore Wind Energy Act (WindSeeG 2016), which also introduced a tendering system for OWFs at sea. WindSeeG adopts an integrated approach by coupling grid development and OWF deployment at sea. This brought forward a more detailed planning scheme and scale, the socalled site development plan (Flchenentwicklungsplan), which supplements the MSP efforts (Figure 9.8). The funding rates for OWF development now follow competitive tendering, cutting costs considerably, with the average allowance at 0.44 ctkWh (BNetzA 2017). By 2026, a central model is to be put in place, which invites bids once a year for an average of 700900 MW annually (WindSeeG 2016).;Figure 9.8 Proposed areas for offshore wind farms in the German Exclusive Economic Zone in the North and Sea as sketched in the second draft of the site development plan Flchenentwicklungsplan (BSH 2019).
