Figure 8.2 Examples of sitelevel spatial planning approaches that could reduce impacts on birds by avoiding development of areas associated with the highest risk, minimising the area affected, limiting barrier effects and increasing the permeability of the site to birds. See Masden et al. (2012) for further consideration and modelling in relation to some of these concepts;Dealing with the four options in turn, the simplest approach to reduce potential impacts is to avoid areas that have been identified as most important for birds within the developable area. In the authors experience, there are a number of examples where, during the planning stages, developers have decided to modify the areas available for development in order to reduce consenting risk. For example, during characterisation of the Round 3 Firth of Forth Zone using boatbased surveys, Scalp Bank was identified as being important for birds, in accordance with available literature (Wanless et al. 1998 Harris et al. 2012). As a result, Scalp Bank was excluded from the Phase 1 project development areas (Seagreen Wind Energy 2018). Similarly, at the Round 2 Race Bank in the Greater Wash, areas of particularly high use by Sandwich Terns
