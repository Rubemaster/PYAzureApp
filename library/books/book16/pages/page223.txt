The Scroby Sands wind farm, comprised of 30 2 kV Vestas V80 turbines, was installed between October 2003 and August 2004 approximately 23 km east of North Denes, part of the only SPA designated solely for Little Tern Sternula albifrons in the UK. At that time, the colony was the UKs largest, averaging 188 pairs from 1986 to 2006 representing more than 10 of the UK population. A 5year study was initiated from 2002 to 2006 inclusive to understand the interactions between breeding Little Terns and the wind farm. After 2 years of an intensive boatbased survey programme with six to eight surveys per season, there had been no records of Little Terns within theprospective wind farm and there was concern that a low intensity or intermittent use of the wind farm once it was built would go undetected, leading to the conclusion that there was no possible risk of collision with turbines, when this might not have been the case. As a result, the paradigm of monitoring the bird using its habitat rather than monitoring the habitat and describing its use by the bird was adopted and radio tagging of Little Terns was attempted for the first time. To the authors knowledge, this was the first application of tracking in the study of the interactions between birds and OWFs.;After capture at the nest in 20042006 inclusive, a total of 22 birds (n4, 9 and 9, respectively) were fitted with 1 g radiotags (Biotrack Ag376379) comprising about 2 body weight, which were glued to the back feathers and designed to be shed naturally after a short time (Figure 4.9). Tags were operational for an average of 12 days. Tracking was undertaken from a 6.3 m rigidhulled inflatable boat capable of high speed (30 knots). Details of tagging and tracking procedures are provided in Perrow et al. (2006).
