Figure 5.3 Approaches used to assess the populationlevel consequencesof collisions range from very simple, for example summation of the number of affected birds, to more complex approaches such as potential biological removal (PBR), population viability analysis (PVA), individualbased model (IBM) and integrated population model (IPM).;At the simplest level, the populationlevel consequences of collisions with wind turbines may be assessed using a straightforward summation of the predicted number of collisions. While this approach has been widely used in onshore assessments, more recent offshore assessments have typically taken more complex approaches (Humphreys et al. 2016). Simple summation offers a clear, and easily interpretable, measure of the total number of birds liable to be affected by collisions at any given time. This can then be compared to the total population size or, if the data allow, some assessment of baseline mortality in the absence of any wind farm. However, predicting the populationlevel consequences over the lifetime of a wind farm becomes more challenging, as simply projecting estimated collisions into the future ignores recruitment and natural mortality in the population concerned.;PBR was initially developed for use in relation to the harvesting of marine mammal populations for commercial purposes (Wade 1998), and was further developed for use in relation to anthropogenic impacts on bird populations (Niel  Lebreton 2005 Dillingham  Fletcher 2008). PBR provides an estimate of the maximum level of mortality, in addition to that expected to occur naturally, which a population can experience and still remain viable. The PBR algorithm is as follows;PBR was initially developed for use in relation to the harvesting of marine mammal populations for commercial purposes (Wade 1998), and was further developed for use in relation to anthropogenic impacts on bird populations (Niel  Lebreton 2005 Dillingham  Fletcher 2008). PBR provides an estimate of the maximum level of mortality, in addition to that expected to occur naturally, which a population can experience and still remain viable. The PBR algorithm is as followswhere Rmax is the maximum intrinsic growth rate of a population, Nmin is a conservative estimate of population size, and f is a
