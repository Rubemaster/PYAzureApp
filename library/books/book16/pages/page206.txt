Figure 4.5 Overlap of 24 GPStagged Lesser Blackbacked Gulls with offshore wind farms during the breeding season (ca. March to August) across three years, 20102012. Kernel density estimate contours are shown, with 95 in blue representing total area use, 75 in yellow, and 50 in red representing core area use.

(2015).;Of the birds initially tagged, a total of 19 birds provided further data during nonbreeding periods in subsequent years. Six birds tagged in 2010 provided data for the 201011 non breeding period. Thereafter, 15 birds provided data in 201112 and 11 in 201213, including birds tagged in the 2010 or 2011 breeding seasons. These nonbreeding movements were then mapped in relation to OWFs (see Figure 4.6 for 201112), and revealed that birds from Orford Ness showed connectivity with proposed wind farms in the English Channel and off the coast of France, as they migrated mostly to and from Iberia and into North Africa (Figure 4.6).
