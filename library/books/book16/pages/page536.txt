Knowledge on MSP has changed over the years and the first MSP amendments are underway in Germany these cover a timespan from 2018 to at least 2021 (BBSR 2017). Globally, various baseline surveys and marine mapping results have become available and have been further elaborated (e.g. BfN 2018 Commonwealth of Massachusetts 2018 MARCO 2018). Ambitious tools and platforms have been established (Table 9.2), providing better planning baselines than a decade ago, but information is still limited and cumulative assessments remain beset by uncertainties (Willsteed et al. 2017 2018). In Germany, at least the results from the responsible agencys database should be available these draw on proponents relevant obligations that have been set by the standard investigation programme StUK 4 (BSH 2013b). Overall, Willsteed et al. (2017, p. 19) argue for a shift away from disparate EIAs and limited SEAs, and a move towards establishing a common system of coordinated data and research to ecologically meaningful areas.;Table 9.2 Selected geospatial marine planning tools.;California Offshore Wind Energy Gateway, USAhttpscaoffshorewind.databasin.org
