Following Dillingham  Fletchers (2011) application of potential biological removal (PBR) to albatrosses and petrels in New Zealand, the windfarm industry in the UK was quick to utilise what is a relatively straightforward means of calculating sustainable thresholds of additional mortality for seabird populations. PBR analysis is thought to have been used first in the ornithology technical report that underpinned the ornithology chapters of the Environmental Statement (ES) and Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) for Triton Knoll (NIRAS Consulting 2012a 2012b). In their response to the Secretary of State regarding the Triton Knoll application, the Written Representations of Natural England (NE) and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) accepted the use of PBR, provided necessary precaution was applied. With agreed amendments to the model parameters, PBR was used to produce sustainable threshold limits for Blacklegged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (Figure 5.4) and Northern Gannet Morus bassanus at Flamborough Head and Bempton Cliffs Special Protection Area (a European designation under the EU Birds Directive, 2009147EC) as well as the wider populations of Lesser Black backed Gull Larus fuscus and Great Blackbacked Gull Larus marinus that were of concern (Natural England 2012).
