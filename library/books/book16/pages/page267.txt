Boatbased survey data collected as part of windfarm pre construction surveys also enabled the development of continuous flight height distributions (Johnston et al. 2014), an approach subsequently applied to data collected using Global Positioning System (GPS) tags (RossSmith et al. 2016), digital aerial survey (Johnston  Cook 2016) and light detection and ranging (lidar) (Cook et al. 2018b). These have been incorporated as an addon to the offshore Band model (Band 2012), referred to as option 3 or the extended Band model. This has two key advantages. First, it allows the proportion of birds at collision risk height to be inferred in situations where data are limited andor unavailable. Secondly, it allows the model to account for the fact that birds towards thelower edge of a turbines rotorswept area are at a lower risk of collision, because the blades occupy a lower proportion of the total rotorswept area than they do towards the midpoint of the rotor swept area (Band 2012). The onshore Band CRM and both versions of the offshore version are deterministic. However, an update of the offshore version (Masden 2015 McGregor et al. 2018) has enabled the introduction of stochasticity into the modelled estimates of collision risk (Figure 5.2). This enables predicted collision rates to be expressed as an estimate with associated confidence intervals.;Figure 5.2 Evolution of the Band collision risk model. Initially, this was available for the onshore environment as an Excel spreadsheet (Band et al. 2007). The model was then refined as part of the Strategic Ornithological Support Services (SOSS) process to more accurately reflect data collection in the offshore environment (Band 2012). A stochastic version of the offshore model has since been developed (Masden 2015) and made available as a web application (McGregor et al. 2018).
