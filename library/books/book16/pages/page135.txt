In 2013, at the start of the postconstruction monitoring programme, it was agreed to use HiDefs GEN II digital video aerial survey method and not use boatbased or visual aerial surveys, which were used extensively during baseline surveys, to investigate the postconstruction distribution and abundance of key seabird species, including Common Scoter Melanitta nigra, Redthroated Diver Gavia stellata, Northern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialis, Northern Gannet Morus bassanus, Little Gull Hydrocoloeus minutus, Common Gull Larus canus, Lesser Blackbacked Gull Larus fuscus, Common Tern Sterna hirundo, Common Guillemot Uria aalge and Razorbill Alca torda, with a focus on detecting and measuring potential displacement effects. Given the relatively small spatial extent of boatbased surveys around the wind farms, any changes in the distribution of seabirds were compared to the baseline visual aerial survey data only using spatially explicit modelling methods contained in the MRSea application (ScottHayward et al. 2013). It was important to account for some large changes in overall abundance of many species throughout the wider study area, but particularly of Redthroated Diver, in the wider Greater Wash, which otherwise would have swamped changes in relative distribution patterns within the region. Some of these changes were likely to be attributable to the use of improved digital aerial survey methods for the postconstruction surveys, but also to real population changes in the Greater Wash with a marked increase between the baseline preconstruction phase and the construction phase which persisted into the operational phase of the project.;For most species and species groups, including gulls, terns and auks, no displacement effects were detected. In contrast, significant displacement of Redthroated Diver (Figure 3.3) and Northern Gannet was found. Effects were apparent by their geographical location and by comparison of the average abundance at different distances from the wind farms as a percentage of the average abundance in the Greater Wash. It was possible to detect these effects because of an appropriate number and geographical extent of postconstruction surveys, each covering approximately 12.2 of the 1,282 km2 Greater Wash study area, and the use of novel spatially explicit data modelling methods (Webb et al. 2017).
