Of the remaining three projects, after initial consent, Neart na Gaoithe and Inch Cape were subject to judicial review linked to concern over significant impacts on internationally important populations of breeding seabirds in combination with sites in the nearby Round 3 zone. The judicial review was initially upheld and consents were overturned, although the Inner House later reinstated the consents (OffshoreWIND.biz 2017). Revised applications for fewer, larger turbines were submitted, and received consent in the case of Neart na Gaoithe (NnG Offshore Wind 2018), with the decision pending on Inch Cape (Inch Cape Wind 2018). The only STW site currently under construction at the time of writing, Beatrice, is is expected to be fully operational in 2019.;Moving into the future, the UK will be leasing tenders for Round 4 of offshore wind in 2019, maintaining a pipeline of projects through to the late 2020s and beyond (Crown Estate 2019). The proposed tender for Round 4 is likely to foresee capacity to be increased from 6 GW to 7 GW,  available regions to be extended from 50 m to 60 m water depths and additional work to be commissioned on key issues of uncertainty, including further assessments on MPA sensitivities, ornithology and visibility analysis (Crown Estate 2018). Following extensive stakeholder engagement, the Crown Estate has undertaken spatial analyses (including other sea uses, environmental sensitivities and technical resources), and proposes to include five regions in plans for a new leasing round, on the basis that they are technically feasible, include sufficiently large areas of available seabed for offshore wind development and have lower levels of development constraint (Crown Estate 2018). In addition, four regions are proposed for further consideration, with an increased evidence base required to better understand seabed resources and constraints (Crown Estate 2019).;In Germany, the coastal waters up to 12 nautical miles are governed by the states, whereas federal planning covers the EEZ. MSP plans are subject to SEA under the German EIA Act. A driving force for
