A number of static acoustic devices have been used extensively in windfarm marine mammal monitoring surveys, such as the C POD and its predecessor, the TPOD (Figure 2.8). These have been used in multiple studies of Harbour Porpoise in northwestern European waters, such as the study at Egmond aan Zee (OWEZ) in the Netherlands (Figure 2.9) (Scheidat et al. 2011 Lindeboom et al. 2011). The TPOD was developed in the 1990s to investigate Harbour Porpoise bycatch in set net fisheries (Tregenza 1998) and was designed to be robust, yet lightweight, and easy to deploy and retrieve by fishers. The TPOD has continually evolved, and today, the CPOD and Deep CPOD are commonly used in the monitoringof Harbour Porpoise and other toothed whales (e.g. Brandt et al. 2009 van Polanen Petel et al. 2012). Ideally, CPODs are deployed in relative close proximity to each other within the windfarm area, say at 5 km intervals, and then at greater distances (perhaps to 10 km) from the wind farm. For example, at the Gemini wind farm deployed montoring devices at 5 km, 7.5 km and 10 km (Figure 2.10). It is important that the coverage of CPODs extends to many tens of kilometres from the wind farm as the displacement distance for species such as Harbour Porpoise may be in excess of 20 km during construction (e.g. Tougaard et al. 2009 Dhne et al. 2013).;Figure 2.8 CPODs deployed on large buoys during a monitoring project for Groningen Seaport.
