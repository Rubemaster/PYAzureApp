The scan is carried out primarily by the naked eye, but with the additional support of binoculars on occasion, especially where seaduck and divers (loons) (Gaviidae) are known to be present. Those birds that occur within a 300 m wide strip parallel to the transect line within that arc are recorded as being in transect using different methods according to whether they are recorded as flying or sitting on the sea (Figure 3.4). All sitting birds are recorded as being in transect, whereas those flying birds that occur within the limits of a defined zone in the 300 m strip at the time of a snapshot count are recorded as being in transect. A snapshot count fixing the bird in time and space is designed to compensate for the slow speed of the survey platform relative to the bird and allow calculation of density, as otherwise simply recording all birds seenis only a relative measure of flux, which may be correlated with density, but is not a measure of absolute density.;Figure 3.4 The strip transect, scan and snapshot zones used in the European Seabirds at Sea (ESAS) method. The transect zone is depicted by all areas within 300 m of the transect line and subdivided into smaller zones. The scan zone is depicted by the dotted line and the snapshot zone by the shaded rectangle.
