Figure 2.11 An example of four different CPOD parameters used to describe the acoustic activity (per day) of Harbour Porpoise Phocoena phocoena in a windfarm area using a beforeafter controlimpact (BACI) approach. PPM porpoisepositive minutes. (From Scheidat et al. 2011);Anchoring devices such as CPODs in the long term can be challenging. In some areas, such as the OWEZ wind farm, the most suitable deployment method was to suspend the CPOD from large buoys to reduce the possibility of equipment loss due to adverse weather conditions or trawling activities (Figure 2.8). In other areas, CPODs are deployed with remote acoustic releases, or two anchors connected by a submerged floatline that can be hooked and hauled up (Anonymous 2016). In areas of sufficiently shallow water, divers can be used to retrieve acoustic devices (Le Double 2018).;The quantity and quality of data that telemetry studies facilitate are extremely detailed (Bailey et al. 2014 Aarts et al. 2016a) and provide the basis for indepth investigations of the impact of human
