As a continuously operating acoustic collision detector system, ID Stat can be used to obtain patterns of windfarm effects at broader spatial scales as well as on the timing of collisions (Collier et al. 2012) if used at multiple turbines. One directional microphone is attached at the base of each rotor blade inside the hub of a wind turbine. Sound spectra of collision events are logged and transmitted by the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network. To calibrate ID Stat, objects weighing as little as 2.5 g were shot at the blades of a wind turbine (Delprat  Alcuri 2011). In addition, filtering software eliminates ambient noise from rain and the operational noise from the turbines. Confirmation of collision events was not possible from images or species identification of fatally collided individuals (Collier et al. 2011 2012 Ahmad et al. 2013). ID Stat has been tested with one onshore wind turbine in western France, although to the best of the authors
