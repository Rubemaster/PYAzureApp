However, to the authors knowledge, there had been no comparative test of the counts and densities supplied by the two different techniques until their preliminary investigation in the Firth of Forth off the east coast of Scotland in October 2017. In the oneday survey aboard a 17 m Severn class ex lifeboat with an eyeheight of 6.1 m, a transect length of 148 km was surveyed using 283 snapshots at fixed 500 m intervals, adopting both box and radial snapshot methodssimultaneously. Two surveyors accustomed to the box method (one exclusively so) each surveyed one side of the boat, which were combined to produce counts and according density estimates for a 600300 m box with an area of 0.18 km2. A single surveyor accustomed only to the radial method sampled both sides of the boat, that is over 180, using a radial distance of 300 m, giving a snapshot area of 0.141 km2.;Only pairs of snapshots in which at least one flying bird was recorded by either technique were taken forward for analysis. The recordings included n120 for all birds combined, n63 for Blacklegged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, n35 for Razorbill Alca torda, n21 for Common Guillemot Uria aalge and n13 for Common Gull Larus canus. Too few records of European Storm Petrel Hydrobates pelagicus, Northern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialis, Northern Gannet Morus bassanus, Great Blackbacked Gull Larus marinus, European Herring Gull Larus argentatus, Little Gull Hydrocoloeus minutus, Little Auk Alle alle and Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica were obtained to enable speciesspecific comparison, but these were all included in the all birds comparison.;ShapiroWilk tests showed that both count and density data were not normally distributed and thus nonparametric methods were used. Wilcoxon signedrank tests for paired data with continuity correction in R software (R Core Team 2018) revealed no significant differences in counts between the two techniques (Table 3.1) despite the difference in the area being surveyed. A closer investigation of the data revealed that there were only three occasions on which additional single birds were recorded in a box relative to a radial snapshot, strongly suggesting that surveyors did not generally see birds at distances greater than 300 m. As a result, significantly higher densities of all species (and group) considered were recorded in radial compared to box snapshots (Table 3.1, Figure 3.8), simply because of the greater area used in the latter relative to the similar number of birds seen.
