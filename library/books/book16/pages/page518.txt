The authors prior experience with the emergence of MSP, especially in Germany and its early SEA approaches, may be summarised as follows. At the time of writing, Johann Kppel and Gesa Geiler serve as members of the scientific advisory board for the amendment of the MSP plans for the German EEZs in the North and Baltic Seas. Experiences of the initial phases of Englands MSPand SEA for Rounds 1 and 2 of offshore wind development are drawn from Ines Kruppas 2007 PhD thesis, as supervised by Johann Kppel, although more recent experiences from the UK have been included from the literature. In 2016, Michelle Portman published Environmental Planning for Oceans and Coasts, regarded as a seminal book in its field. She lead the initiative for Israels first MSP plan and worked for the State of Massachusetts in coastal and marine management at the time the first Ocean Management Plan was developed for the states waters. Marie Dahmen is a research assistant with the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH), where she coordinates the EU project Strategic Environmental Assessment on North Seas Energy (SEANSE) and is part of the planning team for the revision of Germanys MSP plans.;SEA for plans and programmes provides a tool to assess the likely environmental consequences of MSP plans and to include participatory procedures into decisionmaking processes. Although neither the Kyiv Protocol on SEA nor the European SEA Directive specifies MSP to be directly subject to SEA, MSP plans have to undergo an SEA since, for example, they set a framework for future development consent of projects listed in Annexes I and II to Directive 85337EEC (European Parliament amp European Council 2001 UNECE 2003). The MSP Directive itself refers to the SEA Directive, in stating that if maritime spatial plans are likely to have significant effects on the environment they are subject to Directive 200142EC, and should hence undergo an SEA.;In their framesetting role, some MSP plans are guiding future OWF development through zoning approaches. This is the case in the MSP plan for the Belgian part of the North Sea (Belgian Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment 2014b). The plan delineates a zone for awarding domain concessions for the construction and exploitation of installations for generating
