Under the current trajectory of telemetry and tracking developments, such ambition is possible. If the past is a precursor to the future, new families of devices with everimproving technologies, including smaller, more streamlined designs, lighter in weight with more efficient battery life, more sensors and greater functionality, can be expected. Smarter ways of attaching tags, such as the use of different harness materials or weaklink harnesses are being explored, crucial also for minimising the potential impacts that tags and attachments may have on birds (Box 4.2). Not only would this allow more species, including lighter ones, to be tracked, but a greater volume of information would be produced, giving an enhanced understanding of ecology and interactions between marine birds and their environment. It is likely that tracking and telemetry will continue to provide ever more useful solutions to resolve conflicts between marine bird populations and OWFs.;The case studies on Lesser Blackbacked Gulls (Box 4.3) and migratory waterbirds (Box 4.5) presented in this chapter were funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), superseded by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), with thanks in particular to John Hartley (Hartley Anderson), Emma Cole, Mandy King, Sophie Thomas and James Burt (DECC) for their support. Also in relation to Lesser Blackbacked Gull research, thanks to the National Trust, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Natural England for permissions, and to all who have helped with discussions and fieldwork, in particular to Willem Bouten and Judy Shamoun Baranes (University of Amsterdam, UvABiTS) and Mark Rehfisch (formerly BTO) for support. The UvABiTS tracking studies are facilitated by infrastructures for eScience, developed with support of the NLeSC (httpwww.esciencecenter.com) and LifeWatch, carried out on the Dutch national einfrastructure with support of SURF Foundation. The study on Little Terns at Scroby Sands (Box 4.6) was funded and supported by E.ON Renewables Development Ltd, with additional data for 2013 commissioned by Natural
