Figure 2.2 The survey blocks and designed transect lines for the ObSERVE Acoustic surveys 20152016. The northern region was considered as a single survey block, while the geometry of the shelf break in the southern region required stratification. (From Berrow et al. 2018 https www.dccae.gov.ieimagesObSERVE20Acoustic20Colour20Coded 20Survey20Lines.jpg);One challenge posed by cetaceans is that they spend a considerable amount of their lives underwater and are not always available to be observed. Furthermore, when cetaceans are at the surface, observations may be missed owing to poor weather conditions, making it difficult to detect their brief surfacing, or simply by the observer failing to detect an animal that is on the surface. If the survey aim is to obtain an absolute estimate of abundance, the chance of observing a sighting on the transect line, called g(0), must be quantified. If g(0) is not calculated, density will be underestimated. A number of different methods have been used to estimate g(0) and these methods differ between ship and aerial surveys (Box 2.1).
