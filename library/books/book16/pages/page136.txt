Figure 3.3 Changes in relative abundance of Redthroated Diver Gavia stellata (inset) between baseline and second postconstruction year in relation to the Lincs and Lynn and Inner Dowsing combined windfarm areas, with  signs showing significant increases relative to baseline and  signs showing significant decreases. (Inset Martin Perrow);In the absence of before data (for whatever reason), it is also possible to analyse the gradient of changing seabird densities in relation to distance to the wind farm to infer a windfarm impact (Welcker  Nehls 2016), although any reference to baseline conditions will clearly help with the interpretation of the findings (Webb et al. 2017). When analysing largescale effects extending 10 km or farther, such as observed at Lincs wind farm in the UK (Box 3.2), it is likely that environmental gradients such as water depth or salinity in estuarine environments will interact with windfarm
