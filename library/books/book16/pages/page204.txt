Figure 4.3 Example tracks and kernel density distributions for Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica from GPS tags (igotU GT120) attached to birds at the Isle of May, southeast Scotland, overlain with areas of proposed offshore windfarm developments ( Crown Estate 2012 updated). Maps show (a) all fixes of Atlantic Puffins, (b) density contours based on all locations, and (c) density contours based on diving locations. In (b) and (c), 50 (red), 70 (yellow) and 90 (blue) contours are shown. (Adapted from Figure 2 in Harris et al. 2012, reproduced with permission of the British Trust for Ornithology);Chris B. Thaxter  Viola H. RossSmith;Since 2010, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), in collaboration with the University of Amsterdam, has tracked the movements of Lesser Blackbacked Gulls Larus fuscus graellsii in relation to proposed, consented and operational offshore wind farm (OWF) areas. This study, carried out on behalf of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), superseded by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), had the following main aims (1) to investigate connectivity between protected seabird populations and OWFs throughout the year, (2) to determine the variability in exposure to effects of OWFs, and (3) to examine flight heights to inform collision risk.;The study was conducted at Orford Ness, part of the Alde Ore Estuary Special Protection Area on the Suffolk coast, at a declining colony of 550640 actual occupied territories. A total of 25 birds (11 in 2010 and 14 in 2011) were captured at the nest during incubation using a walkin cage trap, and a GPS tag (Bouten et al. 2013) weighing 19 g was attached using a wing harness (see Thaxter et al. 2015 for more information) (Figure 4.4). Data from the GPS tags of 24 birds were downloaded
