Channel on the breeding population of Northern Gannets on Alderney. The model used tracking data to investigate how the impact of birds either colliding with turbines or avoiding the planned developments would affect the birds at a population level. However, it is noted that, in addition to tracking data, such models require information about the physiology of the species concerned (WarwickEvans et al. 2017).;In the early 2000s, proposals to develop several offshore wind farms (OWFs) in the Greater Wash were being considered. Each of these developments had the potential to lead to collisions of Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis breeding at two colonies within the North Norfolk Coast Special Protection Area (SPA) (Figure 5.6). Accordingly, the Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) process required the government regulators then the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to assess the likelihood of this additional mortality leading to an adverse effect on the integrity of the SPA. At the time, Maclean et al. (2007) had recently reviewed the potential use of population viability analysis (PVA) to assess the impact of OWFs on bird populations. As a result of that,Natural England (NE) requested work by the developers to determine whether PVA could be used in this particular case. This work, conducted by ECON Ecological Consultancy Ltd. and the University of Essex, concluded that while there was a lack of definitive, sitespecific information on key demographic rates, PVA was the only tool available to evaluate the potential populationlevel impact of collision mortality as a result of the Greater Wash wind farms (Mackenzie et al. 2009 2010).
