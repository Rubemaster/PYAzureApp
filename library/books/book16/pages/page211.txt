Even small wading birds such as the Piping Plover Charadrius melodus that could interact with the Block Island Wind Farm in the USA are now being studied throughout the year (UMass Amherst 2018). Combining geographic position and flight height information from GPS telemetry (see also Informing collision risk modelling, below) offers a meaningful way of determining potential vulnerability of species to wind farms through their annual cycle. For example, Thaxter et al. (2018b), in studying movements of Lesser Blackbacked Gulls through the year for three breeding colonies, quantified the distance that individual birds travelled at altitudes between the minimum and maximum rotorswept zone of wind turbines, as an index of sensitivity to collision risk this layer was then combined with the location of wind turbines (exposure) to estimate potential spatiotemporal vulnerability. Such mapping exercises could inform the siting of wind farms to minimise potential impact, and areas where mitigation may be explored further at locations where vulnerability may be greatest.;The Wildfowl  Wetlands Trust (WWT) has used tracking data recorded since 2006 to provide information on swan and goose migration routes in relation to offshore (and onshore) wind farm sites. The studies, initially on behalf of COWRIE Ltd and more recently for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) (formerly the Department of Energy and Climate Change), are being used to inform the Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) programme being undertaken by BEIS, by highlighting key areas where the proposed offshore wind farms (OWFs) may pose a risk, and the potential for cumulative effects alongside existing wind farms located on the flyway.
