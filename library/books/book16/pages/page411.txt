Several windfarm projects have provided field experience with the sound emissions of vibratory piling. However, vibropiling was not used to drive the piles to target depth in any of these cases. At the German pilot wind farm Alpha Ventus for example, 18 pin piles for six tripod foundations were vibrated 9 m down into the sandy seabed before hydraulic impact piling commenced. The measured SPL (averaged over 5 seconds, at 750 m) in vibratory piling was 142157 dB re 1 Pa while the measured SEL (singlestrike, at 750 m) in impact piling was 171175 dB re 1 Pa2 s (Betke  Matuschek 2011 Koschinski  Ldemann 2013). SPLs in the 100 Hz to 1 kHz frequency range were significantly reduced for the vibratory hammer compared to the impact piledriver (Betke  Matuschek 2011). At Riffgat OWF, the CAPE Holland Super Quad Kong, a combination of four inphase vibrodrivers, was used to install 30 large monopiles 1530 m deep into the seabed. After that,construction work involved impact piledriving with an IHC S1800 hammer to take the piles to target depth. The attainable penetration depth for each vibrated monopile varied with local seabed substrate properties. At 750 m, an SPL (50 percentile, averaged over 30 seconds) of 145 dB re 1 Pa was recorded for the vibratory piling (Fischer et al. 2013). In the absence of reference measurements without a noisemitigation system, this value must be compared against the predicted SEL (singlestrike, at 750 m) for impact pile driving at Riffgat, which was 180 dB re 1 Pa2 s (Koschinski  Ldemann 2013). However, the noise levels during vibrodriving were also well below the measured SEL (during the impact pile driving operations shielded by an IHC NMS6900 casing (see Casings, above).;At the Danish Anholt wind farm, two 5.3 m diameter monopiles were vibrated 1718 m into a sandy seabed using three synchronised PTC 200HD vibropiling units (PTC 2012). Owing to insurmountable resistance in hard soil, for one of the piles, the installation process used impact piling to achieve the last metres of the required pile depth. This allowed comparative noise measurements to be obtained. The average measured SPL (averaged over 30 seconds) was 153 dB re 1Pa for vibrodriving compared to an average SEL associated with impact piling of 172 dB re 1 Pa2 s (reference measurements taken across four piles). As noted in Box 7.1, while sounds of different metrics should be compared with caution, the measured peak SPLs at Anholt were reduced by 2628 dB (J. Kringelum, personal communication 2014).;Offshore pile installation by drilling is also considered to be less noisy than impact piledriving. Two main approaches to drilling technology may be distinguished (1) the drivedrilldrive concept and (2) pure drilling solutions. In drivedrilldrive operations, the installation process involves impact piledriving at the start of the process until the hammer meets resistance in a hard bottom layer. Then, the construction team inserts a drilling system in the pile, lowers it to the bottom and uses it to cut a shaft through the hard layers. Finally, the engineers switch back to the impact piledriver
