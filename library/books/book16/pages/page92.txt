Static acoustic devices play a dual role in windfarm monitoring as they can also be used to measure construction noise, particularly highimpulse piling sounds. These data can then be used to validate noiseimpact models and predicted impacts on marine mammal hearing apparatus (NMFS 2018), as well as to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Noise modelling is now anessential component of every windfarm assessment that has the potential to affect marine mammals (see Thomsen  Verfu, Chapter 7) (Box 2.2).;Commencing in 2019, Taiwan will develop extensive areas of eastern Taiwanese waters into offshore wind farms (OWFs). There is concern that this development will detrimentally impact the Eastern Taiwan Strait (ETS) Humpback Dolphin Sousa chinensis, a critically endangered population which numbers some 6070 individuals. The population has a restricted inshore range and is already subject to multiple threats from habitat degradation, coastal development, shipping and competition with fisheries (Figure 2.7). Although there is a port located within the dolphins habitat, the current ambient underwater noise levels are low (Guan et al. 2015) therefore, both the piling and increase in vessel traffic associated with windfarm construction have the potential to dramatically increase underwater noise levels. Any increase will pose an additional threat to an already compromised dolphin population. In 2016, a noise field characterisation study was conducted during test pile driving for the OWFs, to assess the potential impact on marine mammals (Chen et al. 2017). The aims of this study were (1) to characterise the underwater soundscape during demonstration piling (2) to identify the dominant sound sources in the vicinity of the piling area and, from these data (3) to assess the risk of auditory damage, auditory masking and disturbance to dolphins.
