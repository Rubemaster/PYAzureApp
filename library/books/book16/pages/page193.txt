Telemetry sensors can also reveal many other aspects of species biology and behaviour. Early studies using depth gauges based on capillary tubes have been superseded by hi tech pressure loggers that record time and depth for species diving underwater (Daunt et al. 2003) (Figure 4.1). Simply by using only the GPS fixes where diving data were also recorded by timedepth recorders (TDRs), Harris et al. (2012) were better able to identify key foraging areas of Atlantic Puffins from the Isle of May (see Figure 4.3 below). Diving activity may also reveal valuable information on predatorprey interactions, such as likely food obtained, through diving activity signatures (Elliott et al. 2008). Activity loggers have been used to reveal different behaviours while birds are at sea (Benvenuti et al. 2001). Accelerometery has been widely used to study diving and flight behaviour and refine our understanding of activity patterns, using measurements of gravity and speed in multiple axes of movement (Watanuki et al. 2003 Weimerskirch et al. 2005 ShamounBaranes et al. 2017). Other examples of telemetry include altimeters to measure flight height (Weimerskirch et al. 2005 Cleasby et al. 2015), heartrate loggers to measure metabolic rates and energy expenditure (e.g. Bevan et al. 1997 Ponganis 2007), prey ingestion loggers, including beak sensors (Wilson et al. 2007) and internal temperature loggers (Wilson et al. 1992) to understand prey consumption, wetdry loggers or saltwater switches to indicate movements in and out of water (Pinaud  Weimerskirch 2005) and tags that measure environmental features (Boehlert et al. 2001). Finally, cameralogger technology is also now permitting a direct birdseye view of habitat use and diet (e.g. Watanuki et al. 2008 Votier et al. 2013).;As well as answering the fundamental question of how far birds range or travel (Wakefield et al. 2009), data obtained from telemetry can identify key habitat used by marine birds offshore that is essential to determine whether birds are using areas of sea that may also be developed for offshore renewable energy, and if particular habitats within those areas are used more than others.
