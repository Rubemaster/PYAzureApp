Figure 8.10 European Herring Gull Larus argentatus with Common Tern Sterna hirundo chick snatched from the Rockabill colony in Ireland. Large gulls may be significant predators of other seabirds and compensatory measures of windfarm impacts on those species in some localities could benefit from increased control of gull populations. Ironically, in other locations it may be gull populations that require compensatory measures as a conservation priority. For example, European Herring Gull is redlisted in the UK (Eaton et al. 2015). (Martin Perrow);In theory, at the end of life of an OWF, decommissioning of all associated infrastructure, including the turbines, foundations, transition pieces, cabling, substations, meteorological masts, scour protection and any onshore components, should be undertaken to restore the area to as near to predevelopment conditions as is reasonably practicable. The onus is on the owner to ensure this is achieved under relevant licence conditions. In the UK, Section 105 of the Energy Act 2004 details the requirement to prepare decommissioning programmes that are applicable to OWFs.
