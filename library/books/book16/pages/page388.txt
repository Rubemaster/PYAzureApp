The source level is expressed as dB re 1 Pa m. It can be understood as dB re 1 Pa referred to 1 m as a measure of the acoustic output of a source. It is important to note that the source level is backcalculated to 1 metre using measurements from distances farther away from the source.;In a simplified approach, transmission loss can be described by geometric spreading. Geometric spreading can involve spherical spreading, which happens near the source or in deep water. Here, the sound can propagate uniformly in all directions. The TL is given by 20 log10 (R1m). This means that for each doubling of distance, the sound becomes 6 dB weaker. The other form of geometric spreading is cylindrical spreading, which happens in shallow water. Here, the sound can propagate only as a cylindrical wave bound by the sea floor and sea surface, with TL given by 10 log10 (R1m). This means that for each doubling of distance, the sound becomes 3 dB weaker. TL is often found to lie between 20 and 10 log (R) and thus 15 log (R) seems to describe TL quite well in some cases.;More advanced studies use numerical soundpropagation models in the determination of TL. All of the models available solve the wave equation under appropriate boundary conditions. Raybased models are widely used and are particularly useful at high frequencies. Wavenumber integration and normal modes are good at lower frequencies and solve rangeindependent problems. Alternatively, parabolic equation models are popular for rangedependent problems and are good for lowfrequency modelling. Parabolic equations are suitable for modelling transmission loss from pile driving.;Noise modelling results are often shown in sound maps (Figure 7.1), which are used in conjunction with data on the distribution and abundance of fish or marine mammals to provide an estimate of the number of individuals affected. The impact is then extrapolated using empirical data on hearing sensitivities and demonstrated effects.
