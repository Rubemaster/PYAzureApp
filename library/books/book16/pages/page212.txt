Cygnus cygnus (see Figure 4.1c in Box 4.1) at three Special Protection Areas (SPAs) of international importance for the species 20 at Martin Mere SPA in northwest England 15 at Welney, Ouse Washes SPA in southeast England and five at Caerlaverock, Upper Solway Flats and Marshes SPA in south west Scotland. Ten transmitters were also fitted to swans at breeding sites in Iceland during summer 2009 to provide additional data on their autumn migration, and five were fitted to swans at Martin Mere in 200910 to determine consistency in migration routes. The transmitters provided hourly location data between 1800 and 1100 h in spring (8 March to 15 May), and every 2 hours between 0600 and 2000 h in autumn (15 October to 29 November). Whooper Swans were thought to be at particular risk of collision because of their large size and low manoeuvrability, but many other species are similarly at risk. Therefore, existing tracking data held by WWT for Svalbard Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis, Greenland White fronted Geese Anser albifrons flavirostris and East Canadian Lightbellied Brent Geese Branta bernicla hrota were also examined. Data quality and sample sizes were most useful for Barnacle Goose as a result of location data recorded for 27 Svalbard Barnacle Geese fitted with 30 g or 45 g solar GPS PTT100 Argos transmitters (see Figure 4.1f in Box 4.1) from April 2006 onwards at the main wintering grounds on the Solway Firth. Location data were investigated to see whether a bird crossed the footprints of potential wind farms, defined as where the extrapolated track between two consecutive GPS fixes (minimum 12 hour interval) intersected the wind farm.;During the 200809 spring migration, a high proportion (75) of swans migrating from northwest England crossed at least one OWF footprint, compared with 7.1 tracked along the east coast from southeast England (Griffin et al. 2010). All wind farms traversed were those either consented or operational wind farms (Round 1 or Round 2) off the Cumbrian coast or in proposed Scottish territorial waters sites. No Whooper Swans were recorded flying across Round 3 wind farm footprints (Figure 4.7). The autumn 2009 and spring 2010 data indicated some variability in flight lines, with the autumn
