However, very little is known about the potential impacts of OWFs on bats. As with onshore wind farms, while offshore turbines may represent a significant collision risk, they are thought unlikely to cause displacement or disturbance of bats. Thus, the range of possible mitigation measures at onshore sites (Arnett 2017) seem likely to be applicable to offshore projects (see also Wilson et al. 2010). Many of the measures discussed in relation to birds in this chapter may therefore also beapplicable to bats, although site and speciesspecific knowledge is critical to the selection of appropriate measures.;As with birds, avoidance of impacts relies on ensuring that wind farms are not built in highrisk areas, including known migration routes or areas intensively used by bats. As little is yet known about offshore movements and habitat use, owing in part to difficulties surveying in the offshore environment (Petersen et al. 2016), this is rather difficult. Where wind farms cannot be resited to avoid potential impacts, there are a number of potential options for minimising and reducing risks. Deterrents, including ultrasound emissions (Arnett et al. 2008 2013a Horn et al. 2008) or radar (Nicholls  Racey 2007 2009), may provide a means of reducing collision risk. However, these methods are often costly, are currently unproven at operating wind farms, and could have negative impacts on other conservation interests such as seabirds that could counter any benefits accrued for bats (Amorim et al. 2012 Rodrigues et al. 2015). Minimising attraction to the site or a particular turbine could also reduce potential collision risk. Long et al. (2011) found that pure white and light grey colours seem to attract insects and consequently result in increased insectivore activity. Thus, coloration could be modified to reduce prey attraction. Furthermore, potential roost sites could be limited at an offshore array by limiting access to internal spaces, for instance using scrubbers (filters) on covers, as applied to some onshore wind turbines.;The most promising mitigation measures onshore have been the temporary shutdown of turbines when bats are likely to be present during migration (Baerwald  Barclay 2009 Arnett et al. 2010 2011 2013b Brinkmann et al. 2011 Rodrigues et al. 2015 Arnett 2017 Behr et al. 2018). Research at onshore wind farms has also shown bat activity to be correlated with weather, including wind speed, temperature and rain (Horn et al. 2008 Bach  Bach 2009 Behr et al. 2011 Brinkmann et al. 2011 Amorim et al. 2012). Bats also generally prefer low wind speeds of 4 ms, though this may be variable, and high temperatures (Ahln et al. 2007 2009 Arnett et al. 2008 Poerink  Haselager 2013 Lagerveld et al. 2014).
