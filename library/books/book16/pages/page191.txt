The onset of satellite relay systems permitted the gathering of locational data on animals anywhere on the planet (e.g. Jouventin  Weimerskirch 1990 Hart  Hyrenbach 2009). Platform terminal transmitters (PTTs) record location through the Doppler effect, whereby a shift in wavelength radiotransmissions occurs as the satellite passes overhead, allowing position to be determined (Maxwell 1971). Data can be transmitted back to the user through the Argos system, which has been widely used on pelagic seabirds and waterbirds (Phillips et al. 2008 Griffin et al. 2011) (see Figure 4.1). Tracking devices that use deadreckoning methods with heading and speed can also provide similar locational data (Wilson et al. 1991 Thaxter et al. 2010). In the early 1990s, the geolocation sensor (GLS) method was developed using light sensors that enable latitude and longitude to be derived using daylength and local timing of midday (Hill 1994). Geolocation is an archival technology requiring recovery of the tag by the user to obtain the data. Several important geolocation studies have taken place since the 1990s revealing the migration behaviour of many marine birds (Guilford et al. 2009 Harris et al. 2010) (Figure 4.1).;Geolocation suffers in accuracy of position (ca. 200 km), as issues of constant daylight or darkness around the poles and equal daylength at the equinoxes, respectively, prevent longitude and latitude being determined (e.g. Phillips et al. 2004). PTTs are advantageous in that they relay information directly to the observer, allowing completely remote capability. However, PTTs using the Doppler effect to determine position suffer from problems of accuracy, typically up to a few hundred metres (Weimerskirch et al. 1992), down to 150 m at best (Bridge et al. 2011). Further refinements in locational precision have been made through archival Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which can have locational accuracy of up to a few metres (Bridge et al. 2011). Early GPS tags were expensive, but now a wider range of more affordable devices has allowed many individuals of study populations to be tracked over shorter periods. For example, using lowcost and lightweight archival GPS tags (see Figure 4.1), the collaborative Future of the Atlantic Marine Environment (FAME) project, at the time of writing, has tracked more than 2,000 individuals of 12 species from 40 marine bird colonies since 2010 (RSPB 2018). Archival telemetry devices require recapture of the bird to recover the data. Combined approaches, however, have
