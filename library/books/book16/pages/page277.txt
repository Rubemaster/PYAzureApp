The values of CV and f are highly influential in the output of the model. Initially, f was suggested to represent the conservation status of the species. To this end, Dillingham  Fletcher (2008) utilised the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) criteria, with values of 0.5 for least concern species, 0.3 for near threatened and 0.1 for threatened species. Blacklegged Kittiwake is a clear example of how this can be open to interpretation. As the worlds most numerous gull species (Coulson 2011), a value of 0.5 may be applicable, although the species rapid decline in the UK (JNCC 2015) could imply a value 0.3 in a national or local context. However, the SNCBs advised a very precautionary approach to f (and CV), and optedfor a value of 0.1 in all assessments (Natural England 2014). For other species associated with SPA colonies, a maximum of 0.3 was applied except in the case of the rapidly expanding Northern Gannet population at Flamborough Head  Bempton Cliffs SPA, where 0.4 was used.;The importance of the selection of both f and CV in assessment is shown in Table 5.1 using a fictional Blacklegged Kittiwake colony with a breeding population of 10,000 and applying a survival rate of 0.82 (derived from North Shields and Marsden from 1955 to 1997) (Coulson 2011), and 4 years as the age of first breeding (Wernham et al. 2002). As the CV value decreases from 0.5 in intervals of 0.1, the sustainable threshold increases by only around 9, but more or less doubles with each 0.1 reduction of f. Ultimately, this meant that a project of relatively low predicted impact at a metapopulation scale could easily be judged to be unacceptable, especially given that the accuracy of the level of predicted mortality, typically through collision risk modelling, was also subject to intense debate. In this, the requirement of an avoidance rate of 98 rather than 99 coincidentally also leads to a doubling or halving of predicted losses depending on the value selected.;Table 5.1 Sustainable additional mortality thresholds (numbers of individuals) derived from potential biological removal analysis for a fictional Blacklegged Kittiwake colony of 5,000 pairs (10,000 individuals), with a range of f and CV values (0.10.5)
