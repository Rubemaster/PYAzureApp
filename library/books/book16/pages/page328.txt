There are also different types of radar antennae for different purposes. Fanbeams have a narrow horizontal and a wide vertical opening angle. They provide precise images on the horizontal distribution of target objects, but very limited altitudinal information (or vice versa when the antenna rotates vertically) (Harmata et al. 1999 Hppop et al. 2006 Kunz et al. 2007). Alternatively, a parabolic dish antenna with a scanning pencil beam (Figure 6.6) delivers steric polar coordinates, that is, images of high horizontal and vertical resolution. Separation of different species groups through characteristic wingbeat patterns, described as the target echo signature (Figure 6.6), is possible when the antenna is in a fixed position or follows the target (Bruderer 1997 Bruderer et al. 1999 2010 Bruderer  PopaLisseanu 2005 Zaugg et al. 2008 Hill et al. 2014). Information on flight altitude of birds can also be gathered by selectively sweeping different altitudinal strata with a pencil beam (Dokter et al. 2011) or tilting the rotation axis of a fanbeam antenna in 90 increments. Moreover, electromagnetic modelling techniques are emerging that can estimate three dimensional scatter properties of anisotropic objects, such as birds and bats, which may improve their taxonomic identification by radar (Mirkovic et al. 2016). Nevertheless, separation of wingbeat patterns of birds and bats is generally difficult in fixed antenna mode to impossible in radar signals during scanning mode.
