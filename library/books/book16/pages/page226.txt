Importantly, tracking data also provided a means of estimating collision risk in 2005 and 2006 when some use of the wind farm was recorded. The methods of Band et al. (2007)for less predictable bird movements recorded as timed observations were used to determine the transit rate needed as an output of stage 1 of the modelling. Stage 2 was then completed using the spreadsheet provided by Scottish Natural Heritage (2014). The data sources and treatments and outputs of each step required are outlined in Figure 4.11. An equivalent collision risk was also calculated for fledged juveniles, assuming that these accompanied their adults on foraging trips over a 30 day occupancy period (16 July15 August). The avoidance rate of Little Terns is not known, but a generic precautionary value of 98 predicted the loss of 6 adults and 0 juveniles in 2005 and 25 adults and 6 juveniles in 2006, for an annual average of 10 adults and 2 juveniles over the three years. As a result of the many uncertainties and approximations of the modelling process in particular, it is important to use such a prediction only as a rough guide to indicate the scope of collision risk. The actual extent of losses would require verification. Nevertheless, the predicted risk to Little Terns from Scroby Sands wind farm is in keeping with the observed loss of 210 birds per year (20012005 inclusive) from the Zeebrugge breeding colony of 11150 pairs as a result of collision with turbines along a breakwater between the colony and the sea (Everaert  Stienen 2007).
