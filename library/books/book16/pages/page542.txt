A major challenge for MSP lies in Europes MSP plans and the Marine Strategy Framework Directives (MSFD) (European Parliament amp European Council 2008) reference to the ecosystem approach. In essence, MSFD enhanced the terrestrial, generally freshwater, EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) (European Commission amp European Parliament 2000) and applied it to the sea. As such, it provides a list of 11 qualitative descriptors of good environmental status (Annex I WFD, European Commission amp European Parliament 2000). In 2017, Annex III of the Directive (European Commission 2017b) was amended to link ecosystem components and anthropogenic pressures and impacts with the descriptors in accordance with 2017s Decision on Good Environmental Status (European Commission 2017a). The operationalisation of the objectives may become an even more ambitious assignment than was faced when applied to WFD. At least in a mediumterm perspective, the question will no longer be limited to whether wind farms might harm the marine environment, but rather ask Does the wind farm comply with the management goals of the MSFD? MSP is already an inherently complex endeavour, considering the various environmental regulations for our seas, as Boyes amp Elliott (2016) demonstrated for the international and EU marine governance system.;Good marine environmental status focuses on pressure and impacts such as nutrient enrichment and contamination by hazardous substances that are less directly influenced by the deployment of offshore wind energy. However, Annex III also lists to some degree more OWFprone pressures and impacts, such as physical loss of habitat (i.e. the minor fractions of original habitat lost under permanent construction) and disturbances as a result of underwater noise, or biological disturbance following colonisation or exclusion. The EUs Decision on Good Environmental Status (European Commission 2017a) adds criteria and methodological standards for the monitoring and assessment of predominant pressures and impacts, as for underwater noise in descriptor 11 Member States shall establish threshold values for  the spatial distribution, temporal extent, and levels of anthropogenic impulsive
