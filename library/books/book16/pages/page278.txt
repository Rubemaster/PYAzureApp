In applying PBR to bird populations, Niel  Lebreton (2005) state that it can be used to estimate a level of mortality above which extinction is likely. In the assessment of OWFs, it is typically used to set a threshold below which any level of mortality is deemed sustainable. However, Niel  Lebreton (2005) explicitly advise against this interpretation as PBR values are derived using maximum growth rates. Furthermore, PBR makes a number of assumptions about density dependence and population trajectories that may not be supported in the populations concerned (OBrien et al. 2017). Both the shape and strength of any densitydependent relationships can determine whether a given level of mortality may be sustainable. However, in many seabird populations, such relationships are poorly understood (Horswill et al. 2017). Similarly, analyses show that in situations where populations are declining, and even in some situations where populations are stable, additional mortality at the level allowable under PBR may not be sustainable (OBrien et al. 2017). In addition, there are question marks over the need to incorporate sources of anthropogenic mortality other than that associated with wind farms, and whether ensuring a population remains sustainable meets the requirements of the European Union (EU) Birds and Habitats Directives (2009147EC and 9243EEC) (European Commission 2000 Zydelis et al. 2009 Green et al. 2016). Finally, the choice of recovery factor, which heavily influences the outcome of the models, is often highly subjective (Cook  Robinson 2015 Green et al. 2016 OBrien et al. 2017) (Box 5.2). In light of these criticisms, the UK Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies (SNCB) now advise against the use of PBR in the assessment of the populationlevel consequences of impacts from OWFs on birds.
