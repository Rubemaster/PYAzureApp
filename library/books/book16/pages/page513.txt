Moreover, the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive refers to the ecosystembased approach. Even though experts and stakeholders have not agreed upon a generally accepted definition for ecosystembased management, the concept is a core element to marine governance and thus central to the EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (Sderstrm amp Kern 2017).;A myriad of ocean policies and planning efforts have been established or continue to be underway, be they on the initiative of individual countries, such as in the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK, or catalysed by European policy and legislation (Portman et al. 2009). In the USA, coastal states bordering the Atlantic Ocean in the northeast, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oregon, Washington and California, among others, mostly refer to MSP plans as ocean management plans (Juda 2003 Boucquey et al. 2016) (see Box 9.2). In October 2017, the draft MSP plan for Washington States coast was launched (State Ocean Caucus 2017), also targeting the Pacific Ocean for MSP. The Canadian Oceans Act was published in 1997, enabling legislation to promote the integrated management of Canadas oceans. Five Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs) were established on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts under the Oceans Act (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2009).
