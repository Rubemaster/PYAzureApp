Figure 7.5 Deployment of the Integrated Monopile Installer (IHC) Noise Mitigation Screen NMS8000 at NordseeOne offshore wind farm in the North Sea in 2016. The NMS8000 stands upright on the installation vessel next to the hydraulic hammer and in front of two 6.5 m diameter monopiles. (Henk van Vessem, IHC IQIP);The Riffgat OWF demonstrated the first serial application of the technology in 2012. A total of 30 monopile foundations were first vibrated into the seabed and then driven to target depth by impact piledriving shielded by an NMS6900 system. The casing had a length of 30 m, an outer diameter of 10 m and a weight of 360 t. Noise measurements carried out at 750 m for five piling events revealed an SEL (singlestrike, 50 percentile) of 163 dB re 1 Pa2 s (Fischer et al. 2013). The project clearly demonstrated that the noise could be kept below the statutory thresholds, but as a result of the lack of reference measurements, the extent of the achieved noise reduction remained unclear. In 2014, the NMS6900 was used for another 80 piledriving operations at the Borkum Riffgrund 1
