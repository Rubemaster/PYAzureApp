Figure 7.10 Two Mono Bucket foundations on board an installation vessel in February 2013. The foundations served as substructures for meteorological met masts installed at Dogger Bank in the North Sea. (Kristian Ascanius Jacobsen, Universal Foundation AS);To close existing knowledge gaps, in particular with regard to the penetration ability of suction buckets in layered and relatively hard soils, the Carbon Trust initiated a trial installation campaign at different projected windfarm sites in the North Sea (Nielsen  Ibsen 2015). Further practical experience was gained when a full scale suction bucket jacket prototype carrying a 4.0 MW wind turbine was installed at Borkum Riffgrund 1 wind farm in August 2014 (DONG 2013 Carbon Trust 2014) in a water depth of 24.4 m (Figure 7.11). During the installation process, an SPL (averaged over 5 seconds 5 percentile) of 138141 dB re 1Pa and an Lp,0pk of 149166 dB re 1Pa were measured at a distance of 750 m (Remmers  Bellmann 2015, unpublished). It is of note that the ship propeller noise dominated the sound recordings and that the operation of the suction pumps could not be identified against this background.
