OWFs, most involve the use of matrix models to derive population projections (Figure 5.5) (WWT Consulting 2011 2012 Humphreys et al. 2016 Cook  Robinson 2017). At their most basic level, these models may be deterministic, with fixed values for all parameters. However, additional complexity can be incorporated, for example demographic andor environmental stochasticity and density dependent regulation of demographic parameters.;Figure 5.5 An example of a Leslie matrix model that may be used to elucidate population effects in windfarm assessment. P1 reflects productivity of breeding adults, S1 is first year survival, S2 is subadult survival, SAD is adult survival, N1 is number of first years, N2 number of second years and Nad number of adult birds.;These approaches have been widely used in the assessment of the populationlevel consequences of collisions between seabirds and turbines (Cook  Robinson 2015). The widespread use of these approaches led to the development of industrywide guidance as part of the Strategic Ornithological Support Services (SOSS) process (WWT Consulting 2011 2012), which used the Northern Gannet Morus bassanus in the North Sea as a case study. This guidance highlighted the need for a clear understanding of limitations of the data available for the population concerned. It also argues that, in cases where data are limited, simpler models may reflect a more honest assessment of the population concerned than more complex ones. In particular, it is argued that density dependence should only be incorporated into models where there is clear evidence for it in the population concerned. This advice is echoed by Green et al.
