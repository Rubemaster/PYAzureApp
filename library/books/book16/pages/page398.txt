Figure 7.4 Use of a double big bubble curtain in combination with a hydro sound damper system around the pile during installation of one of the turbine foundations at Wikinger offshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea in 2016. (Hydrotechnik Lbeck GmbH);Casings are especially well suited to install monopiles. Design concepts for casings range from flexible pile sleeves made of different fabrics to hollow steel tubes. The most widely used application is the Noise Mitigation Screen (NMS), which was developed and designed by the Dutch company IHC (Figure 7.5). The NMS is a doublewalled steel cylinder with soundinsulated connections between the inner and outer walls and an airfilled cavity. A confined bubble curtain creates an airwater environment inside the cylinder to reduce the sound coupling. This system is also known as the Integrated Monopile Installer.
