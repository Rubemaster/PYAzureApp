One difference between the onshore and offshore versions of the Band model is that the data available to parameterise or input into the model are collected using different methods. The Band model can essentially be broken down into two parts (1) the probability of a single bird colliding with the turbine rotor during a single passage, and (2) a calculation of the number of birds flying through the rotor and thus the expected number of collisions, after accounting for any avoidance behaviour. When calculating the probability of a single bird colliding with the rotor, the models for onshore and offshore are similar except for the fact that the height of the rotor will change relative to the sea level over a tidal cycle for turbines fixed to the seabed (rather than floating), which is factored into the model. When considering the number of birds flying through the rotor, the datacollection methods differ.;For the original Band model, estimates of the number of birds flying through the rotorswept area were dependent on whether the birds were making predictable or less predictable movements, for example migration versus foraging. For the predictable movements, the mean number of birds per hour of observation to fly through the risk window was determined. For less predictable movements, vantagepoint surveys were used to estimate bird activity in an area. For offshore environments, the methods are more similar to the predictable movement methods for onshore and generally are calculated from atsea surveys, and assume a constant flux of birds through the area derived from a measure of density and a known flight speed of the bird species concerned that is, predictable movements. While updating the Band model for the offshore environment, other elements of the model were modified including the inclusion of flight height distribution data. There are uncertainties associated with all CRMs however, those used in the offshore environment have the challenge that it is difficult to collect empirical mortality data, meaning that model validation is difficult.
