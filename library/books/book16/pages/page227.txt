Figure 4.11 Details of the collision modelling process following Band et al. (2007) for Little Tern tracked from North Denes in 2005 and 2006, when birds entered the Scroby Sands wind farm. In 2004, no recorded use meant no collisions were predicted.;Finally, it is important to note that in 2013 Natural England (unpublished report) commissioned further boatbased surveys to estimate density of Little Terns within and immediately around the wind farm. Application of the standard Band (2012) collision risk model on all data estimated 3 collisions per annum at 98 avoidance although no Little Terns were actually recorded in the wind farm itself. Moreover, a more typical avoidance rate now applied to seabirds (98.999.8 from Cook et al. 2018 and 99.699.9 from Skov et al. 2018 as derived from a variety of gulls and Northern Gannet Morus bassanus in both cases) suggests that the collision rate of Little Terns would likely be 1 bird per annum. It was therefore concluded that collision is of negligible threat to the local Little Tern population, some of which now breed on Scroby Sands themselves (see Perrow 2019).
