The first publication using vocalisation to quantify bird migration dates back about 120 years (see Evans 2005 for reviews on the history of acoustic bird research Farnsworth 2005). The advent of digital recorders has since accelerated the science of bioacoustics by enabling development of analytical software that visualises acoustic signals, and allows collection of vast quantities of date and timestamped data. More recently, the combination of decreasing equipment costs and the increased power of analytical software has spurred deployments of multiple biomicrophones in arrays (Blumstein et al. 2011 Mennhill 2011 Stepanian et al. 2016a).;The use of spatially dispersed groups of microphones also makes it possible to monitor soundscapes by which individual birds can be tracked in space and time (Kirschel et al. 2011), yielding data of generally similar, or even enhanced, quality compared to that obtained from observerbased studies (Mennhill 2011 see Visual observations and optical devices,above). Farnsworth  Russell (2007), for instance, used a microphone array to monitor flight calls of migratory birds around an offshore oil platform in an area covering 6001,000 m. Other acoustic bird migration monitoring studies have also been successfully conducted offshore (Hppop et al. 2006 2012 Hppop  Hilgerloh 2012 Hill et al. 2014), with the longest record of offshore bird flight calls collected on the FINO 1 platform near the Alpha Ventus wind farm in the German part of the North Sea (Hppop et al. 2012 2019 Hill et al. 2014). The main advantages of acoustic bird monitoring are the continuous quantification of speciesspecific calls and the ability to synchronise call activity with location, temporal (i.e. seasonal and diurnal nocturnal) and weatherdependent variables. The accuracy of this method has also been corroborated through radarbased measurements (Farnsworth et al. 2004). With respect to OWFs, flight call quantification can provide evidence of bird presence in the rotorswept zone (Hppop  Hilgerloh 2012 Hill et al. 2014) and, thus, is expected to improve speciesspecific estimates of bird collision risk.
