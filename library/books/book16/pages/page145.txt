Linetransect methods do not fit well for flying birds recorded in snapshots by the ESAS method, partly because of the difficulty of estimating the distance to flying birds. For example, the Heinemann (1981) method cannot easily be applied to flying birds at variable distances from the water surface and is too slow for use in moderate or higher bird density. The use of rangefinders at sea shows promise however (Borkenhagen et al. 2018 Harwood et al. 2018), but will also be slow and difficult to use at moderate or high bird density. Moreover, it is difficult to account for responsive movement of seabirds to the survey platform, which may take place at severalkilometres beyond the visual range of humans (Skov  Durinck 2001 Hyrenbach et al. 2007). Nevertheless, flying birds that show no obvious response to the vessel and that are assigned to radial distance bands over 180 during snapshots (and not perpendicular distance bands), essentially as point samples, may allow correction for detection efficiency (Box 3.4).;Richard J. Berridge, Martin R. Perrow  Andrew J. P. Harwood;To standardise boatbased surveys for use in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of wind farms, Camphuysen et al. (2004) recommended the basic European Seabirds at Sea (ESAS) method (Tasker et al. 1984 Webb  Durinck 1992). To negate the bias introduced by the movement of flying birds relative to the survey vessel, instantaneous snapshots along the line transect are conducted to allow density estimates of flying birds to be calculated. The method assumes that all birds are visible for the full transect width, with snapshot counts conducted in continuous abutting 300300 m boxes (Figure 3.7).
