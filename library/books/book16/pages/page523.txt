Figure 9.3 A flock of Common Scoter Melanitta nigra, a species sensitive to disturbance from inshore wind farms, especially in relation to vessels and human presence, that became important in early consideration of windfarm impacts in the UK, particularly in Liverpool Bay. (Martin Perrow);Thus, the strategic character of early SEA for the siting of OWF in English and Welsh waters was limited, particularly as its sole focus was on a few strategic regions, which were considered suitable for developing OWF. In other words, there was no systematic scrutiny of other regions as SEA was not conducted for the complete territorial and EEZ seascape. The assessment of alternatives was also limited to mere OWF development scenarios in relation to potential installed capacity and, critically, the SEA also adopted the approach of leaving any issues to be resolved at the sitebased project EIA.;Taking on these experiences, siting decisions for Round 3 were made in two stages. The first of these was macrositing, whereby national or strategic selection of suitable seabed areas around the UK was conducted by Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Crown Estate. A first Offshore Energy SEA was completed by DECC in 2009, followed by a second in 2011 and a third in 2016, with the conclusion that at a strategic level there
