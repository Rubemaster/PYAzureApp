MSP in Germanys EEZ had been an ambitious policy to develop offshore wind power, to serve the iconic Energiewende (Portman et al. 2009). Rehhausen et al. (2018) scrutinised the relevant SEA according to a set of criteria for sound SEA making (Table 9.1). While Germany was pioneering at the time in the early setting up of the MSP plan (Figure 9.5), some weaknesses were identified as well the public was not involved in the scoping processes, and likely environmental consequences were displayed only for the preferred alternative, arguing that no other reasonable alternatives existed. The cumulative effects assessment remained limited to intraplan effects, whereas at least statelevel plans for the territorial sea could have been considered. The monitoring concept known as StUK 3, which was the standard investigation concept for impacts pertaining to OWFs until 2013 (BSH 2007), focused primarily on existing environmental monitoring and research on the effects of OWFs since 2013, following BSH amp BMU (2014) StUK 4 has replaced StUK 3 as the standard investigation concept for impacts pertaining to OWFs. The agency created a database to handle environmental monitoring information related to the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. However, it remains to be seen how effectively and transparently these data will be available for the amendment process of the German EEZ MSP 20192021.;SEA began with the scoping process in 2005, when first meetings with stakeholders were set to start the planning process. Planning and SEA process ended in 2009.
