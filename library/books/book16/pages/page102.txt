Figure 2.12 Aerial surveys recording a series of digital still images were used to determine the effects of the construction and operation of Scroby Sands wind farm on seals using the haulout on the main Scroby Sands sandbank, around 2 km from the wind farm (Skeate et al. 2012). (Air Images Ltd);Longterm studies have provided indepth data on population sizes (e.g. Reijnders et al. 1997 Teilmann et al. 2010) that provide baselines that incorporate natural variation. However, it is challenging to link changes in a local seal population in terms of abundance, habitat use, reproductive success or population growth directly to developments of wind farms, or indeed any other anthropogenic activity. Nonetheless, longterm estimates of regional population size and vital parameters, in combination with data from telemetry studies, have been used to model the expected impact of windfarm construction on Harbour Seals (Thompson et al. 2013). In areas where haulout locations are close to windfarm developments, direct effects on seal colonies have also been recorded. For example, the reduction in Harbour Seal numbers at Scroby Sands was most likely due to construction noise (Skeate et al. 2012) (Figure 2.12). During the piledriving activities in the Nysted OWF in the Baltic Sea, a reduction in seals resting on land
