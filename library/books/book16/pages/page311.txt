This chapter collates the scope and limitations of technology and methods to quantify the density, identity, flight height and behaviour of bats and birds in the offshore environment, including both seabirds and migratory landbirds such as passerines and waterfowl. Such information is needed because offshore windfarm development has reached the industrial stage in European waters and is now rapidly increasing in many countries around the world such as in Southeast Asia and the USA. Development poses direct and indirect threats to wildlife, particularly in a cumulative context. Many aspects of animalturbine interactions appear to be site, season and species specific, so that uncertainties about the magnitude of threats and potential impacts remain. Quantification of bat and bird activity and riskassociated behaviour is especially challenging in the offshore environment for practical reasons, such as technical constraints on measurements (e.g. wave impact on acoustic and radar detection) as well as for reasons of remoteness and limited accessibility, thus demanding the use of elaborate remotesensing techniques rather than observerbased visual observations. The practicability of a range of methods and techniques to achieve these aims is introduced and described, with
