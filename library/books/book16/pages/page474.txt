Temporary shutdown of turbines has been used successfully at some onshore wind farms as a means to prevent collisions ofbirds with turbine blades, with low production losses (e.g. Tom et al. 2017a) (Table 8.2). Shutdown can be performed automatically, triggered by information retrieved by cameras or radar, or manually that is, on demand by visual observers with or without the aid of radar. So far, this measure has mainly been applied for migratory soaring birds, including raptors, storks, pelicans and cranes (Figure 8.9).
