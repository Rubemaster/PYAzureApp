Figure 8.1 Migratory bats known to routinely cross large bodies of open water on migration in the USA include (a) Eastern Red Bat Lasiurus borealis (Hatch et al. 2013) and (b) Silverhaired Bat Lasionycteris noctivagans (see McGuire et al. 2012). Note the Silver haired Bat has been fitted with a MOTUS tag (see Molis et al., Chapter 6). (Sherri and Brock Fenton);However, very little is known about the potential impacts of OWFs on bats. As with onshore wind farms, while offshore turbines may represent a significant collision risk, they are thought unlikely to cause displacement or disturbance of bats. Thus, the range of possible mitigation measures at onshore sites (Arnett 2017) seem likely to be applicable to offshore projects (see also Wilson et al. 2010). Many of the measures discussed in relation to birds in this chapter may therefore also be
