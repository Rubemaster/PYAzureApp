Investigating the distribution and abundance of what are usually relatively small populations in a vast oceanic habitat has multiple challenges. The environment itself may only be accessible during certain seasonal periods and sudden poor weather intervals can delay or disrupt the best planned surveys. In addition, the species of interest may be widely dispersed and the ability to detect animals may be comprised by inclement weather conditions, the competence of the observers, the proficiency of recording equipment and, of course, the behaviour of the individual animals themselves.;Multiple techniques can be successfully employed in a variety of different marine mammal habitats that provide an understanding of distribution and habitat use however, some general principles should be applied to all wildlife surveys. First, the data collected should be typical or representative of the habitat or population that is being surveyed and, where necessary, should be independent, so as to reduce biases. In addition, all data must be collected with the utmost accuracy possible and in accordance with the requirements of the technique being used. Detailed reviews on the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods, also with respect to windfarm projects, can be found in a number of publications, such as Hammond (2002), Evans  Hammond (2004), Evans (2008) and Verfu et al. (2015).;One of the most widely used techniques for estimating animal density or abundance is distance sampling. The analysis is so called as it relies on knowing the recorded distance from the animal or cue, such as a group of dolphins, to a survey line or survey point (Buckland et al. 1993 2001 2004 Thomas et al. 2010). Data on marine mammals for distance sampling are commonly collected from visual and acoustic linetransect or pointtransect surveys (e.g. Hammond et al. 2002 Southwell 2005 Kaschner et al. 2012 Marques et al. 2013 Bortolotto et al. 2017).
