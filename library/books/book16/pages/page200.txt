During the breeding season, most bird species are centralplace foragers (Orians  Pearson 1979), meaning that they are constrained to repeatedly return to a central place, that is, the nest site. The mystery of how far birds travel to find food within a foraging range and the habitat they use away from the colony during breeding has long fascinated ornithologists. Early studies on foraging range of marine birds focused on indirect methods, such as visually following individuals, observing distances where birds were noticed carrying food (e.g. Bradstreet  Brown 1985) or recording the time elapsed between successive nestsite visits, to estimate potential straightline distance travelled using a constant mean flight speed (e.g. Corkhill 1973). The development of telemetry methods (Box 4.1), however, has enabled more accurate estimations of foraging range to be estimated for populations of marine birds.;Tracking individuals of a particular species from a breeding colony can directly determine linkages between a wind farm and the colony, broadly termed connectivity, which can then be used to partition potential effects to these populations within the impact assessment process. This has proved to be of particular interest in determining potential impacts upon protected sites, such as SPAs in Europe within a stringent HRA process (see Introduction, above). An important first step in assessment has often been to use a generic foraging range derived from a number of studies (e.g. Thaxter et al. 2012) to provide a speciesspecific representative estimate (e.g. RWE 2011 ERM 2012 Natural Power 2012 SMartWind 2013 Forewind 2014). The use of generic foraging range data occurs mainly in two stages (1) a scoping phase, whereby protected sites and species potentially impacted by the effects associated with a
