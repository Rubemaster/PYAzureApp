Cormorant Phalocrocarax carbo, reducing the numbers at roosts by a minimum of 90 after one to three evenings. Cook et al. (2011) also note that the use of flashing lights could initiate reduced use by birds and a prospective 5070 decrease in collision risk.;Finally, the use of microwave signals, magnets or electromagnetic waves has also been discussed for birds, but the possible risks to humans and other wildlife has generally precluded further application (Harris  Davis 1998 Gartman et al. 2016b).;Increasing the visibility of turbines, particularly the blades, to birds could reduce the potential for collision (see Johnson et al. 2007 for a review May et al. 2017). For example, Curry  Kerlinger (2000) suggested that painting turbine blades with highcontrast and ultraviolet (UV) paint might influence flight behaviour around wind turbines. In contrast, Young et al. (2003) found that the use of UV light reflective paint was not particularly successful in reducing collisions. The success of ultraviolet paint in particular is likely to be species or at least group specific, as different groups of birds such as gulls relative to other seabirds have different sensitivities in different parts of the UV spectrum (May 2017). Although the idea of painting turbine blades to make them more visible to birds had previously been attempted (Johnson et al. 2007), Hodos (2003) was possibly the first to do so with the specific idea of combating motion smear, whereby the brain is unable to process fast moving objects (Box 8.3). The idea is that a contrast in colour breaks up the image seen by the bird, thus making the blades more readily identifiable. Painting one turbine blade black appears to be effective, as confirmed by the study at Smla in Norway (Box 8.3).
