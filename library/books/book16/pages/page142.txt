Models are fitted using various key functions (uniform, half normal, hazard rate or negative exponential), with or without adjustment terms (e.g. cosine, simple polynomial or hermitepolynomial). Model selection is based on evaluation of the shape of the detection functions, Akaike information criterion values and chisquared test results for grouped data and coefficients of variation. Density and population estimates and associated confidence intervals can then be derived for the desired surveystudy area component. For further details of the application of Distance analysis, see Buckland et al. (2001 2004).;Figure 3.5 illustrates the difference between fitted detection functions for Northern Gannet Morus bassanus (n258 observations) and Common Guillemot Uria aalge (n1,654 observations) on the water, using boatbased linetransect survey data from the survey of one windfarm site in the UK North Sea. There is no dropoff in detectability (overall probability of detection of 1) for Northern Gannet, a large bodied (94 cm in length and 3 kg BTO 2018) and conspicuous species, while the much smaller Common Guillemot (40 cm in length and 690 g BTO 2018) had an overall probability of detection of 0.48, and applying the correction would more than double the density estimate.;Figure 3.5 Examples of fitted detection functions from distance analysis for (a) Northern Gannet Morus bassanus and (b) Common Guillemot Uria aalge on the water derived from boatbased line transect surveys at one wind farm in the UK North Sea.
