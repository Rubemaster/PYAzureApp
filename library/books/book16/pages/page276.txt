Figure 5.4 The highly colonial Blacklegged Kittiwake Rissa tridacytla a key subject of potential biological removal analysis during impact assessment in the UK. (Martin Perrow);During the process, NE sought the advice of Peter Dillingham to gain a greater understanding of the outputs in order to conclude whether the simple model was suitable for decisions regarding key protected populations at colonies. Subsequently, the Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies (SNCBs) used PBR to inform their responses to offshore wind farm applications in tandem with its use by developers and their consultants at numerous sites such as Burbo Bank Extension (NIRAS Consulting 2013), Project One of Hornsea (SMartWind LtdRPS 2013) and Seagreen Alpha and Bravo (Seagreen 2013 2017).;The appeal of PBR as an assessment tool was largely a result of its simplicity. The data required, in the form of survival rates, age of first breeding and population size, were generally readily available from the literature and published colony censuses, which could be quickly agreed upon between the developers and the SNCBs. However, reaching agreement on the coefficient of variation (CV) around the population (reflective of the accuracy of the population estimate and the reproductive biology of the species concerned), and especially the recovery factor (f), often proved to be more difficult, as the SNCBs required greater levels of precaution.;The values of CV and f are highly influential in the output of the model. Initially, f was suggested to represent the conservation status of the species. To this end, Dillingham  Fletcher (2008) utilised the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) criteria, with values of 0.5 for least concern species, 0.3 for near threatened and 0.1 for threatened species. Blacklegged Kittiwake is a clear example of how this can be open to interpretation. As the worlds most numerous gull species (Coulson 2011), a value of 0.5 may be applicable, although the species rapid decline in the UK (JNCC 2015) could imply a value 0.3 in a national or local context. However, the SNCBs advised a very precautionary approach to f (and CV), and opted
