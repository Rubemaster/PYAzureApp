The construction, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind farms involve activities that generate underwater sound. Most concern has been raised about the impacts of noise during construction using impact piledriving. Piledriving noise can lead to displacement of marine mammals and some marine fish species. Physiological effects such as temporary hearing loss are likely if the acoustic dose at the receiver exceeds certain thresholds. In this chapter, the methods to mitigate sound during offshore windfarm construction are divided into three categories (1) source mitigation, comprising methods that reduce the sound directly at the source (2) channel mitigation, comprising methods that reduce the emitted underwater sound in the water column and (3) receiver mitigation, comprising methods that prevent the receiver from being close to the sound source. Both source and channelmitigation methods are confounded by the need to achieve a certain amount of hammer energy to penetrate the seabed. Source mitigation can involve adjustment of piling energy, pulse prolongation and use of alternative installation technologies such as vibrodriving, BLUE Piling or suction buckets. Channel mitigation involves bubble curtains, casings and resonators including hydrosound dampers. Bubble curtains and casings have proven to be very effective during piling. However, as they dampen higher frequencies more
