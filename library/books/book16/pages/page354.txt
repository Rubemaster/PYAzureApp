The intention of the MUlti SEnsor wildlife detection system (MUSE), formerly known as the Thermal  Visual Animal Detection System (TVADS) (Skov  Jensen 2015), is to generate a comprehensive estimate of bird and bat collision and avoidance behaviour at OWFsfrom the scale of individual wind turbines to multiple wind farms (Skov  Jensen 2015). MUSE combines horizontal surveillance and vertical radar with pantilt digital cameras in visual and thermal modes (see Figure 6.10 in Box 6.4) for optimal spatial and temporal coverage. The system is designed to deliver speciesspecific information about collision events, flight altitude and three dimensional flight tracks both day and night to continuously depict lateral and vertical movements of birds and bats approaching wind turbines. This system enables users to quantify speciesspecific avoidance rates of larger birds, such as gulls and Northern Gannet, to improve the data basis of CRMs. MUSE has been tested under operational conditions at Thanet OWF in the UK (Box 6.4) (Skov et al. 2018) and is being used in the Block Island OWF in the USA.;Compliance with regulatory requirements increasingly demands clear evidence on how birds behave within and around offshore wind farms (OWFs). To quantify bird collision risk, collision risk models are used, and to obtain realistic risk estimates, the collision risk modelling is subsequently corrected to take account of behavioural responses of birds to the presence of turbines that is, avoidance. However, there is considerable uncertainty over the avoidance rates of most groups of birds owing to the relatively few monitoring studies so far undertaken in OWFs that have gathered empirical evidence. To meet the demand for further robust evidence on the avoidance behaviour of seabirds to OWFs, the Offshore Renewables Joint Industry Programme (ORJIP) Bird Collision Avoidance (BCA) Study coordinated by the Carbon Trust, UK, was undertaken at the Thanet OWF in the UK, developed and managed by Vattenfall, between July 2014 and June 2016
