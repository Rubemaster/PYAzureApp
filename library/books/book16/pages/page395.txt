Figure 7.3 BLUE 25M Hammer hooked up to an installation vessel Svanen, driving a 6.5 m diameter monopile during a fullscale test campaign off the coast of the Netherlands in August 2018. (Jasper Winkes, Fistuca BV);Channel mitigation, whereby the sound emitted into the water column is reduced, is achieved by applying noise reduction technologies (NRTs). Any NRT involves placing a sounddampening obstacle between the pile and the water body. The obstacle can either be air or any other soundabsorbing, reflecting or shielding material. The development of NRTs was mainly triggered by the implementation of threshold criteria for underwater noise in Germany (BMU 2013 BSH 2013b). A variety of methods and technical solutions have since been developed, tested and qualified for the offshore wind sector. An extensive overview on NRTs is provided in OSPAR (2016). The most relevant technologies to date are bubble curtains, pile casings and modular systems consisting of resonators such as hydrosound dampers (HSDs). All of these have proven their effectiveness during hundreds of pile installations (Table 7.1) and are commercially available. Detailed information for the OWF projects that are discussed in this chapter are provided in Table 7.2. Based on existing experience, NRT can be regarded as a
