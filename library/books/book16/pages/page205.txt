The study was conducted at Orford Ness, part of the Alde Ore Estuary Special Protection Area on the Suffolk coast, at a declining colony of 550640 actual occupied territories. A total of 25 birds (11 in 2010 and 14 in 2011) were captured at the nest during incubation using a walkin cage trap, and a GPS tag (Bouten et al. 2013) weighing 19 g was attached using a wing harness (see Thaxter et al. 2015 for more information) (Figure 4.4). Data from the GPS tags of 24 birds were downloadedremotely to a base station and processed one tag did not produce any data.;Figure 4.4 Photographs showing attachment of GPS tags to Lesser Blackbacked Gulls Larus fuscus before (left Chris Thaxter) and after release (right Dave Crawshaw).;During the breeding season, most birds (up to 80 in a given year) showed connectivity with the proposed East Anglia OWF zone, located approximately 40 km offshore from Orford Ness, while they were associated with their breeding colony (ca. March to August). Some individuals also showed connectivity with smaller consented and operational sites in the Thames estuary. However, the proportion of time that birds spent in all proposed, consented and operational OWF areas was quite small, ranging from 5 in 2010 to 1 in 2012. Using kernel density estimation, spatial overlaps of the 95 contour with OWF areas were highest in 2010 (up to 6) and lowest in 2012 (1) (Figure 4.5) (Thaxter et al. 2014 2015). General additive mixedeffects models were then used to analyse time budgets and spatial overlaps with OWFs in 5 day time slices across the breeding period, which revealed significant seasonal patterns, with overlaps restricted to the early chickrearing period. A mean peak overlap of 36 in time budgets was observed during the 28 June2 July timesection in 2010 (Thaxter et al. 2015). Compared to females, males also spent twice as much time in windfarm areas. Consequently, both interannual and withinbreeding season exposure was highly variable.
