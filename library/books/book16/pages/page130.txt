EIAs rely on an evaluation of the presence of environmental receptors, such as seabirds, that may be exposed to the pressures of a given project such as the construction and operation of an OWF. This tends to require rather large survey areas, as seabird distribution, especially of pelagic feeding species, varies strongly in relation to a range of factors including hydrographic and meteorological factors. Camphuysen et al. (2014), for example, recommended that a study area of six times the area of the project site should be used for a characterisation study. An example of the scale of the surveys that were required for the large Round 3 Zones of development in the UK, each of which was to support several windfarm sites, is provided in Box 3.1. Furthermore, as seabirds may respond to OWFs at substantial distances of even more than 10 km (e.g. Mendel et al. 2019), baseline studies must not focus on the wind farm itself but cover a large surrounding area. To cope with fluctuating seabird numbers within a defined area, a high frequency of surveys has also generally been requested by the statutory agencies. However, while careful planning should ensure that survey programmes are completed, this has not always been possible as a result of the limited availability of suitable weather conditions (Box 3.1). For German OWF studies, the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Society of Germany (BSH) has drafted a Standard for Environmental Impact Assessments (StUK), which intends to balance the information needs to consent OWFs within ambitious targets for expanding renewable energy generation with the capabilities of different methods (BSH 2013). Although other countries have not fixed such detailed standards for their offshore industries, many (but by no means all) approaches are similar and methods usually follow international standards, as outlined in Camphuysen et al. (2004).
