Because a large number of aerial observer surveys have already been conducted to inform offshore windfarm planning processes, it is of great interest to compare the results with new digital techniques. A direct comparison using fully matching double surveys is not possible because, owing to different demands on flight height, observers and cameras cannot be placed in the same plane. Wei et al. (2016) made the first comparison of an observer survey, followed about 30 minutes later by a digital video survey using the HiDef system, in the German Bight, north of the island of Helgoland. Sighting rates for all species were two to four times higher for the digital video technique and differences were especially striking for Common Scoter Melanitta nigra (Figure 3.11). On an effective transect length of 324 km, 2,203 scoters were counted by observers, whereas 15,341 scoters were later detected on the video footage. Both methods provided largely similar distributions of scoter in the survey area, but calculated densities were about 50 higher for the digital video method (Figure 3.12). The large difference between methods is probably caused by the disturbance of Common Scoter by the lowflying observer plane, which usually flushes most Common Scoters onapproach. The footage of the digital videos, which were acquired from a height of about 550 m (1,800 feet), did not indicate any response to the plane.;Figure 3.11 Relationships between the density of Common Scoter Melanitta nigra in six synchronous aerial observer and digital video surveys carried out on 2 December 2013 (N  17,544) (a) point estimates of density with regression line and 95 confidence limits compared to parity between two methods and (b) mean density of scoters recorded using the two methods.
