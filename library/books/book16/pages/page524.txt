Taking on these experiences, siting decisions for Round 3 were made in two stages. The first of these was macrositing, whereby national or strategic selection of suitable seabed areas around the UK was conducted by Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Crown Estate. A first Offshore Energy SEA was completed by DECC in 2009, followed by a second in 2011 and a third in 2016, with the conclusion that at a strategic level therewere no overriding environmental considerations to prevent achievement of deployment of up to 33 GW of offshore wind (DECC 2009). In the second stage, the Crown Estate identified nine Round 3 zones, two within the Scottish EEZ and seven in England and Wales, comprising four within the EEZs of these countries and three within English territorial waters. In a separate zoning and project planning process, offshore wind developers, who were awarded Zone Development Agreements, held the right to locate OWFs within Round 3 zones, in principle with the flexibility of avoiding any particular limiting factors, including environmental issues such as important seabird foraging areas. Individual projects then required EIA, and, if necessary, Appropriate Assessments under the EU Habitats Directive (European Council 1992) in relation to European protected species or habitats, or under the EU Birds Directive (European Parliament amp European Council 2009) in relation to Special Protection Areas for birds, which at that point were mostly seabird colonies connected as a result of breeding birds from specific colonies using proposed windfarm areas.;It was, however, other considerations that ultimately meant that three of nine zones did not progress to development (Figure 9.4). Atlantic Array was abandoned as a result of challenging seabed conditions, water depth and difficult currents (Wind Power Offshore 2013). Challenging ground conditions were similarly cited as making the Irish Sea zone economically unviable (Wind Power Offshore 2014). The Navitus Bay site planned in the West Isle of Wight zone was refused planning permission in September 2015 owing to the visual impact the development would have on the region, including the Jurassic Coast UNESCO World Heritage Site (Wind Power Offshore 2015).
