14 in 201415) with 50 g GPSGSM tags, attached using neck collars, to determine potential impacts of OWFs between south east England and the Netherlands in relation to the movements of swans migrating to and from UK protected sites, including the Ouse Washes SPA, which holds up to 33 of the northwest European population in midwinter. Birds crossed a total of 52 windfarm footprints, including 11 operational sites and many European North Sea windfarm zones, with the greatest interaction seen for the consented East Anglia ONE zone in UK waters. Several birds migrated to the SchleswigHolstein area in Germany, also bringing them into overlap with sites in the German Bight. Flight altitude data were also collected for five birds, revealing that 93 of offshore flights were 150 m, with most (mean and median) less than 50 m, potentially below the vertical rotorswept zone of rotors. Given the number of wind farm areas crossed within and outside the UK, this telemetry study highlights the need for careful cumulative assessment of potential impacts on migrating species (see Griffin et al. 2016 for more information).;Studies also need to be extended to juvenile and immature individuals simply because, as shown through some telemetry studies, the movements of these groups may be quite different from those of adults. For example, the migration routes of Scopolis Shearwater Calonectris diomedea differ among adults, immatures and juveniles (Pron  Grmillet 2013). In addition, Votier et al. (2017) showed the foraging site fidelity of Northern Gannets fitted with GPSGlobal System for Mobile Communications (GSM) tags varied across different age classes, including immature birds. Although the challenges of tracking birds in these periods can be substantial, the opportunity nonetheless exists to investigate windfarm interactions across different ontogenetic phases.
