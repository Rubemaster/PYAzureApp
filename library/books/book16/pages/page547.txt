OWF areas. Yates et al. (2015) propose a mitigation strategy for minimising the total cost of planning solutions by facilitating and maximising colocation opportunities between compatible uses that are competing for space. Often, OWFs become exclusion zones for fishing, especially in relation to trawling where there are safety issues of snagging windfarm infrastructure, among others yet Dutch approaches explore colocation options (Jansen et al. 2016). Dutch multiuse debates have emphasised colocation of either bivalve or seaweed production within OWFs, with Blue Mussel Mytilus edulis cultivation in Dutch waters appearing to be the most feasible option from a commercial perspective (KitePowell 2017).;Jansen et al. (2016) also explore the potential risks and synergies of colocation of aquaculture and other marine offshore activities in the Dutch North Sea in terms of ecological, economic and governance aspects. Besides calling for pilot projects with mussel cultures, Jansen et al. (2016) argue for the development of remote management and monitoring systems to obtain data and monitor culture performance without in situ visits, which would otherwise be time consuming and expensive. In the UK, Christie et al. (2014) propose an adaptive management approach for assessing colocation options for offshore renewable energy, particularly within MPAs and with aquaculture projects.;Thus, even OWFs and MPAs do not necessarily represent opposing spatial uses (Ashley et al. 2018) (see Box 9.3). Christie et al. (2014) argue that a deploy and monitor process based on pilot projects can determine whether colocation is practicable. Effectively, the question is whether and how MSP can assist in overcoming potential tradeoffs, for example, by fostering both socioeconomic and ecological goals and thus facilitating the co evolution of Sustainable Development Goals.
