(Sharples et al. 2012). This makes it challenging to obtain sufficient data to make generalised conclusions. Also, marine mammal populations rarely occur in any number in close vicinity to wind farm development sites, so individuals are less likely to use a specific site on a regular basis and tagged animals may not even occur close to a wind farm during the construction phase. What has been very relevant to windfarm development, however, is that the information obtained from tagged marine mammals can form the basis of larger scale models on habitat selection (e.g. Aarts et al. 2008 2016a). These models both assist in our understanding of how animals occur naturally and can also predict how anthropogenic activities may impact them.;Abundance and habitat use of different seal species can be estimated by regularly monitoring their haulout habitats. Counts of colonies can be made directly from land or sea (e.g. Burn et al. 2006) however, it is more common to use aerial photographs of haulout sites (Figure 2.12). Counts are made during specific times of the seals life cycle, such as moulting or weaning, ideally when the highest and most stable numbers of seals are present (Thompson et al. 2005). Data from pup counts, for example, can be scaled up to estimate total population size using various statistical models (e.g. SCOS 2016).
