This planningrelated chapter provides a review of approximately a decades work on spatial planning approaches for marine ecosystems and seascapes, and relevant Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs). Attention is focused first on the initial motives and early pioneers of this young planning realm, recognising offshore wind farms (OWFs) as a crucial driver of marine spatial planning (MSP). Early approaches to MSP faced major challenges a limited and rather dynamic marine database for planning purposes, with lessons of various marine uses still to be learned, especially considering actual impacts pertaining to OWFs. This chapter offers insights into pioneering MSP, primarily in the UK and Germany. The year 2021 marks the deadline for European member states to set up Marine Spatial Plans in accordance with the 2014 Maritime Spatial Planning Directive. In conjunction with the 2008 European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive, this is to adopt an ambitious ecosystembased management approach, both raising and addressing the question as to what degree this will modify future MSP and how SEA is conducted in relation to OWFs. In addition, challenges remain in preventing, assessing and mitigating intra and interplan cumulative effects on the marine environment and tailoring impact assessment approaches accordingly, be they for
