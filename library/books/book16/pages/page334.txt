Bat detector systems have been used to study bat activity and migration in onshore (Ahln 1997 Ahln et al. 2009) and offshore environments (Walter et al. 2007 Ahln et al. 2009 Pelletier et al. 2013 Peterson 2016) (Box 6.1). Automated recording devices areespecially useful along coastlines, islands (Cryan  Brown 2007 Bach et al. 2009 Rydell et al. 2014) and offshore (Ahln et al. 2009 Hppop  Hill 2016), and have been regularly and successfully used to specifically monitor bat activity at both onshore (Kunz et al. 2007 Brinkmann et al. 2011 Pelletier et al. 2013 Rodrigues et al. 2015) and offshore wind turbines (Lagerveld et al. 2014 Hppop  Hill 2016). Box 6.1 provides a particularly informative example of detector systems being usefully combined with radar and thermal imaging systems to document behaviour and flight characteristics. Automated acoustic bat monitoring can be considered the most efficient method available so far for assessing the collision risk for bats at wind turbines (Brinkmann et al. 2011 Behr et al. 2015 Rodrigues et al. 2015 Peterson et al. 2016 Hayes et al. 2019).;Several species of migratory bats cross the open sea, but relatively little is known about their interactions with wind turbines (Hppop et al. 2019). Starting in 2005, a 2 year project investigated the possible impact on migrating bats of wind turbines positioned 14 km offshore in the Kalmar Sound between the Swedish mainland and the island of land (Ahln et al. 2009). The study addressed two questions (1) Do bats cross the Kalmar Sound (including the offshore wind farms Utgrunden and Ytre Stengrund) during migration? and, if so, (2) Is there any potential impact, such as collisions, of bats with wind turbines? This study exemplifies the usefulness of multiple methods for the quantification of encounter frequencies and interactions between offshore wind turbines and bats. Five methods were simultaneously applied to measure bat activities (1) a landbased manual detector survey was conducted of bat departure from two sites on land (Eckelsudde and Ottenby) (2) a manual detector survey of flight activity was carried out from a vessel at sea for 14 nights (total 29 hours) up to 4 hours after sunset (3) bat abundance was recorded with marine radar positioned on the Utgrunden lighthouse whereby bats were distinguished from birds by their
