Figure 7.12 A substructure for the Hywind Scotland floating windfarm project being floated off a heavy transport vessel at Stord in Norway, before being towed 30 km to the east coast of Scotland. (Olaf Nagelhus, Equinor ASA);To ensure that the expansion of offshore wind energy takes place in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner, most European countries developing offshore wind have undertaken action to mitigate noise. However, apart from a few common measures such as the softstart procedure at the beginning of piledriving operations, national approaches are highly diverse (Table 7.3), as also highlighted in a review of the practices in the UK and Germany for use in the developing market in the USA (BOEM 2018). In the UK, for example, the approach is simple in the sense that pile driving operations are subject to onsite marine mammal monitoring by trained observers. The piling team has to postpone the process if observers spot a marine mammal within a 500 m
