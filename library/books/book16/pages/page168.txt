A comparison of the size of a flying bird in the image with known or reference sizes of each species has been used to estimatethe flight height of a bird, at least in broad terms of whether it falls in the collision risk zone of turbines (Thaxter et al. 2016). While this method provides empirical measurements for use in collision risk modelling, it risks being biased if flying birds appear shortened in any way, such as if looking downward when searching for food, or their body is angled upward or downward. This method is also fairly imprecise on account of normal variation in the reference size of each species and because measurement error has the greatest effect farthest away from the aircraft, critically in the zone where birds are recored at or below collision risk height, where greatest precision is needed.;The DAISI system employed by IfA consists of two cameras with lenses mounted to point downwards from the instrument hatch of a Vulcanair P68, pointing at the starboard and port sides of the aircraft either side of the transect line so that a total image width of 407 m is obtained when the aircraft is flown at 423 m a.s.l. with 2 cm GSD. If the aircraft is flown at a ground speed of 180 kph, and images are recorded at 12 second intervals, 50 overlap is obtained between images along the length of the transect. The cameras are mounted on a gyroscopic platform and the cameras have forwardmotion compensation to reduce motion blur (Coppack et al. 2015).;APEM has employed a single mediumformat camera system with a standard lens that is pointed directly downwards from the camera hatch in a Vulcanair P68 or BrittenNorman Islander Mk II. The total image width for this system is approximately 400 m if flown from an altitude of 400 m, achieving an image resolution of 3 cm GSD (Mendel et al. 2018). Typically, these surveys are flown using a striptransect design or as a plotbased survey design. The camera system uses forwardmotion compensation to reduce image
