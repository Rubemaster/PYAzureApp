Figure 6.8 Example of automatic bird detection (birds marked with red frames) by a video camera as part of the DTBird multisensor system.;DTBird has been commercially available for several years and, according to DTBird (2018), 131 units of DTBird and DTBat are installed in 47 existingprojected, onshoreoffshore wind farms in 13 countries (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States). In a 7 month field test, the reliability of DTBird was tested in a wind farm on the Norwegian Island Smla by comparing DTBird output to data obtained from the Merlin mobile avian radar system (DeTect) and tracking data of resident Whitetailed Eagles Haliaeetus albicilla fitted with GPS transmitters (May et al. 2012). The total operation period at Smla spanned 5 years. For radii of 300 m and 150 m around a wind turbine, DTBird registered, respectively, 76 and 96 of all radar recorded birds. Based on a 24 hour recording period, DTBird detected 5980 of all flight movements around the site within a 300 m radius. In contrast, small birds were only rarely recorded, although it remains debatable as to whether this is due to the low
