Table 3.2 Proportion of individuals within taxonomic groups determined to species level from 50 surveys in the German part of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (Wei et al. 2016);Zydelis et al. (2019) compared results from contemporaneous digital video aerial and visual aerial surveys in the German North Sea and found that, apart from grebes, digital video methods were able to identify more seabird taxonomic groups to species than visual aerial methods. They also found that density estimates were higher for most taxonomic groups using digital video compared to visual aerial methods, providing further support for using digital video methods when performing bird and marine mammal surveys at OWFs.
