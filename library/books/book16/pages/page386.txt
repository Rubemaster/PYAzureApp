The construction, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind farms (OWFs) lead to the emission of underwater sound (Box 7.1). Adverse impacts on marine life triggered by unwanted sound, typically termed noise, have become a focus issue in marine environmental research and policy in the European Union (EU) and elsewhere (OSPAR 2009 Tasker et al. 2010 NMFS 2016 Nehls et al. 2019). This is because water is an excellent medium for sound transmission. Many forms of marine life such as fish and marine mammals, and perhaps even some invertebrates, rely on sound as their primary mode of communication, and for orientation and navigation (reviewed by Tyack  Clark 2000 Ladich et al. 2006 Edmonds et al. 2016 Hawkins  Popper 2016). Humangenerated underwater sound can affect marine life by leading to a variety of behavioural responses, masking important sounds and even causing hearing loss in the form of temporary or permanent hearing threshold shifts (TTS and PTS, respectively). At the very high levels received, sound can injure or kill marine life (see reviews by Richardson et al. 1995 Popper et al. 2004 Southall et al. 2007 McGregor et al. 2013). Offshore wind turbines are typically installed on substructures that are connected to the seabed. The most common substructure design is the monopile, a largediameter pile that is driven tens of metres into the seabed. Other design options include jackets, tripods, and gravitybased and floating foundations (Jameson et al. 2019). The installation of monopiles, jackets and tripods involves in most cases impact piledriving. This method isassociated with significant noise emissions in the form of shock waves that are induced by the hammer and propagate away from the pile. Thus, the construction phase is most critical when it comes to environmental impact and management (Madsen et al. 2006 Thomsen et al. 2006 2015 Bailey et al. 2014). There is enough evidence to conclude that underwater sound from impact pile driving can lead to largescale displacement of cetaceans such as Harbour Porpoises Phocoena phocoena, pinnipeds such as Harbour Seals Phoca vitulina and several marine fish species (Brandt et al. 2011 Thomsen et al. 2012 Dhne et al. 2013 Hawkins et al. 2014 Russell et al. 2016). Several studies have shown that the displacement effects are, however, mostly temporary. For porpoises and seals, there is a risk of physiological response in the form of TTS or even PTS closer to the sound source andor at relatively high acoustic doses (Hastie et al. 2015 Kastelein et al. 2016). Physiological effects of impact piledriving on fish are also likely, and mortality very close to the source cannot be ruled out (Thomsen et al. 2006 Popper  Hastings 2009). Indeed, there are anecdotal records of large aggregations of birds seemingly scavenging injured or disorientated fish during or immediately after piling events (Perrow 2019).;Sound is an alteration in pressure that propagates as a wave through an elastic medium. It involves local compression and expansion of the medium. Sound pressure is expressed in pascals (Pa) and the sound pressure level (SPL) in decibels (dB). The decibel is a relative measure of sound pressure that is of logarithmic nature. To derive absolute levels, the measured pressure needs to be related to a reference pressure value. In water, the reference value is 1 Pa, whereas in air it is 20 Pa. To compare decibel levels in air to decibel levels under water, 61.5 dB must be added to the inair values. An addition of 25.5 dB is due to the differences in the reference pressure values. Another 36 dB must be added owing to the higher acoustic impedance of water compared to air. Thus, an SPL of 100 dB re
