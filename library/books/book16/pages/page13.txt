Wind farms are seen to be an essential component of global renewable energy policy and the action to limit the effects of climate change. There is, however, considerable concern over the effects of wind farms on wildlife, especially on birds on bats onshore, and seabirds and marine mammals offshore. On a positive note, there is increasing optimism and evidence that by operating as reefs and by limiting commercial fishing activity, offshore wind farms may become valuable in conservation terms, perhaps even as marine protected areas.;With respect to any negative effects, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) adopted in many countries should, in theory, reduce any impacts to an acceptable level, particularly as this should also incorporate any mitigation required. Although a wide range of monitoring and research studies have been undertaken, only a small body of that work appears to be represented in the peerreviewed literature. The latter is burgeoning, however, concomitant with the interest in the interactions between wind energy and wildlife as expressed by the continuing Conference on Wind Energy and Wildlife Impacts (CWW) series of international conferences on the topic. A total of 342 participants from 29 countries attended CWW 2017 in Estoril, maintaining similar numbers on both counts to that achieved at CWW 2015 in Berlin. Let us hope that CWW 2019 in Stirling (Scotland) has a similar audience. Recent considerable interest within individual countries suggests this should be the case. For example, the Wind Energy and Wildlife seminar (Eolien et biodiversit) including both onshore and
