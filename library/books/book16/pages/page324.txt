For thermal imaging as well as for video systems, the maximum detection range is generally dependent on animal size, sensordimensions and resolution, and camera focal length. The detection of bats and small birds over the full length of a rotor blade, for instance, usually requires a large focal length, although this is also generally dependent on the camera mounting location, such as from structures on the lower platform or nacelle. A longer or large focal length, however, yields a small field of view (as computable with online calculators such as Fulton 2018) and a smaller depth of field (Matzner et al. 2015) (Figure 6.4). Consequently, multiple infrared cameras are generally necessary for detection of bats and small birds within the rotorswept area, coupled with a generally significant increase in equipment power and data storage requirements. Furthermore, detection of avoidance responses with thermal imaging is generally restricted to the rotorswept area (i.e. microavoidance), but permits neither the registration of three dimensional positions of birds nor avoidance responses at a larger spatial scale, such as mesoavoidance or macroavoidance (see Cook et al. 2018).;Figure 6.4 The physical principles that determine camera characteristics, such as resolution of images and detection limits of objects.
