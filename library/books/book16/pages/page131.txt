8,660 km2 sea area over the northwestern part of the relatively shallow Dogger Bank, some 125 km from nearest land to the west in North Yorkshire, and near to the Flamborough Head Special Protection Area, internationally important for its nesting seabird assemblage. The zone was divided into four tranches of work (Tranches AD), each containing two potential project sites. Of these, the greatest focus was placed on Tranche A, containing Creyke Beck A and Creyke Beck B, and on Tranche B, containing Teesside A and Teesside B.;A campaign of both boatbased and digital video aerial surveys was commissioned from Gardline Environmental Ltd and HiDef Aerial Surveying Ltd, respectively, to survey birds and marine mammals in the Round 3 zone and Tranches A and B. Initially for both survey platforms, 41 parallel, equally spaced transects 4 km apart, for a total transect length of about 2,430 km, were designed for survey on a monthly basis between February 2010 and June 2012 (Figure 3.2a). In the boat surveys, alternate transects, and especially those in the respective tranches, were given highest priority in the event of poor weather curtailing surveys before the end of each month. Survey coverage was achieved in all months, but all 41 transects could only be achieved in 5 months, and all of the priority transects in 20 out of 29 months. After the first 2 months, the survey design for digital aerial surveys was adapted to give 3 km transect spacing over the northern Dogger Bank Zone and either 1.4 km or 1.5 km spacing in Tranches A and B in the south. Between November 2013 and October 2014, HiDef adopted its higher specification GEN II camera system, again at 2 cm ground sample distance (GSD), but each transect was 500 m wide and transects were spaced at 6.75 km apart in the wider zone and 3.325 km apart in the north western quarter or Tranche C (Figure 3.2b). Complete coverage of the study area was achieved in almost every month over several days with two or more planes collecting data concurrently.
