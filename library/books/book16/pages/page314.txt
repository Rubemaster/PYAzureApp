Populationlevel effects of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on bat and bird species may result inter alia from (1) collisioninduced mortality (Kunz et al. 2007 Ahln et al. 2009 Masden et al. 2010 Furness et al. 2013 Masden  Cook 2016 Horswill et al. 2017), (2) distortion of flight routes causing detours around wind farms that can impose energetic debts (Masden et al. 2010), and (3) fragmentation or loss of seabird foraging grounds (Garthe et al. 2017), but possibly also (4) from the creation of new foraging and roosting opportunities (Ronconi et al. 2015). Of these, collision effects have attracted considerable empirical, but also theoretical research interest. Empirical evidence on bird mortality at offshore structures, such as platforms and rigs, corroborates the notion that the probability of bird collisions increases with sudden changes to adverse weather when birds are already en route across the open sea (e.g. Aumller et al. 2011 reviewed in Schuster et al. 2015). Under these conditions, nocturnally migrating songbirds comprise the majority of collision victims, as shown in Figure 6.1 and documented in numerous studies conducted on platforms (e.g. Hansen 1954 Aumller et al. 2011 Schulz et al. 2011 Hppop et al. 2016 2019). For offshore wind turbines, however, such information is still missing. Theoretical research includes the development of models to predict collision risk of birds and bats with wind turbines (reviewed in Masden  Cook 2016 Peterson 2016 Cook  Masden, Chapter 5). However, the quality of bird count and flight height data isthought to be insufficient for precise estimates of collision risk (Furness et al. 2013 Green et al. 2016). For example, most data on the interactions between birds and oil and gas platforms are qualitative (Ronconi et al. 2015). Despite the documented empirical evidence of avifauna interactions with wind farms, including fatal collisions (King 2019), accurate estimates of the impetus of wind turbines on demographic rates of birds and bats are missing, owing to inadequate data collection and modelling (Green et al. 2016) as well as poorly developed collision risk assessment (Hppop et al. 2016). Thus, for effective bird and bat conservation it is essential first to gather sufficient quantitative data to support advanced population models, which enable detailed estimates of windfarm effects at the population level.
