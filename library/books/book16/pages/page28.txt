It should be noted that, regarding the effects of vibrations and noise, only limited data are available, covering only a small range of turbine and foundation types. More research and monitoring are needed to understand how particular types of tower, turbine, gear and generator design affect the level of noise transmitted into the water. Earlier types of towerto foundation connectors (grouting) have been replaced with heavy rubber pads that more effectively absorb vibrations. While this is done to prolong the lifetime of the turbine, it has the additional benefit of reducing the noise energy transmitted from the nacelle to the foundation and surrounding water.;As the offshore wind industry develops and occupies more space in the ocean, it becomes increasingly important to implement technical adjustments in order to minimise stressors that generate subtle effects, such as underwater noise, so that longterm ecological effects are prohibited (Slabbekoorn et al. 2010). Underwater noise is included among the 11 descriptors for good environmental status in the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU 2008), and as such, should be limited.
