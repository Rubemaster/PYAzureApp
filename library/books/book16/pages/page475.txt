Figure 8.9 Aggregation of Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus on migration at the Baro S. Joo wind farm in southwest Portugal. (Ricardo Tom);Since thermal currents and updraughts, which are essential for soaring flight, do not form over water, soaring birds avoid crossing large bodies of water during migration. Consequently, they tend to concentrate in places where watercrossing between continents or land masses is shorter. In most cases, turbine shutdown on demand is being applied in wind farms located at such migratory bottlenecks, where hundreds or thousands of migratory soaring birds converge, for example at Tarifa, near the Strait of Gibraltar (de Lucas et al. 2012), Sagres in southwestern Portugal (Tom et al. 2017a) and Gabal el Zait on the west coast of the Gulf of Suez in Egypt (Table 8.2) (Tom et al. 2017b).;In most of these locations there are currently no plans for offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, in places such as the Baltic Sea, where offshore wind energy is being developed at a fast rate, wind farms may intercept migratory routes. This may pose a serious threat to soaring birds because of their difficulties in flying over water, which force them to lose
