20 Pa in air is comparable to an SPL of 161.5 dB re 1 Pa under water.;Different metrics exist to describe continuous and impulsive sounds. In the underwater sound literature, the terms and definitions of these metrics are not used consistently. In this chapter, the nomenclature of ISO 18405 is followed (ISO 2017).;The SPL (given in dB re 1 Pa) is the main metric to describe continuous sounds such as the noise emissions that are associated with drilling or vibrodriving operations. It is derived from the rootmeansquare (RMS) value of the sound pressure averaged over a stated time interval, compared to the reference value of 1 Pa.;Impulsive sounds, such as piledriving strikes, are commonly characterised by the sound exposure level (SEL) (given in dB re 1 Pa2 s), and their peak SPL (given in dB Re 1 Pa). The SEL is a measure of the total sound energy of an impulse, normalised to 1 second (1 s). The SEL is often used to describe the sound energy received by an organism. The SEL(cum) describes the cumulative sound exposure level which takes into account both received level and duration of exposure in relation to individual activitiessources (NMFS 2018). The peak SPL for impulsive sounds is given as zerotopeak sound pressure level (Lp,0pk), derived by the maximum sound pressure of the impulse.;Although SEL and SPL vary in the underlying definitions, they have the same value for the integration time interval of 1 s. For pulses shorter than 1 s down to 100 ms, which typically emerge from impact piledriving, the SPL value is always higher than the corresponding SEL. Caution should be taken when comparing sounds that are described with different metrics.
