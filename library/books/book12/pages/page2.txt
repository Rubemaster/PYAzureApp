Between 1850 and 2009 world primary energy use rose more than fortyfold (Figure 1.4(a)  see Chapter 2 for an explanation of the term primary energy).

This is the total production of the economic system, i.e. the monetary value all the goods and services produced (Figure 1.4(c)).;Figure 1.4 Growth in (a) world primary energy use, 18502009 (b) world population, 18502009 (c) inflationcorrected world GDP in US1990, 18502009 (sources (a) Boden et al., 20 I 0 IEA, 2009 IEA. 20 I Oa LBNL 2009 Maddison, 2005 Maddison, 2009, (b and c) Maddison, 2009);For most of the nineteenth century the worlds principal fuel was firewood (or other forms of traditional biomass), but coal use was rising fast and by the beginning of the twentieth century it had replaced wood as the dominant energy source. During the 1920s, oil in turn began to challenge coal and by the 1970s had overtaken it as the leading contributor to world supplies. By then, natural gas was also making a very substantial contribution, with nuclear energy and hydro power also supplying smaller yet significant amounts.;For most of the nineteenth century the worlds principal fuel was firewood (or other forms of traditional biomass), but coal use was rising fast and by the beginning of the twentieth century it had replaced wood as the dominant energy source.

(For details of these quantities and units see Chapter 2.);To put this into some context the supertanker Sirius Star (Figure 1.6). a very large crude carrier (VLCC), has a capacity of about 300 000 tonnes, so the c.3900 million tonnes of oil used by the world in 2009 (about onethird of total primary energy used) would fill about 13 000 of these.;To put this into some context the supertanker Sirius Star (Figure 1.6). a very large crude carrier (VLCC), has a capacity of about 300 000 tonnes, so the c.3900 million tonnes of oil used by the world in 2009 (about onethird of total primary energy used) would fill about 13 000 of these.oil 32.4;Figure 1.5 Percentage contributions of various energy sources to world primary energy consumption, 2009. Note that the actual amounts of electricity produced by nuclear and hydro power were almost the same, but owing to a statistical convention in the definition of primary energy, the nuclear contribution is multiplied by a factor of nearly three (see Chapter 2) (principal sources BP, 20 IO IEA, 2009 Maddison, 2005 Maddison, 2009WWEA, 2009);Total about 502 EJ, equivalent to 12 billion tonnes of oil, or an average continuous rate of e nergy consumption of 15. 9 TW.;Figure 1.6 A US3m ransom is dropped by parachute onto the oil tanker Sirius Star on 9 January 2009.
