A further 30 is in the former Soviet Union (BP, 2010). Although coal deposits are rather more evenly spread throughout the world, seventy per cent of world coal reserves are concentrated in just four countries Australia, China, Russia and the United States of America. (BP, 2010) (Figure 1.16).;Although human society now consumes fossil fuels at a prodigious rate, the amounts of coal, oil and gas that remain are still very large. One simple way of assessing the size of reserves is called the reservesproduction ratio (RIP)  the number of years the reserves would last if use continued at the current rate (Figure 1.17).;Coal has the largest RIP ratio. Present estimates suggest the world has around 120 years worth of coal left at current use rates. In 2000 this figure stood at over 200 years. World coal production has in fact gone up since then, but reserves have also been revised downwards significantly (see Chapter 5). For oil, current RIP estimates suggest a lifetime of about 45 years at current rates. For natural gas, the RP ratio is somewhat higher, at around 60 years (BP, 2010).;Fossil fuel RIP ratios need to be interpreted with great caution, however. They do not take into account the discovery of new proven reserves, or technological developments that enable more fuel to be extracted from the existing resources. The distinction between reserves and resources is described in Chapters 5 and 7. Additionally, they do not take into account future increases in production, which may also overstate future RP ratios.;Despite these developments, it seems likely that, at least in the case of oil fron1 conventional sources, world production is now near its peak. The IEA s 2010 World Energy Outlook suggests that conventional oil production as eaked and will plateau from now on, but that supplies of natural gas liquids and unconventional oil will continue to increase to 2035.;concentration of scarce fossil fuel resources has already led to ma1orworld  d  cnses an conflicts, such as the 19734 oil crisis and the first and second Gulf Wars of the 1990s2000s.
