The UK government is committed to reducing the countrys greenhouse gas emissions by 80 from 1990 levels by 2050. Chapter 14 briefly looks at what that might mean for future UK energy use. It also looks in a little more detail at the IEA Blue Map scenario whose projected energy use has been shown in Figure 1.22.;This chapter has posed some fundamental questions about energy systems and sustainability and begun to sketch out a framework for developing our understanding of the answers. What is a sustainable energy system?, Why does sustainable energy matter?, How can we achieve the transition to sustainable energy systems? These are profound questions to ask as well as intellectually demanding to answer. The remaining chapters of the book will describe some of the many subtleties and nuances involved in understanding the tradeoffs between one source of energy, one technology, or one social, economic or environmental impact and another.;Aden, N.
