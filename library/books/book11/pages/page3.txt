Figure 3 General components of horizontal axis wind turbine. (Canadian Geographic Learning Centre) Capacity factor The average power output of a wind development divided by its maximum power capability, its rated capacity. Capacity factor depends on the quality of the wind at the turbine. Higher capacity factors imply more energy generation. On land, capacity factors range from 0.25 (reasonable) to over 0.40 (excellent). Offshore, capacity factors can exceed 0.50. Controller The controller starts up the turbine generator at wind speed of about 8 to 16 mph and shuts off the generator at about 65 mph. Cutin Speed The wind speed at which the turbine blades begin to rotate and produce electricity, typically around 10 mph. Cutout Speed The wind speed at which the turbine automatically stops the blades from turning and rotates out of the wind to avoid damage to the turbine, usually around 55 to 65 mph. Gear Box Gears connect the lowspeed shaft to the highspeed shaft and increase the rotational speed of the shaft to the speed required by the generator. The gear box is heavy and power losses from friction are inherent in any gearing system. Generator A device that produces electricity from mechanical energy, such as from a rotating turbine shaft.;1.
