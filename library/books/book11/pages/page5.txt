Bird Mortality Mortality from bird collisions with the turbine blades, towers, power lines, or with other related structures, and electrocution on power lines. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) A naturally occurring gas, and also a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and biomass as well as land use changes and other industrial processes. CO2 is the principal greenhouse gas that is produced by human activity and influences climate change.  Climate Change Changes in a climate system over decades or longer. The term often refers to changes in climate that can be attributed directly or indirectly to human activities that altered the composition of the global atmosphere  changes that are beyond the natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods. Direct Employment The total number of people employed in companies belonging to a specific sector. Emissions The discharges of pollutants into the atmosphere from stationary sources such as smokestacks, other vents, or the surfaces of commercial or industrial facilities, and mobile sources such as motor vehicles, locomotives and aircraft. With respect to climate change, emissions refer to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time. Energy Payback The time period it takes for a wind turbine to generate as much energy as is required to produce the turbine, install it, maintain it throughout its lifetime and, finally, scrap it (Figure 4). External Costs Costs incurred in activities which may cause damage to a wide range of receptors, including human health, natural ecosystems and the built environment, and yet are not reflected in the monetary price paid by consumers.;Figure 5. Offshore turbine technology. The tripod foundation has been used in a few projects, but the floating turbine designs have not been used commercially to date.
