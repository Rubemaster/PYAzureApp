Load In reference to wind developments, load describes the energy demand placed on a power generating facility or the energy consumed by a group of customers or set of equipment. Usually expressed in amperes or watts. Megawatt (MW) 1,000 kilowatts (kW) or 1 million watts (W) standard measure of electric power generating capacity. Large utility scale wind turbines usually produce 900 kW to 2 MW per turbine. MegawattHour (MWh);Laws developed federally or by states mandating that electricity providers obtain a minimum fraction of their energy from renewable resources. In 2008, Michigan passed an RPS requiring that 10 of the states energy come from renewable sources by 2015. Storage Battery Also known as a rechargeable battery. Can transform energy from electric to chemical form and vice versa. Can be connected to turbines to temporarily store electricity in chemical form during peak production times and release electrical energy when demand is high. Substation A facility that steps up or steps down the voltage in utility power lines. Voltage is stepped up where power is sent through longdistance transmission lines. It is stepped down where the power is to enter local distribution lines. Transformer Multiple individual coils of wire wound on a laminate core. Transfers power from one circuit to another using magnetic induction, usually to step voltage up or down. Works only with AC.;Anemometer Measures the wind speed and transmits wind speed data to the controller. Blades The aerodynamic surface that catches the wind. Most commercial turbines have three blades. Braking System A device to slow a wind turbines shaft speed down to safe levels electrically or mechanically.;Figure 2a.
