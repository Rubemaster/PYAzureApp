Alternating Current (AC) An electrical current that reverses direction at regular intervals or cycles. In the United States, the standard is 120 reversals or 60 cycles per second. Electrical grids in most of the world use AC power because the voltage can be controlled with relative ease, allowing electricity to be transmitted long distances at high voltage and then reduced for use in homes.  Direct Current (DC) A type of electrical current that flows only in one direction through a circuit, usually at relatively low voltage and high current. To be used for typical 120 or 220 volt household appliances, DC must be converted to AC, its opposite. Most batteries, solar cells and turbines initially produce direct current which is transformed to AC for transmission and use in homes and businesses.  Efficiency Describes the amount of active electrical power generated as a percentage of the wind power received by the turbine.  GridConnected System A residential electrical system such as solar panels or wind turbines which act like a central generating plant, supplying power to the commercial grid (Figure 1). Inverter A device that converts direct current (DC) electricity to alternating current (AC) either for stand alone systems or to supply power to an electricity grid.
