8) Find the saturationpoint temperature and pressure for P  85 kPa, T  20C, r  8 gkg. 9) Find and plot the net solar radiation as a function of depth within a stratocumulus cloud, given Lr  1000 m, zB  700 m, solar zenith angle  70, and K  900 Wm2. What are the values of the efolding decay length, bulk cloud albedo, and bulk cloud absorption? 10) Find the change in net longwave flux across the top and bottom of a stratocumulus cloud, assuming the following temperatures Tsurface  30C, Tcloud base  25C,;Tcloud top  15C, and Tsky  100 K. 11) Just above cloud top P  80 kPa, T  10C, rT  0.5 gkg. Just below cloud top P  80 kPa, T  5C, rT  10 gkg. Is this stratocumuls cloud unstable for cloudtop entrainment? 12) Calculate and plot the distribution of cloud diameters, assuming the lognormal location and shape parameters are 750 m and 0.75, respectively.
