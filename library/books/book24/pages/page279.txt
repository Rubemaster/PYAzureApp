7.4.2 Surface Fluxes  Geostrophic Drag. Sometimes in numerical or theoretical models, one does not know the winds anywhere near the surface, but one can calculate the geostrophic wind instead. Deacon (1973), Clarke and Hesse (1974), Melgargejo and Deardorff (1974), Arya (1975), Nicholls (1982), and Grant and Whiteford (1987) parameterized surface fluxes in terms of geostrophic wind, using;(7.4.2a)where G is the magnitude of the geostrophic wind, and Co is called the geostrophic drag coefficient. This parameterization is usually not as accurate as the one using surface wind, and should be avoided unless you have no choice. Typical magnitudes of Co were given in Table 72 for continental areas. Table 74 lists suggested values over other areas. Although we are defining geostrophic drag based on u.2  Co G2, some investigators use u.  Co G instead. Be careful to check which defmition is used for Co when comparing values reported in the literature. One parameterization for the neutral geostrophic drag coefficient is;CON  0.0123 Ro 0.14 (7.4.2b)where Ro  G(fc zo) is the surface Rossby number. Its variation with stability is given in Fig 7.11.;Table 74. Typical values of geostrophic drag coefficients (CGN) for neutral stability over avariety of surfaces. After Garratt (1977).
