SBL, and no turbulence at the top, the bulk turbulent heat flux is equal to the surface flux, QH Similarity theory is useful for the contiguously turbulent SBL, where surface forcings can be used as the key scaling variables. Such parameterizations were described in Chapter 9, and were used to scale the variables in Fig 12.3. Also, Ktheory, higherorder closure models. and transilient theory have also been successfully applied to the SBL. For the continuously and contiguously turbulent situation that is in equilibrium with the surface. it is reasonable to use the bulk measures of turbulence described earlier. We expect greater turbulence to occur in stronger winds and over rougher ground. However. weaker turbulence is anticipated during cases of strong cooling at the surface. These influences can be incorporated into a parameterization (Stull, 1983) for the bulk turbulence;(12.2.3g)where Zs is a measure of the surface roughness averaged over many kilometers upwind. The roughness factor. Zs. is not like a roughness length. but has values on the order of 2 to 10 km. This roughness factor must be determined aerodynamically for each wind direction at each site based on observed SBL development. because no direct description for it has appeared in the literature. Instead of using wind . speed directly in the above parameterization the pressure gradient forcing fe G is used because it drives the winds (Estoumel and Guedalia. 1985). Note that the definition of G includes a factor of 1  fe thus making the product fe G independent of fe as required for these schemes to work in tropical regions. The variation of B with geostrophic speed and direction for Wangara is shown in Fig 12.8.; speed and direction for the Wangara field III experiment. (After Stull, 1984).
