As discussed in section 4.3.1, molecular destruction of turbulent motions is greatest for the smallest size eddies. The more intense this smallscale turbulence, the greater the rate of dissipation. Smallscale turbulence is, in tum, driven by the cascade of energy from the larger scales. Daytime dissipation rates (see Fig 5.13) are often largest near the surface, and then become relatively constant with height in the ML. Above the ML top, the dissipation rate rapidly decreases to near zero. At night (see Fig 5.14), both TKE and dissipation rate decrease very rapidly with height. Because turbulence is not conserved, the greatest TKEs, and hence greatest dissipation rates, are frequently found where TKE production is the largest  near the surface. However, the dissipation rate is not expected to perfectly balance the production rate because of the various transport terms in the TKE budget.;1. 4 Doy 12 Fig. 5.13 10 Range of normalized diSSifeation rateh ) 08 profi es during t e Z daytime. where z i is Z, MLdepth and w.is 06 the convective velocity scale.
