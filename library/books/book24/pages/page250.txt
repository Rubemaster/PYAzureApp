Berkowicz  Prahm suggested that larger eddies are more effective at causing diffusion (i.e., have larger K) than smaller eddies (see Fig 6.15). Based on this concept, they suggested that;(6.9d)where the two parameters, Ko and Bo are both assumed to be proportional to the 43 power of the wavelength at the peak in the TKE energy spectrum. In other words, this is an apriori approach, where some knowledge of the spectrum of turbulence is assumed. Ko has units of m2 sl, while Bo has units of m43. This spectral dependence of K yields;where the two parameters, Ko and Bo are both assumed to be proportional to the 43 power of the wavelength at the peak in the TKE energy spectrum. In other words, this is an apriori approach, where some knowledge of the spectrum of turbulence is assumed. Ko has units of m2 sl, while Bo has units of m43. This spectral dependence of K yieldsa plot of E(z,Z,t) vs. (zZ) that looks very similar to the plot ofY(z,Z,t) in Fig 6.13, with a peak of E at zZ  0 and tails that approach zero at both sides.;Ko K larger eddies smaller eddies Fig. 6.15 Spectral diffusivity K(K) as a function of wavenumber K. After Berkowicz and Prahm 1979.;When spectral diffusivity theory is used to predict the spread of smoke puffs within a homogeneous turbulent environment, the result shown in Fig 6.16 is a slow dispersion rate initially while the puff is small. Later, when the puff is larger, it grows at the same rate as would be expected for normal (nonspectral) Ktheory. In the figure, Bo  0 corresponds to the normal Ktheory dispersion, while Bo  3 m43 is the dispersion with spectral diffusivity.
