514 BOUNDARYLAYERMETEOROLOGYindicate layers where turbulence is likely. During the night, these turbulent layers can form and dissipate, and reform at other heights. Mahrt, et al. (1979) found that the Richardson number is large at altitudes corresponding to the LU maximum, but they found smaller Richardson numbers and more intense turbulence just above the jet where shears are stronger and static stability is weak. Forecasting the Richardson number for the SBL can be tenuous because of its sensitivity to relatively small changes in potential temperature and wind profile gradient (see Fig 12.10, for a different case, after Gossard and Frisch, 1987). Also, coarse measurement of the bulk Richardson number across a thick layer might yield a large value (Le., nonturbulent), while measurements made at higher resolution over the same region might indicate the possibility of thin layers of low Richardson number (Le., turbulent).;300 e Ma1ch 1986 070 MST Fig. 12.10 Profiles of (a) measured 200 temperature and (b)  measured potential temperature gradient x at 0740 MST on 6 100 March 1986 near the BAO tower. (After Gossard and Frisch, (b) 1987).;Subsidence. The fair weather conditions associated with clear skies and strong nocturnal radiative cooling are also those associated with anticyclones, divergence and subsidence. During such conditions, Carlson and Stull (1986) found vertical velocity values of 0.1 to 0.5 mls near the top of the SBL. Subsidence causes warming by bringing down warmer air from aloft. The local warming rate is thus simply the product of the subsidence and the local vertical gradient of potential temperature;Typical heating rates due to subsidence are shown in Fig 12.11. These heating rates are as large as, and sometimes larger than, the radiative and turbulent cooling rates. Thus, neglect of subsidence in the SBL heat budget is not recommended.
