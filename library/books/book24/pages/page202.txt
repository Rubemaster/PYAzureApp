Situation Daytime boundary layer over land. a) Find RB at 2, 4, and 10m. b) Comment on the static and dynamic stability of the air. Is the flow turbulent? 15) If the TKE at 10m is at steady state, and if e  0.01 m2 s3, then is the transport tenn supplying or removing TKE from the air at z  10m? 16) What is the static stability of each of the layers in the diagram at right?;17) This problem is best saved until after the logwind profile has been introduced.
