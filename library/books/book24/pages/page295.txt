Fig. 7.19 Schematic diagram of the twolayer forceresponse model, with a thin upper slab that varies in terJ1)erature ( TG). and a semiinfinite bottom slab WitA constant temperature (TM).;Concept. The depth, d of the top layer is carefully chosen, based on knowledge of the full solutions from the previous section d,  (Vg P)(4n)If2. This is the effective depth that feels the diurnal cycle, and is on the order of several centimeters for a daily cycle in a desert. We see that longerperiod cycles are felt over a deeper depth. Knowing this critical depth, a soil heat capacity per unit area, CGA, can then be found for the surface soil slab CGA  Cg.d,. Typical values of the heat capacity per unit volume are Cg  Ix106 (J m3 Kl) for snow, 1.3x106 for deserts, 3xl06 to 5xl06 for farms, and lx106 for muddy water. With these definitions, the energy balance (7.2b) can be rewritten as a forecast equation for the temperature of the surface slab (Anthes, et aI., 1987)
