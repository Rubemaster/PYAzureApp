Although we will frequently use the word shoreline in this subsection, one should recognize that similar physics applies to other borders as well, such as between two land surfaces with differing albedoes and surface heat fluxes.;Convective TIBL. When air flows from a cooler to a warmer surface, a steady state convective ML (convective TIBL, in this case) forms and deepens with distance downwind of the shoreline (Fig 14.13). Turbulence is vigorous over the bulk of the;Fig. 14.13 Growth of a convective thermal internal boundary layer (TIBl) as a function of distance downwind from the surface heatflux discontinuity.
