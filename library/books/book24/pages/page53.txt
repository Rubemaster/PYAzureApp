In fact, these nonlinear tenns must be retained to properly model turbulence. This is a dramatic difference from many linear theories of waves, where the nonlinear terms are often neglected as a firstorder approximation.;2.4.4 Variance, Standard Deviation and Turbulence Intensity;This is known as the biased variance. It is a good measure of the dispersion of a sample of BL observations, but not the best measure of the dispersion of the whole population of possible observations. A better estimate of the variance (an unbiased variance) of the population, given a sample of data, is;When N is large, as it often is for turbulence measurements, lIN  l(NI). As a result, the biased definition is usually used in BL meteorology for convenience. Recall that the turbulent part (or the perturbation or gust part) of a turbulent variable is;When N is large, as it often is for turbulence measurements, lIN  l(NI). As a result, the biased definition is usually used in BL meteorology for convenience. Recall that the turbulent part (or the perturbation or gust part) of a turbulent variable isgiven by a  AA. Substituting this into the biased dermition of variance gives;N!  2 I  ,2 ,2 OA  N .J a j  aj  0 (2.4.4c);Thus, whenever we encounter the average of the square of a turbulent part of a variable, 2 2 2 9,2 r,2 2 . th . such as u ,v ,w. , , or q ,we can mterpret ese as vanances.
