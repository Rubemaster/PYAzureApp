This is a tremendously large value for curvature. If we assume that such a profile was observed within the the middle of the BL (z0.5zj), where the wind speed is, say 5 mIs, then we can integrate the above equation to find the mean wind at any other height z away from the middle of the BL U(z  0.5zjz)  5  6.67 z2. For example, at a height of 0.5zj  10m, the wind speed would be 672 mIs, assuming no shear at Zj. Since realistic wind speeds and shears are several orders of magnitude smaller over most of the PBL, it is apparent that viscous stress plays a much smaller role than turbulent Reynolds stress in the mean wind equation. As we shall see later, however, viscosity is very important for turbulent motions, and can not be neglected.;The following cases are meant to acquaint the reader with typical observations of some of the terms in the equations of this chapter. They are analyses of real data, most of which are based on the BLX83 field experiment near Chickasha, Oklahoma (Stull and Eloranta, 1984). This data set was taken in fairweather anticyclonic conditions during the daytime when deep convective mixed layers formed. Figs 3.1a through 3.3a show heat and moisture fluxes as measured by an instrumented Queen Air aircraft, flying at about 72 ms along level flight paths of about 30 km long. Measurements of w, T, and q were taken 20 times per second i.e., two measurements per 7.2 m (this is the Nyquist wavelength, discussed in chapter 8). From this data, average values over each flight leg were found, and linear trends were calculated. These were subtracted from the observed values to give w, T, and q.
