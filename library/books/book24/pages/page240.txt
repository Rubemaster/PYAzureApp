Next, assume that there are molecular (non turbulent) fluxes of heat, QH  0.2 K ms, and momentum, F  0.15 m2s2, across the land surface into the air. During a 10 min timestep, we can assume that there is a surface molecular flux into the bottom of the bottom layer, but no molecular flux out of the top of the bottom layer, giving fl91flt  QWflz and flU dflt  Fflz. Neglecting other forcings such as radiation and Coriolis force leaves only the bottom layer altered;11 (ms) 4.1 5 5 7 6 Notice that only the bottom one grid box has changed so far, because we have not yet applied the transilient turbulence to mix these heat and momentum changes higher in the mixed layer. Next, assume that there is turbulent mixing during the 10 min period as specified by the transilient matrix below;Solution to part (a) First, it is easy to verify that the transilient matrix is a valid one, with each row and column summing to one, and no negative elements. Next, to illustrate the solution, look at the second row of the transilient matrix. The second row tells us about fluid that is mixing into the second grid box. For our case, it says that 23.6 comes from box I, 59 stays in box 2, 11.8 comes from box 3, and so forth. Thus, the new state of box two after mixing is;92  0.236(16.2)  0.590(15)  0.118(15)  0.056(16)  0.000(18) 15.34 eC) and;V2  0.236(4.1)  0.590(5)  0.118(5)  0.056(7)  0.000(6)  4.90 (ms);In general we can set up the problem as a matrix multiplication, with the answer indicated below for potential temperature. The same procedure can be used for winds.
