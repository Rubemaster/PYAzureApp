Thus. 100 of the air in box 5 stayed in box 5. and no air was mixed in from other boxes. The initial and final potential temperature and wind profiles are plotted in Figs 6.10ab. Some of the warm air from the surface has been mixed up into the mixed layer. resulting in wanning of the mixed layer and a reduction of the static instability between the bottom two grid points. Also. there appears to be some entrainment into the top of the mixed layer. resulting in an increase in mixed layer depth.;Solution to part (b) For example. the flux at zl00 m (i.e . at kl. between grid points 1 and 2) can be found using recursive relationship (6.8.4b);N we(1) w9(0)   I C1j (91  ) jlw9(1)  o  (100 m  600 sHO.590(16.216.2)  0.236(16.215.0)  0.118(16.215.0)  0.0?6(16.216.0)  0.000(16.218.0) 0.0726 (Kms1) and for momentum;w9(1)  o  (100 m  600 sHO.590(16.216.2)  0.236(16.215.0)  0.118(16.215.0)  0.0?6(16.216.0)  0.000(16.218.0) 0.0726 (Kms1) and for momentumuw(I)  0  (100 m600 s)0.590(4.14.1) 0.236(4.15.0)  0.118(4.15.0)  0.056(4.17.0)  0.000(4.16.0)  0.080 (m2s2)
