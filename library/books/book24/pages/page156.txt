Case Study Examples. The linear decrease of heat flux with height has been discussed in chapter 3 for the daytime cases (Figs 3.13.3 and 3.7). Nighttime heat flux values are much weaker, as shown in Fig 4.19. Fig 4.20 shows the steadystate, nonadvective heat flux budget terms. Large values of terms occur at the surface because of the strong turbulence and mean temperature gradients there. In the middle of the ML, weak potential temperature gradients are associated with smaller magnitudes of the terms there. At the top of the ML the terms become large again, associated with the strong temperature contrast across the ML top.;4.4.4 Flux of a Scalar (Pollutant or Tracer Flux);CUj) o( cu j) oUj ,, oC  cuu j)  U cu .   u j Uj ax. at j ax.
