In most of the previous chapters we assumed a flat, uniform bottom boundary, but in many parts of the world the ground is neither flat nor uniform. Geographic variations can modify the boundarylayer flow, and in some cases generate circulations in conjunction with diurnal heating cycles. We have already touched on a few such flows, such as the drainage winds at night within a stable boundary layer. In this chapter we examine both geographicallygenerated and geographicallymodified flows. Many of the examples will be based on highly simplified and idealized hill structures and surface features, in order to make the problem tractable. Nevertheless, the results can be qualitatively applied to more realistic scenarios.;Warming of mountain slopes by daytime sunlight or cooling by nocturnal radiation causes the air adjacent to the mountain to be warmed or cooled by conduction and turbulence. If the air near the mountain is at a different temperature than the ambient air at the same altitude over the center of the valley, then buoyant forces generate a circulation. Similar forcings occur over flat surfaces where albedo or heat capacity differences generate a horizontally inhomogeneous temperature field. In general, local winds are named after the source location of the wind sea breezes come in from the sea, mountain winds come down from the mountain, etc. In the following discussions we assume that the ambient winds are light or calm. For this situation the geographicallygenerated circulation can be studied without external influences. In many real situations, however, ambient synoptic or mesoscale winds can modify, or even eliminate the weak geographic circulations.
