Physically, (3.3.1e) states that air that is warmer than average is less dense than average. Although not a surprising conclusion, these equations allow us to substitute temperature fluctuations, easily measurable quantities, in place of density fluctuations, which are not so easily measured.;3.3.2 Flux Form of Advection Terms;Advection Term  Uj d1ldXjwhere  denotes any variable, such as a wind component or humidity. If we multiply the continuity equation (3.2.2c) by ,we get  dUjdXj  O. Since this term is equal to zero, adding it to the advection term will cause no change (other than the mathematical form). Performing this addition gives;This is called the flUX form of the advection term, because as was demonstrated in section 2.6 the product of (Uj) is nothing more than a kinematic flux.;Vertical Component. By setting i  3 in (3.2.3b), we can focus on just the vertical component of momentum to study the role of gravity, density, and pressure on turbulent motions. Utilizing U3  Wand the definition of the total derivative, dUdt  dUdt  Uj dUdXj, gives;Vertical Component.
