GAB  Co  i Q (S.S.2b)where Co  FAr FBr  F Ai FBi (S.S.2c) and Q  FAi FBr  FAr FBi (S.S.2d);Although not explicitly written in the equations above, FA and FB are functions of n, making both the cospectrum and quadrature spectrum functions of n too Co(n) and Q(n). The cospectrum is frequently used in meteorology, because the sum over frequency of all cospectral amplitUdes, Co, equals the covariance between A and B, (Le.,;1 Co(n)  a b ). Note that the cospectrum computed as above is NOT equal to the n spectrum of the time series of the product ab. The quadrature spectrum is usually not used directly, but it too has a physical interpretation. The quadrature spectrum is equal to the spectrum of the product of b times a phase shifted a, where a is phase shifted a quarter period of n. In other words, the amount of time lag applied to a depends on the frequency, n, such that the phase shift is always 90 for each n. Three additional spectra can be constructed from the quad and cospectra. An amplitude spectrum, Am, can be defined as;A large amplitude at any frequency n implies that A is very strongly correlated to B at that frequency, regardless of phase differences between A and B. In other words if both A and B have a strong amplitude component with frequency n  5 even if A and B are out of phase, then Am will be large for n  5. Also, if the amplitude is small for any frequency
