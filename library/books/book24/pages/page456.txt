448 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYtriangle that was 450 m on a side. with each sensor 4 m above the ground during the PHOENIX experiment (Fritz and Wang. 1979). This optical triangle. centered on the BAO tower. measured convergence as shown in Fig 11.8a. The shortperiod oscillations in convergence are probably correlated with plume structures. and agree fairly well with the vertical velocities measured at the 100 m height on the tower (Fig 11.8b).;Time series of divergence from a small optical triangle compared with vertical velocity fluctuations recorded at the 100 meter level of the BAO tower. (After Fritz and Wang. 1979).;Dust devils are rotating updrafts of buoyant air that frequently form in fair weather conditions (Fitzjarrald. 1973 Golden. 1974 Idso. 1975a.b.c Kaimal and Businger. 1970. News and Notes, 1976 Sinclair, et al., 1977). They are not necessarily associated with clouds, and are not related to tornadoes or water spouts. Tangential velocities in dust devils are on the order of 10 ms, compared to 50 ms for water spouts and 100 ms for tornadoes. Diameters of the order of tens of meters, and depths of about 100m are typical. Dust devils are visible to the naked eye because the tangential velocities are sufficient to pick up dust from the ground, and vertical velocities on the order of 4 ms can carry the finer dust aloft. Close cousins are steam devils, formed in steam fog regions of cold air advection over warm bodies of water or other moist surfaces. and ash devils. formed over ground covered by volcanic ash. There is evidence that dust devils form
