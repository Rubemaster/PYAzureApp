Fig 2.15 shows idealizations of the turbulent heat, momentum, and moisture fluxes for both the daytime and nighttime BLs. During the daytime, the fluxes are large, and usually change linearly with height over the ML. At night, the fluxes are much weaker.we (Kms1);o. lilA  III  111  , ... 1111111111.11  111  1111   ..
