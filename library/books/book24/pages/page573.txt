The GATE t1ata was obtained over the eastern tropical Atlantic (Nicholls and LeMone, 1980), where light winds (3 to 5 mls) and cooler sea surface temperatures resulted in weaker mixing of the BL. The tradewind inversion was at lower altitudes in the GATE area (e.g., at about 750 m), and longwave radiative cooling of the BL approximately balanced convective heating. Both the Puerto Rican and GATE data exhibited mesoscale variability in cloudiness, and both had suppressed, nonprecipitating cumulus clouds. The Voves data was taken over central France during the summer, where stronger convection and weaker environmental stability resulted in a deeper boundary layer with taller cumulus clouds. Betts and Albrecht (1987) show a selected set of soundings from over the equatorial Pacific Ocean obtained during the 1979 FGGE experiment (Fig 13.16). This diagram represents an average of 84 individual soundings, where only those soundings having active clouds capped by an inversion below 60 kPa (600 mb) are included. The vertical line rising from the Se curve represents the adiabatic rise of a parcel starting from 98 kPa;(980 mb), and indicates positive buoyancy (where it is warmer than the Ses curve) between about 95 and 85 kPa (950 and 850 mb). The capping inversion is enhanced by subsidence, but is also modified by radiative cooling.;) ) VI 85 VI 85 VI VI CII CII J I.,.J  Q 90 Q 90  e  ,,8 es 95 95 e  1000 4 8 12 16 20 100 300 320 340 360 r (gkg) 8 v e e 8 es (K);Fig. 13.16 Average profile of r, ey,ee and ees, against pressure for selected FGGE cases.

Weak cold frontal passage earlier in the day reduced the instability of the lower atmosphere, preventing thunderstorm development. Examples of fluxes and variances averaged horizontally are shown in Fig l3.18, based on the analysis of Nicholls, et al. (1982). We find significantly large variances, particularly of temperature, within the cloud layer. Nicholls and LeMone (1980) found that clouds affect the distribution of heat and moisture within the subcloud layer, but had
