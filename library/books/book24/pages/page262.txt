Picture a layer of air with its top just above the highest trees (or ocean wave crests) in a region, and its base just below the earths surface (or below the wave troughs), as sketched in Fig 7.2a. This layer has turbulent energy transfer with the air above it, radiative transfer through the top of it, and molecular energy transfer into the soil (or sea) below.;Fig. 7.2 Contributions to the surface energy balance (al for a finite thickness box and (b) for an infinitesimally thin layer. 0 s is the net radiative contribution, 0 H is turbulent sensible heat flux, 0 E is turbulent latent heat flux, OGis molecular flux into the ground, and ll.Os is storage.;In simple terms, this is nothing more than energy in balancing energy out and storage. The external forcing is Q s and all the other terms are response terms.
