Term VIII represents pressure redistribution, which is associated with the retumtoisotropy term.;Case Study Examples. Budget study is the name given to an evaluation of the contributions of each term in prognostic equations such as the ones just derived. Some terms are very difficult to measure in field experiments, which is why computer simulation efforts are made. In the budget studies that follow, field data and numerical simulations are combined, and the range of values is indicated. In most cases, field measurements have significantly more scatter than the simulations.
