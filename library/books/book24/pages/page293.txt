Combining this with the previous equation gives the classical heat conduction equation;(7.6.2c)where Vg  kgCg is the soil thermal diffusivity. Typical values for Vg are 2.7xlO,7;(m2s) for snow. 2.0 xlO,7 to lxlO,6 for farms. and 1.5 xlO,7 for water. A variety of solutions to this classic equation for various boundary conditions are given in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering texIS. For a soil with uniform thermal diffusivity with depth, the boundary conditions often used are (I) periodic temperature variation at the surface, and (2) no temperature change
