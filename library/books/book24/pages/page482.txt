10 50 100 Portion of FA air The entrainment zone (El) can be defined in terms of the fraction of FA air. (a) Overshooting thermals cause rawinsonde soundings to indicate improper values of z I. Solid line is the local ML top, while the dashed line is the average ML top, Zl. (b) Variation of fraction of FA air with height in the entrainment zone as measured by horizontal avera es solid line and a int soundin dotted line.;When horizontal averages of temperature or moisture are taken by aircraft in the EZ, the resulting profile of percentage of FA air vs height exhibits a smooth profile (Fig 11 .29b). However. a rawinsonde sounding made through a single point will likely show a sharp jump (Mahrt, 1979) in temperature. moisture and wind (Fig 11.29b) when it encounters the local ML top. Since this local top can be at a significantly different altitude than the average top depending on which location is penetrated by the sensor, we recommend that single rawinsonde soundings NOT be used to estimate Zj. Rawinsonde Zj errors can easily be as large as 0.4 Zj.;When the ML is shallow in the morning over land. the EZ is proportionally shallow. As the ML grows, so does the EZ thickness (see Fig 11.10). Thin EZs are expected for large temperature changes across the ML top. because thermals will not penetrate as far and entrainment will be slow. Thick EZs are expected with more intense ML turbulence where convection is vigorous. Deardorff. et al. (1980) have suggested that the ratio of EZ thickness (t.h) to depth of the ML (using ho as one measure). is;0.21  1.31 (Ri) (l1.3.2a)where RiO is a convective Richardson number. defined by
