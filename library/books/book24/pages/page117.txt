Fig. 3.9 Observed eroliles of mean horizontal wind during Day 33. Wangara (Clarke. et al . 1971).;At nighttime the turbulence is often less vigorous. As a result. other effects such as advection. radiation. and subsidence become as important or more important than turbulence in causing changes in temperature and humidity. For example. Fig 3.10 shows BLX83 field experiment data taken during the night of 18 June 1983 near Canton. Oklahoma (Carlson and Stull. 1986). Part (a) shows the temperature evolution between 2100 CDT (plotted as circles) and 2230 CDT (plotted as squares), as observed by special high resolution rawinsonde balloon soundings. Cooling is evident near the surface during this 1.5 hour period, while there is wanning aloft. Also during the night, measurements were made of radiation budgets and subsidence. Computer models were then used to estimate the contributions of the terms in (3.5.3f) towards the total coolingheating. These contributions are shown in part (b), where the grey lines represent the turbulence part, the dotted line represents radiation divergence. and the solid lines represent subsidence contributions. For the grey and the solid lines, two curves are shown to indicate how they evolved with time between the initial and the final soundings. It is apparent that subsidence and radiation dominate in the upper part of these sounding, but turbulence becomes more important near the ground.
