The equations of Chapters 3 to 5 include the mean advection terms, and will not be discussed in more detail here. Neglect of advection is unwarranted for most simulations of real boundary layer. One measure of the relative importance of turbulence vs. the mean wind is the dimensionless convective distance, XML (Willis and Deardorff, 1976)
