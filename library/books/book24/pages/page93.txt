This is a reasonable approximation because the equation of state was originally formulated from measurements made with crude, slowresponse sensors that were essentially measuring mean quantities. As we shall see in section 3.4, however, we cant make similar assumptions for the other governing equations.

Subtracting (3.3.lb) from (3.3.la) leavesp;Static pressure fluctuations are associated with variations in the mass of air from column to column in the atmosphere. For the larger eddies and thermals in the boundary layer, these fluctuations may be as large as 0.01 kPa (0.1 mb), while for smaller eddies the effect is smaller. Dynamic pressure fluctuations associated with wind speeds of up to about 10 mls also cause fluctuations of about 0.01 kPa.
