When turbulence in a mixed layer is driven by buoyancy and capped at a well defined height. it is obvious that w. and Zj are important scales for all variables. In addition.;When turbulence in a mixed layer is driven by buoyancy and capped at a well defined height. it is obvious that w. and Zj are important scales for all variables. In addition.when considering heat. moisture. and momentum fluxes we should include the e.ML q. ML. and u.ML scales. respectively. Many investigators have examined the convective mixed layer and unstable surface layer (Businger. et.a!.. 1971 Lenschow. 1974 Lenschow. et a!.. 1980 Caughey and Readings. 1974. 1975 Caughey and Palmer. 1979 Kaimal. et a!., 1976 Smedman and Hogstrom. 1983 Wyngaard. et.a!.. 1971 LeMone and Pennell. 1976 Brost. et.a!.. 1982 Berkowicz and Prahm. 1984 Webb. 1982 Zhou, et.al . 1985 and Sorbjan. 1986). In the surface layer. local freeconvective or MoninObukhov similarity can be applied depending on the relative importance of surface heating and stress (Wyngaard. et.a!.. 1971 Berkowicz and Prahm. 1984 Sorbjan, 1986).;9.6.1 Mean Variables and Their Gradients;1.4for 0.1 Zj S Z S 0.9 Zj;for 0.1 Zj S Z S 0.9 Zjfor O.lzj S Z S O.9zj;for O.lzj S Z S O.9zjfor 0.1 Zj S Z S 0.9 Zj;Investigators (Mahrt and Andre. 1983) have become more aware that forcings can occur at the top of the mixed layer that are quasiindependent of the forcings at the ground. Entrainment can introduce fluxes at the top of the mixed layer. and shear across the entrairunent zone can generate additional turbulence that does not scale with w . Wyngaard and Brost (1984) and Moeng and Wyngaard (1984) have suggested a conceptual model called top down  bottom up diffusion, which models the contributions of mixing down from the top of the ML separately from mixing up from the ground. One result of this approach is a similarity relationship for gradients of mean variables within the middle 80 of the ML. The relationship for pollutant concentration is given below. but it can be applied just as easily to temperature. moisture, or wind gradients. More details of this method are discussed in Chapter II.
