Waves are trapped within the SBL.;Vertical wave displacement amplitudes range from fractions of meters to about 200 m (NaiPing. et aI.. 1983 Hooke and Jones. 1986 Finnigan. et aI.. 1984). Fig 12.19 shows waves with displacement amplitudes between 10 and 100 m. Large amplitude waves can induce surface pressure fluctuations as large as 10 Pa (0.1 mb). although most waves create pressure fluctuations smaller than 5 Pa (0.05 mb). These can be easily measured with surfacebased microbarographs. Waveinduced pressure variations can be large compared to the 1 Pa fluctuations associated with typical turbulent wind gusts (Gedzelman. 1983). Because wave amplitudes can be large compared to the depth of the SBL. we might expect the state of the SBL to be strongly modulated by such waves. This is indeed the;Vertical wave displacement amplitudes range from fractions of meters to about 200 m (NaiPing. et aI.. 1983 Hooke and Jones. 1986 Finnigan. et aI.. 1984).

This is indeed thecase. as is shown for NB the shear squared, gradient Richardson number, and TKE in Fig 12.21 for one wave period (Finnigan, et aI., 1984). For this case, the Richardson;Fig. 12.21 VlIriation of the shear squared, BruntVaisala squared, Richardson number, and turbulence kinetic energy as a function of wave phase.
