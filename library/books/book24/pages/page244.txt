Part 2 consists of the transilient mixing to reduce any now instabilities that might have developed during part 1. After Stull (1987).where IIYII is a scalar norm of matrix Y, and;N c ..  t  L c .. II 1J jl j .. i;N c ..  t  L c .. II 1J jl j .. ito satisfy the conservation constraint discussed earlier.;The potential for mixing depends on the instability of the flow, so a natural starting point for the parameterization of Y is the TKE equation. Start with (5.tb), neglect the turbulent transport and pressure correlation terms for now, allow for an arbitrary coordinate direction, integrate over time, and then normalize the resulting equation by dividing by the TKE. Next, and most importantly, we hypothesize that the result can be interpreted nonlocally, where gradients can be expressed as differences across finite distances. Let 6ij refer to a nonlocal difference between grid points i and j for example,;The first two terms on the right represent the mechanical production, the third term is the buoyant productionconsumption, and the last term represents dissipation. The Yij values found from (6.8.6c) are the preliminary offdiagonal elements of a Y matrix. We recommend that the mixing potential for eddies of any size be no less than the mixing potential for larger size eddies. In other words, if there is strong mixing between
