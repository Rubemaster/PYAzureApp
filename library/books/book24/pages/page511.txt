This definition for a depth scale can be applied even if there is no sharp demarcation at the SBL top (Fig 12.4). Typical magnitudes for HAe range from o to about 150 m. Rearranging (12.1.2b) and substituting e for  shows that the accumulated cooling within the SBL is;where e(z)  eo  e(z).

Hence, B is a measureof the overall effect of external forcings on the SBL. Typical magnitudes range from 3 mK for light turbulence through 15 mK for strong turbulence.;12.1.3 Idealized Models for the Potential Temperature Profile;The wide variety of observed flow states has resulted in a variety of idealized models for the longtime averaged picture of SBLs. No single model works for all situations, so the best model should be chosen on a casebycase basis.;Stable Mixed Layer. At the one extreme, strong winds, strong turbulence and weak surface cooling can lead to wellmixed layers (Zeman, 1979) that behave as described in Chapter 11.; 0 for z  h e(z)  constant for z  h (12.1.3a);Although buoyancy acts like a sink rather than a source, there is enough mechanical mixing by the wind shears to create a mixed layer (Fig 12.5a). This layer can grow in depth by entrainment, although entrainment rates generally decrease during the night as the stability across the entrainment zone increases. For a wellmixed layer, it is easy to show that the integral depth scale equals the actual SBL depth h  HAG
