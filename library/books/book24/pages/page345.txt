s  sin2xnkN  sin2xnkN and c  cos2xnkN  cos2xnkNand where the overbar denotes an average over all N data points of the original time series. In the definitions of s and c above, note that the overbar terms in each expression are identically equal to zero only for n equal to an integer value. Given the best fit from above, we can compute the correlation coefficient squared, r2(n);If waves at frequency n explain a lot of variance in the original signal, then r2(n) is close to 1. Otherwise, it is closer to zero. For integer values of n, r2(n) is equal to the normalized spectral intensity, EA(n)sA2, of the FFf. This is where the spectral information comes from. We must solve (S.9b  c) many times, for each different value of n that we are interested in. To calculate a complete spectra, we should solve the equation for at least the N different integer values of n. Thus, when r2(n) is plotted vs. n, the result is a spectrum. As an example, the spectra plotted in section S.7 could have been labeled as r2 vs n, where r2 would have been computed using periodogram methods. Note that we can also solve the equations for noninteger values of n, and for n in the range 0 to I, if desired, although sine waves of noninteger values are not mutually orthogonal.;Contained within the nonlocalclosure transilient matrix is information about the amount of fluid that mixes between each pair of gridpoint locations in a column of air during a finite time. This information can be extracted and grouped to yield spectral information about the contributions of different wavelengths to the overall mixing process. Such a spectrum differs from the spectrum of the fluid state obtained from harmonic analysis (FFf) of measurements of temperature, velocity or other state variables, as described in all the previous sections of this chapter. Tennekes (1976) pointed out that the FFf Fourier modes do not have a onetoone correspondence with eddies.
