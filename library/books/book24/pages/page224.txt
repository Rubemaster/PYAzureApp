than helped us. With firstorder closure we had the 3 unknown fluxes uw, vw,w 9 . The addition of the variance equations did not eliminate these fluxes as unknowns,;w 9 . The addition of the variance equations did not eliminate these fluxes as unknowns,and in fact added 6 more unknowns. So why did we do it? The reason is that knowledge of the TKE and temperature variance gives us a measure of the intensity and effectiveness of turbulence. Hence, we can use this information;and in fact added 6 more unknowns. So why did we do it?

Hence, we can use this informationwithin improved parameterizations for eddy diffusivity, Km(e, 9  One suggested set of parameterizations for the unknowns is;(6.Sb)where the A factors are empirical lengthscale parameters. These length scales are often chosen by trial and error, in an attempt to make the simulated flow field match observed laboratory or field cases. One problem with the closure of (6.5b) is that the length scales are rather arbitrary. The expressions for K are too complex to reproduce here, but can approximately be represented by;K  A e 12 (6.Sc)where A represents one of the empirical length scales.
