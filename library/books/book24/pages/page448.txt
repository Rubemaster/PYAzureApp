H you made the following measurements withan instrumented mast, find themoisture flux w q , at z  6 m using the profile;20) Suppose you have the mast data from problem (19), but no infonnation on wT norwq. Use the Bowen ratio method to find wT and w q, given tls 00  0.6;21) Given a heat flux of QH  P w (Cp T) and specific heat Cp  (1 0.84q).;Expand and simplify the expression for  in tenns of kinematic fluxes of heat,moisture, etc. The expansion given in Section 10.7.1 had deleted some tenns that were small compared to the others, so it will be different than your answer here (with no tenns deleted).
