The empirical straight line estimate from similarity theory is also shown in (b).;Discussion. We hope to be able to use this equation to diagnose the value of the buoyancy flux at any height within the interior of a convective mixed layer on any other day at any other location, assuming we know the surface flux and the mixed layer depth. Even without this equation, we could use Fig 9.1b to determine the flux at any height.;For example, suppose the aircraftmeasured buoyancy flux of w e v   0.1 Kms1 ata height of z  200 m when the mixed layer depth was Zj  1300 m. We can used this;In 1914 Buckingham proposed a systematic approach for performing dimensional analysis. He called the resulting dimensionless groups Pi groups, which later caused the theory to be known as Buckingham Pi Theory (Perry, et al., 1963). For each step of his approach we will first define the general procedure (in boldace), and then give an example (in normal type face). The example is that of fluid flow through a pipe, and involves the question How does the shear stress, t, vary?
