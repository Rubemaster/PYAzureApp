Dot Product  .   mn (2.8.3b) m n;Cross Product  x   Emnq Oq (2.8.3c) m n;Del Opemtor V( )  O maX m (2.8.3d);On the first line, we substituted each vector by its summation notation as three Cartesian components times their respective component magnitudes. On the second line, the vector (boldface) terms were grouped together, leaving the product of the magnitudes remaining at the end. Then, the definition of a vector dot product was used to substitute the Kronecker delta. Finally, the Kronecker delta was used to change one subscript to equal the other. The end result, Am Bm  Al BI  A2 B2  A3 B3 , is indeed a scalar that is equal in value to the scalar result of the vector dot product. A similar development can be made for the cross product of two vectors;E mnq ABo m n q (2.8.3f);The result is a vector, as is required for a cross product between two vectors. The reader can perform the implied sums to verify that the expected terms are obtained. Note that;Emnq  Eqmn  Enqm resulting in equivalent but differentlooking expressions for (2.8.3f).
