Draw the mixing line on the diagram, and plot the points corresponding to the following mixtures of environmental air from cloud top and cloud base (top,base) (50,50), (30, 70), (20, 80), and (10,90). c) If there is additional mixing within the cloud (for example, the SO50 mixture air mixing with the 10t90 mixture air), where do these mixtures fallon the mixing line? 4) Suppose the mixed layer includes the points at 100 to 90 kPa in the previous example.
