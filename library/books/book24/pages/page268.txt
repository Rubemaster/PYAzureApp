(7.3.2b)where 0SB  5.67xlO8 Wm2K4 is the StefanBoltzmann constant. The infrared emissivity, t IR, is in the range 0.9 to 0.99 for most surfaces.;The downward longwave radiation IJ. is much more difficult to calculate, because one must vertically integrate the radiative flux divergence equations. Simple radiation models are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13. Putting together the various pararneterizations for short and longwave radiation yields the following approximation for net radiative flux at the surface;(7.3.2c)where S is negative. One must remember that this is just one possible parameterization. Other equally good approximations have appeared in the literature.;Problem Calculate the radiation budget terms for every hour during a 24hour cycle, given the following scenario location Madison, Wisconsin (latitude  43.08N, longitude  89.42W) clouds none date 5 November (day 309) start time midnight local time. average albedo 0.2;Solution The following example was prepared, solved, and plotted using spreadsheet software, which is available for most microcomputer systems. Table 71 lists the spreadsheet results for this case. First, the latitude and longitude was converted to radians, and the solar declination angle was found using (7.3.ld). This angle was 0.284 radians (16.27). The negative sign tells us that the northern hemisphere is in, or approaching, winter. For each of the 24 hours, the local time was converted to UTC time. For this example, the conversion was done using longitudes rather than political time zones, knowing that it takes the earth 24 hours to rotate a full 360 degrees of longitude. Next, (7.3.lc) was used to find sin I (sinphi) at each time, where sinphi was set to zero whenever the sun was below the horizon. Next, the transmissivity T K was calculated using (7.3.la). Then Kdown was found using (7.3.lb), and Kup was found using (7.3.le). The net longwave radiation, 1, was found using (7.3.2a). Finally, the net radiation was calculated using Q  Kup  Koown  1 , which is a form of (7.3).
