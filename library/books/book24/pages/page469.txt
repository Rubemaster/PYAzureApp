The corresponding potential temperature and heat flux profiles are shown in Fig 11.16. Evident are the curvature of the potential temperature promes, and the nearly linear heat flux profiles. On this day there were significant mechanical contributions to turbulence in addition to the dominant buoyant contributions. Heating of the lowest grid point by surface fluxes generated buoyant instabilities, to which the transilient model responded by generating mixing and producing a ML, as shown in the figures here and discussed in Chapter 6.;Thermals are large columns of rising buoyant air in the convective mixed layer (Fig 11.17). The convective circulation, including both the thermal updraft and associated downdraft, have horizontal scales of roughly 1.5 Zj (Caughey and Palmer, 1979 Young, 1988). Thus, early morning thermals are on the order of 100 m in diameter, while by late afternoon when the mixed layer is deeper thermals can be 1 to 2 km in diameter. The vertical extent of a thermal is also roughly equal to the ML depth.;Fig. 11.17 Idealized vertical cross section showing thermals. The local and average mixed layer tops are ZI andZi. respectively.;Vertical velocities in thermals can reach 5 mls or more, although weaker updrafts of 1 to 2 mls are more common. Velocities scale to the convective velocity scale, w . Samples of vertical velocity (Caughey, et aI., 1983 Deardorff and Willis, 1985) measured both in and between thermals typically show a negatively skewed distribution in the bulk of the ML (Fig 11.18), although the distributions tend to become more symmetric in the entrainment zone. There are a large number of weak interthermal downdrafts, and a small frequency of strong thermal updrafts. In a very idealized sense, this is pictured (Fig 11.19) as broad regions of gentle downdraft surrounding smaller regions of strong updraft.
