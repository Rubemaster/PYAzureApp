32 BOill.DARY LAYER METEOROLOGYthere is evidence of the Rossbywave cycle in our wind speed record. The next peak, at 24 h, shows the diurnal increase of wind speed during the day and decrease at night. The rightmost peak is the one we will study in this book. It indicates the microscale eddies having durations of 10 s to 10 min, just what we would have guessed from examining Fig 2.1 by eye.;Within the rightmost peak we see that the largest eddies are usually the most intense. The smaller, high frequency, eddies are very weak, as previously discussed. Largeeddy motions can create eddysize windshear regions, which can generate smaller eddies. Such a net transfer of turbulence energy from the larger to the smaller eddies is known as the energy cascade. At the smallest size eddies, this cascade of energy is dissipated into heat by molecular viscosity. The flavor of this energy cascade was captured by Lewis Richardson in his 1922 poem Big whorls have little whorls, Which feed on their velocity And little whorls have lesser whorls, And so on to viscosity (in the molecular sense). In a later chapter we will describe the mathematical tools necessary to calculate spectra.
