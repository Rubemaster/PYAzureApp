One physical interpretation of the Obukhov length is that it is proportional to the height above the surface at which buoyant factors first dominate over mechanical (shear) production of turbulence. For convective situations, buoyant and shear production terms are approximately equal at z  0.5 L. Fig 5.21 shows the typical range of variations of the Obukhov length in fair weather conditions over land. The parameter S turns out to be very important for scaling and similarity arguments of the surface layer, as will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter. It is sometimes called a stability parameter, although its magnitude is not directly related to static nor dynamic stability. Only its sign relates to static stability negative implies unstable, positive implies statically stable. A better description of S is a surfacelayer scaling parameter. We can write an alternative form for S by employing the definition of w.; Z  k z w.3 S  L   Zi u.3 (5.7d);Fig. 5.22 shows the variation of TKE budget terms with S, as  varies between 0 (statically neutral) and 1 (slightly unstable). The decrease in importance of shear and increase of buoyancy as  decreases from 0 to 1 is particularly obvious.;2 rr, Residual (maybe pressure term) Buoyant Production .E  t   ., .............. , ..  .. , ..  ..
