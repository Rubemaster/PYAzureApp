When 10gSA(0) vs. log f is plotted, the result allows a wide range of frequencies and spectral densities to be displayed. Also, any power law relationships between SA (0 and f appear as straight lines on this graph. As will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter, SA(O is proportional to fS!3 in the inertial subrange portion of the spectrum, which will appear as a straight line with 53 slope on a loglog graph (see Fig. 8.ge). Unfortunately, the area under the curve is no longer proportional to the variance. ;Log f SA (0 vs. log f. A plot of 10gf.S A (0) vs. log f, has all of the desirable characteristics of the loglog presentation described above. In addition, the quantity fSA(O has the same units as the variance of A, making scaling or normalization easier. Unfortunately, the area under the curve is also not proportional to variance (see Fig. 8.90. Regardless of this problem, this presentation is the most used in the literature.
