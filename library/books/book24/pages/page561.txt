CLOUDS 555saturation tnlxmg ratio on temperature. Computerized solutions can be designed to iterate the equations to solve for temperature. Alternately, linearized simplifications can be used (Betts, 1982) to give an approximate solution.;The physics relevant for radiation within and between clouds requires knowledge of liquid water content, cloud droplet size distribution, cloud temperature, cloud surface shape, cloud cover, solar zenith angle, and many more (Welch and Wielicki, 1984 Schmetz and Beniston, 1986). It is a very complex problem that is beyond the scope of this book. We will focus on only the simplest parameterizations here for continuous stratusstratocumulus cloud decks. By neclecting radiation from cloud sides and weighting the radiation budget by the cloud cover, the stratocumulus radiation parameterization below can be extended in crude form to scattered cumulus clouds. Fig 13.4 shows profiles of upward and downward short and longwave radiation for a stratocumulustopped marine boundary layer during the day (Nicholls, 1984). Solar radiation is absorbed over a depth on the order of hundreds of meters in the top of this cloud, while infrared radiative divergence occurs within about 30 m of the cloud top and bottom. These are discussed in more detail next.;Fig. 13.4 Average (a) solar, K, and (b) IR, I, radiation fluxes. The extent of the stratocumulus cloud layer is shown by the shadin . After Nicholls, 1984).;Fig 13.5 shows the vertical profile of net solar radiation (K  K.L  Ki ) for an idealized 500 m thick cloud within a 1000 m thick BL (Hanson, 1987). The exponential decrease in net radiation with depth below cloud top causes warming within the top 100 to 200 m of the cloud. Lower in the cloud there is less absorption and less heating. There is no noticeable solar flux divergence at cloud base. The cloud shades the ground, reducing
