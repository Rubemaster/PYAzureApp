Polynomial. Fourth. the SBL can be described (Yamada. 1979) by a polynomial that passes through the surface value of potential temperature. and has a zero gradient at the top of the SBL (Fig 12.5d).;(12.1.3d)where parameter a is usually taken as 2 or 3. Above h it is assumed that a  O. The relationship between integral depth and SBL top is h  (l  a) HA9 All four;where parameter a is usually taken as 2 or 3. Above h it is assumed that a  O.

An additional forcing, local terrain slope, will be discussed separately in Section 12.7. It will be shown that none of these forcings can be neglected.;Unsaturated conditions. The absence of solar radiation in nocturnal boundary layers allows one to focus on only the longwave radiation budget (Le., Q  1). Strong radiative cooling of the ground surface occurs at night, with net upward radiative fluxes of about 100 Wm2 (0.8 K mls), as already discussed in Chapter 7. In addition, radiation divergence within the air causes small, but significant, cooling in the boundary layer above the ground. This insitu radiative cooling was neglected for the ML, but can not be neglected in the SBL because many of the other flux terms are small too.
