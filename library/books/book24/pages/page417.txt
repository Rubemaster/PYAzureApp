Most radiometers measure the radiative wanning of a tinted surface, where the surface is protected from conductive and convective heating inside a glass or plastic hemispherical or spherical chamber. Depending on the type of tinted surface and the exposure, the radiometer can be designed to measure radiation in specific frequency bands coming from specific directionsradiometer  total radiation (all wavelengths) from all directions within one hemisphere (upward or downward) hitting a plane surface that is parallel to local horizontal net radiometer  difference between top and bottom hemispheres pyranometer  short wave (solar) radiation, one hemisphere, plane horizontal surface net pyranometer  difference between top and bottom hemispheres, short wave only pyrheliometer  short wave direct beam radiation normal to surface (shielded from diffuse) diffusometer  pyranometer with a device to shade it from direct sunlight prygeometer  long wave (IR), one hemisphere, plane horizontal surface.
