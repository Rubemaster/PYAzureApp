Discussion We see that in a ML with constant divergence, the subsidence velocity increases with height, making ML growth more difficult. In fact, for our particular example, the ML top can not grow past 2 km, because at that height the subsidence is strong enough to completely counteract entrainment (Fig 11.27). As we will discover in section 11.4, the entrainment velocity also becomes smaller as the ML deepens. These two factors combine to limit the depth of the ML. Cases have been observed in the field where subsidence becomes so strong as to push the ML top downward, even while entrainment is happening.;Discussion We see that in a ML with constant divergence, the subsidence velocity increases with height, making ML growth more difficult.
