Fig. 6.1 Movement of an air parcel (shaded line) within a background having linear moisture and wind gradients (heavy line). The superposition of many such parcels, starting at different levels but all ending at level Z, forms the conceptual basis for mixing length theory.;In Sections 2.6 and 2.7 it was shown that the kinematic eddy flux of moisture is R ;In Sections 2.6 and 2.7 it was shown that the kinematic eddy flux of moisture is R wq. Since we know q from (6.4.4a) and w from (6.4.4c), we need only multiply the two together, and then average over the spectrum of different size eddies z to get the average flux R;72 1 au 1 (aq) R  c (z ) az Glz (6.4.4d);R. In this way, we can define a mixing length, I, by P  C z,2. Thus, the final expression for moisture flux is;21 au I (aq) Rl Tz az (6.4.4e);2 I aU 1 KE  I Tz (6.4.4f);2 I aU 1 KE  I Tz (6.4.4f)because that leaves us with R   KE (aqaz). In fact, mixinglength theory tells us via (6.4.4f) that the magnitude of KE should increase as the shear increases (i.e., a measure of the intensity of turbulence) and as the mixing length increases (i.e., a measure of the ability of turbulence to cause mixing).
