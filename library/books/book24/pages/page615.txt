7.12). Thus, surfacelayer air in cities is generally warmer than that of their surroundings (Oke, 1982, 1987 Goldreich, 1985 Bomstein, 1987). When isotherms are plotted on a surface weather map, the pattern looks like the topographic contours of an island (Fig 14.20), whence the term heat island.;Fig. 14.20 Idealized isotherm heatisland pattern over an urban area (shaded). (After Oke, 1982).  Wind;The greatest temperature differences between urban and rural areas are usually observed during the night (Fig 14.21). In many cases, heat from the city is sufficient to maintain a shallow convective mixed layer at night, even while a substantial stable boundary layer has developed over the surrounding countryside (Fig 14.22). Cities with a population of about 1000 have been observed to have maximum temperature excesses (compared to the surrounding rural area) of 2 to 3 C, while cities of a million or more inhabitants have been known to generate excesses of 8 to 12C (Oke. 1982 Katsoulis and Theoharatos. 1985).
