The standard deviation always has the same dimensions as the original variable. Fig 2.6 shows the relationship between a turbulent trace of wind speed and the corresponding standard deviation. It can be interpreted as a measure of the magnitude of the spread or dispersion of the original data from its mean. For this reason, it is used as a measure of the intensity of turbulence. In figure 2.1, for example, we might guess the standard deviation to be about 0.5  0.6 mls at noon, dropping to about 0.3 mls by 1400 local time.;The standard deviation always has the same dimensions as the original variable.

Solid line connects the data points heavy dashed line is the average dotted lines are drawn one standard deviation above and below the mean. Based on the example data in section 2.4.5.;For mechanically generated turbulence, one might expect OM to be a simple function of M. As we learned in Chapter I, 10.5 is required for Taylors hypothesis to be valid.;N! II   covar(A,B)   (A.  A)(B.  B) Nil i  0
