Normalized velocity variance verses height in statically neutral conditions, where h (2km) is the height where v is zero . Based on a largeeddy simulation by Mason and Thomson (1987) using ug10mls, VgO. and u. 0.4 mls;Fig 4.2 shows that vertical velocity variance during the daytime is small near the surface, increases to a maximum about a third of the distance from the ground to the top of the ML, and then decreases with height. This is related to the vertical acceleration experienced by thermals during their initial rise, which is reduced by dilution with environmental air, by drag, and by the warming and stabilizing of the environment near the top of the ML. In cloudfree conditions with light winds, glider pilots and birds would expect to fmd the maximum lift at ZZj  0.3 . At night, turbulence rapidly decreases over the residual layer, leaving a much thinner layer of turbulent air near the ground, as is shown in Fig 4.3. The depth of this turbulent SBL is often relatively small (h  200 m). In statically neutral conditions the variances also decrease with height from large values at the surface, as shown in Fig 4.4 (Mason and Thompson, 1987) however, the depth scale is much larger (h  2 km). Fig 4.5 shows that the horizontal components are often largest near the ground during the day, associated with the strong wind shears in the surface layer. The horizontal variance is roughly constant throughout the ML, but decreases with height above the ML top. At night, the horizontal variance decreases rapidly with height to near zero at the top of the SBL (Fig 4.6). This shape is similar to that of the vertical velocity variance. The budget term discussion for velocity variance will be deferred to Chapter 5 because of the close association of velocity variance with turbulent kinetic energy.
