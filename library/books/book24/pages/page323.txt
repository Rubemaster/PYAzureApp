314 BOUNDARYLAYERMETEOROLOOYwhere 6.n is the difference between neighboring frequencies. When n is used to represent frequency, n 1. For other representations of frequency such as f, we will find that f is not necessarily equal to unity. The SA(n) points estimated from (8.6.2b) can then be connected with a smooth curve to represent the shape of the spectrum. An example of this was shown in Chapter 2, Fig. 2.2. Thus, even with discrete meteorological data, we can estimate spectral densities that can be compared to theories.;Problem Use the results from the N  8 data point example of section 8.4.2 to calculate the discrete spectral energies for all frequencies. Plot the result in the usual presentation format for discrete spectra. Show an additional graph of the estimate of spectral density.;7.0 ( mean) 0.28  1.03 i 1.14 2.28 0.5 0.25 0.5 0.78  0.03 i 0.61 1.22 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.78  0.03 i 0.61 0.5 0.25 0.28  1.03 i 1.14
