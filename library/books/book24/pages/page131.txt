Time Scale The velocity and length scales can be combined to give the following free convection time scale, t.z. t.  1 w. (4.2b);This time scale is on the order of 5 to 15 minutes for many MLs. Observations suggest that this is roughly the time it takes for air in a thennal to cycle once between the bottom and the top of the ML.;Temperature Scale Using surface heat flux with w., we can defme a temperaturescale for the mixed layer, e.ML, by;This scale is on the order of 0.01 to 0.3 K, which is roughly how much warmer thermals are than their environment.;Humidity Scale Surface moisture flux and w. can be combined to define a mixedlayer humidity scale, l., ML;Magnitudes are on the order of 0.01 to 0.5 gwater (kg.irrl and scale well to moisture excesses within thermals. With these convective scales in mind, we can return to the equation derivations.;Basic Derivation.
