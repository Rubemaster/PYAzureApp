(9.S.3e);Equations (9.S.3 d and e) include an additional ratio for the variance at the top of the boundary layer (assuming a welldefined top) nonnalized by the surface stress. Although this ratio is expected to vary from situation to situation, during the KONfUR experiment (Grant, 1986) it was found to equal 2.0 for both equations.
