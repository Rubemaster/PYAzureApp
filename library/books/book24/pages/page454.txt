We can envision the plume as analogous to a vacuum cleaner that propagates horizontally faster than the mean surface wind, and peels up warm surfacelayer air into the trailing edge of the plume. Similar processes have been suggested for the inflow and ramp structure in small cumulus clouds (Telford, 1986). Most of the turbulent heat flux happens near the trailing edge of the plume. Fig 11.5 shows highly smoothed vertical cross sections of the temperature, velocity, pressure, and fluxes within a plume. The picture imagined above applies only to convection over a uniform surface. Surface inhomogeneities that are hotter than average (asphalt parking lots or dark plowed fields) or taller than average (hills, tree lines, hedgefence lines, dikes) can trigger plumes. Glider pilots look for these favored areas for enhanced lift. One last caution about the word plume. For air pollution and diffusion the word plume usually refers to a quasihorizontal smoke plume downwind of an emission source. This can get confusing, because the dispersion of smoke plumes in the surface layer depend on the quasivertical buoyant plume structures just defined.;11.1.3 Surface Convergence Bands and Updraft Curtains;The unaided eye can detect microfronts and surface convergence bands from cats paws on lakes, observed variations in precipitation densities, steam fog patterns, blowing leaves and dust, and wavy fields of grain. Quantitative measurements of surface convergence bands have been made with Doppler radar (Kropfli, 1979).; i J 0 ....
