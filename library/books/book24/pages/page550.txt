4) Assume a nqcturnal boundary layer with QH   0.02 K mls (constant throughout the night), Zs  3 lan. Also assume that the transition to negative heat flux happens at 8 PM local time (call this time t  0), and that the heat flux becomes positive at 6 AM.;V   O. Assume that the initial conditions at sunset are U  6 mls and V  3 mls.;Use the inertial oscillation method to answer this question. 7) Weather stations are often located in the bottom of valleys. Will such a station give surface winds that are representative of the synopticscale flow? Why? 8) Name two theories for nocturnal jet formation. 9) Given initial conditions at 1800 local time during Day 1 with an adiabatic temperature;Use the inertial oscillation method to answer this question. 7) Weather stations are often located in the bottom of valleys. Will such a station give surface winds that are representative of the synopticscale flow? Why? 8) Name two theories for nocturnal jet formation. 9) Given initial conditions at 1800 local time during Day 1 with an adiabatic temperatureprofile ( 6  290 K) up to z    2 lan, no temperature step at the top of the ML,;profile ( 6  290 K) up to z    2 lan, no temperature step at the top of the ML,but a constant lapse rate of Y  d6dZ  0.01 KIm. Also given the same surface heat flux plotted in question (1), except that the constant nighttime flux is 0.1 K mls. When in the morning of Day 2 will an elevated thin layer of smoke 500 m above the ground be fumigated down to the ground? Hint use an exponentialshaped SBL potential temperature profile with B  10 mK at night, and use the thermodynamic (encroachment) method for the ML during the day. 10) Calculate the average speed as a function of downslope distance for an advective gravity flow, where the slope is 200 and the average temperature departure (ambient temperature minus drainage flow temperature) is 3 K. 11) Derive using similarity arguments the spectral power law for enstrophy cascade in a SBL. 12) Prove the averaging rules of (12.6.2f). 13) Derive the linearized equations of motion for which (12.6.2a  b) are solutions.;14) Derive an expression for u w  w 9 and TKE for a linear wave, using (I2.6.2a).
