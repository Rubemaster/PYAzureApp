For many largescale numerical weatherforecast models the lowest gridpoints (at height zl above the surface) are so high that the surface layer is not resolved. Nevertheless, it is important to account for varying roughness in the model forecast. Andre and Blondin (1986) suggested that the effective roughness length (zoeff) to be used in the model decreases as the altitude of the lowest grid point increases. In particular, the ratio (Zoeff)hO decreases from about 0.1 to 0.01 as ZI increaes from 0.1 Jan to 1 km. Taylor (1987), however, suggests that Zoeff is independent of zl;Over land, if the individual roughness elements are packed very closely together, then the top of those elements begins to act like a displaced surface. For example, in some forest canopies the trees are close enough together to make a solidlooking mass of leaves, when viewed from the air. In some cities the houses are packed close enough together to give a similar effect namely, the average rooftop level begins to act on the flow like a displaced surface.;Fig. 9.7 Flow over forest canopy showing wind speed, M, as a function of height, z. The thick canopy layer acts like a surface displaced a distance, d, above the true surface. Zo roughness length.;Above the canopy top, the wind profile increases logarithmically with height, as shown in Fig 9.7. Thus, we can define both a displacement distance, d, and a roughness length, zO such that
