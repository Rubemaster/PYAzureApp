 Strong drag against the earths surtace. Large energy dissipation.;Winds  Near logarithmic wind speed profile in the surtace layer. Subgeostrophic, cross isobaric flow common.;Thickness  Varies between 100 m to 3 km in time and space. Diurnal oscillations over land.; Small molecular diffusion. Otten rapid horizontal transport by mean wind.;Less variable. 818 km. Slow time variations.; The primary energy source for the whole atmosphere is solar radiation, which for the most part is absorbed at the ground and transmitted to the rest of the atmosphere by BL processes. About 90 of the net radiation absorbed by oceans causes evaporation, amounting to the evaporation of about I m of water per year over all the earths ocean area. The latent heat stored in water vapor accounts for 80 of the fuel that drives atmospheric motions.  Crops are grown in the BL. Pollen distributed by boundary layer circulations.  Cloud nuclei are stirred into the air from the surface by BL processes.  Virtually all water vapor that reaches the FA is first transported through the BL by turbulent and advective processes.  Thunderstorm and hurricane evolution are tied to the inflow of moist BL air.  Turbulent transport of momentum down through the BL to the surface is the most important momentum sink for the atmosphere.  About 50 of the atmospheres kinetic energy is dissipated in the BL.  Turbulence and gustiness affects architecture in the design of structures.  Warm and cold fronts separate boundary layers of different temperature.  Wind turbines extract energy from the BL winds.
