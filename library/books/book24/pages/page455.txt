Fig 11.6 shows one example, where the volumemean wind has been subtracted. Horizontal convergence patterns resembling fish nets or honeycombs can be seen in the flow. The scale of the cell size in the net is about 2 km for this case, suggesting that these surface patterns are artifacts of mixedlayer thermals rather than surfacelayer plumes. Other examples not shown here suggest surface layer scales, with pattern cell dimensions on the order of hundreds of meters. In these fish net patterns we can see lines of enhanced convergence. Above these lines it is likely that there exist sheets or updraft curtains of rising buoyant air. These updraft curtains might be one realization of the elongated plumes described earlier. At the intersection of these curtains (i.e., at the knots in the fish net) we would expect to find enhanced buoyancy and rising motion. Although it is difficult to study directly, we can infer that a number of these curtains merge to form the largerdiameter thermals in the mixed layer. Young (1988) points out the similarity of surface layer structures to the corresponding entrainment structures at the top of the mixed layer. Namely, updraft curtains in the surface layer merge to form larger more diffuse updrafts, while entrained downdraft curtains in the entrainment zone become more diffuse mixedlayer downdrafts. Together, these structures can be envisioned as sketched in Fig 11.7.;Fig. 11.7 Idealization of the similarity between plumes rising from the bottom of the ML and entrained air descending from above.
