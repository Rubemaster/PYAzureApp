Spectral Diffusivity Theoryx Fig. 6.16 Top and bottom edges of a passive tracer puff with downwind distance. for Ktheory and spectral diffusivily theory. After Berkowicz and Prahm (1979);The initial slower dispersion rate and nonGaussian distribution of tracer concentration is common to both transilient theory and spectral diffusivity theory. Although some experimental evidence supports these results. they differ from those of statistical dispersion theory .;Andre, J.C.  P.
