An alternative approach, called ee closure (or ke closure in the engineering literature) avoids the A uncertainty by including a highlyparameterized prognostic equation for the dissipation rate in addition to the equation for TKE (Beljaars, et aI., 1987 Kitada, 1987 Detering and Etling, 1985). The dissipation equation, which should be included with (6.5a), is sometimes written as;An alternative approach, called ee closure (or ke closure in the engineering literature) avoids the A uncertainty by including a highlyparameterized prognostic equation for the dissipation rate in addition to the equation for TKE (Beljaars, et aI., 1987 Kitada, 1987 Detering and Etling, 1985).

The following additional closure assumption should also be added to (6.5b);where the parameters are c1  1.44, ca  1.0, and ct3  1.92. The following additional closure assumption should also be added to (6.5b)w 1 ;(6.5e)where c4  1.3. In place of (6.5c), the eddy diffusivity can now be parameterized as;(6.5f)where Co  0.3. Similarly, the remaining length scales in (6.5b) are hopefully more accurate because they are a function of prognostic variables;By studying Figs 6.4 to 6.6, we can learn some of the advantages of higherorder closure. (1) The higherorder scheme creates nearly wellmixed layers during the daytime that increase in depth with time. (2) At night, there is evidence of nocturnal jet formation along with the development of a statically stable layer near the ground. (3) Turbulence intensity increases to large values during the day, but maintains smaller values at night in the nocturnal boundary layer. Firstorder closure, on the other hand, gives no information on turbulence intensity or temperature variance. Furthermore it has difficulty with well mixed layers that have zero gradients of mean variables. However, the benefits of higherorder closure do not come cheaply they are gained at the expense of increased computer time and cost compared to ftrstorder closure.
