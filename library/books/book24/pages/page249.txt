Many other closureparameterizations can be formulated that lead to interesting theoretical results.;We saw in Section 6.4.1 that Ktheory can be used to approximate a flux as w S  K;We saw in Section 6.4.1 that Ktheory can be used to approximate a flux as w S  Koz. When this is put back into the conservation equation for ,a passive tracer, o ;owSoz, we arrive at the diffusion equation ot  K 02oz2, where we haveassumed that K is not a function of z for simplicity. Suppose that K varies with eddy size (Berkowicz and Prahm, 1979 Prahm et al., 1979 Berkowicz, 1984). If we let ICwavenumber of the eddy, then we can spectrally decompose the diffusion equation to be;(6.9a)where K(IC) is called the spectral turbulent diffusivity. By integrating this equation over all wavenumbers, we again arrive at the forecast;TM (z,t)  iJz  (6.9b)and where the integration is over the domain of turbulence. The similarity of this to (6.8.7b) is striking. 3(z,Z,t), which has units of mis, is called the turbulent diffusivity transfer function, and is defined by
