I) Derive equation (7.3.lc) using basic geometric principles. (Note, there are other equivalent forms of this equation, based on various triginometric identities.) 2) What is the local sun angle above the horizon at 1900 lITC on 25 December at a) Madison, Wisconsin b) Christmas Island (Line Islands) c) Seattle Washington d) Tallahassee, Horida e) Munich, W.Germany f) Barrow, Alaska? 3) Estimate the net radiation, Q, at Madison, Wisconsin on 25 June at noon local daylight time, if there are 28 cirrus clouds and 38 cumulus clouds. 4) Based on the discussion of atmospheric conductance in section 7.4, if atmospheric resistance is defined as the inverne of conductance, then what are the units and typical magnitude of atmospheric resistance? 5) Estimate the 10 m drag (CD) and heat transfer (CH) coefficients over land, given z  1 cm, and the Obukhov length  20 m. How would they differ if the static stability were neutral? 6) Given the following data, estimate the values of a. 1 b. Q;CQH dQE e. Bowen ratio Given location is Clam Lake, WI (a town with albedo  20) Latitude  46 deg 10 min N Longitude  90 deg 54 min W Local time of day is 10 AM CST (central standard time  local time  lITC  6 h) Date is April 10, 1981 Cloud cover is 50 of sky covered by altocumulus Surface relative humidity is 80  Anemometerlevel humidity is 60  wind is 5 mls Surface temp is 15C Use the methods discussed in the surface forcings section of boundary layer characteristics. 7) Using the desert Q data below, apply the forcerestore method to calculate the heat flux into the ground and the ground temperature for at least the following times of day 8, 12, 16,  24 local time. Justify all assumptions. Assume that the deep soil temperature is 20C.
