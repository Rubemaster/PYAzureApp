1) It has been suggested that in regions of strong static stability, the lower (long wavelength, small wavenumber) end of the inertial subrange occurs at a wavenumber, s given by 1(B  NBV3l e1l , where N BV is the BruntVaisala frequency, and e is the turbulence dissipation rate. Between this wavenumber and lower wavenumbers is a region called the buoyancy subrange, where the gravitational effects (i.e., buoyancy) are imponant. Within the buoyancy subrange sketched below, would you expect turbulence to be isotropic?;0 0.5 295 1 0.5 293 2 1.0 295 3 0.8 298 4 0 .9 292 5 0.2 294 6 0.5 292 7 0 .0 289 8 0.9 293 9 0.1 299
