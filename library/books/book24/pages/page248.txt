We must integrate (6.8.7b), using the initial condition that e(Z)  9(z) equals 0 for Z;Discussion These initial tendencies are plotted in Fig 6.14c. Just above the temperature jump the tendency is negative, indicating cooling. Just below the jump, there is warming. The net result is that turbulence is tending to round the corners of the temperature sounding by mixing cooler air up and warmer air down. Also, these initial tendencies are nonzero a finite distance away from the jump, something that can not be modeled with a local closure theory such as Ktheory.;6.8.9 Closure Parameterization of the Continuous Form
