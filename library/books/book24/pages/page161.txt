Turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is one of the most important variables in micrometeorology, because it is a measure of the intensity of turbulence. It is directly related to the momentum, heat, and moisture transport through the boundary layer. Turbulence kinetic energy is also sometimes used as a starting point for approximations of turbulent diffusion. The individual terms in the TKE budget equation describe physical processes that generate turbulence. The relative balance of these processes determines the ability of the flow to maintain turbulence or become turbulent, and thus indicates flow stability. Some important dimensionless groups and scaling parameters are also based on terms in the TKE equation. For these reasons, our study of turbulence kinetic energy will begin with the TKE budget equation, and end in a general discussion of stability and scaling.;The definition ofTKE presented in section 2.5 is TKEm  e  0.5 (u,2  v,2  w;Using summation notation, it is easy to rewrite this as e  0 .5. We recognize 1 immediately that TKEm is nothing more than the summed velocity variances divided by two. Therefore, starting with the prognostic equation for the sum of velocity variances (4.3.lg) and dividing by two easily gives us the TKE budget equation
