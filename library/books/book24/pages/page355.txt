For a number of boundary layer situations, our knowledge of the governing physics is insufficient to derive laws based on first principles. Nevertheless, boundary layer observations frequently show consistent and repeatable characteristics, suggesting that we could develop empirical relationships for the variables of interest. Similarity theory provides a way to organize and group the variables to our maximum advantage, and in tum provides guidelines on how to design experiments to gain the most information.;Similarity theory is based on the organization of variables into dimensionless groups. Fortunately, there is a dimensional.analysis procedure called Buckingham Pi theory that aids us in forming dimensionless groups from selected variables. It is hoped that the proper choice of groups will allow empirical relationships between these groups that are universal  namely, that work everywhere all the time for the situation studied. The four steps in developing a similarity theory are (1) select (guess) which variables are relevant to the situation, (2) organize the variables into dimensionless groups, (3) perform an experiment, or gather the relevant data from previous experiments, to determine the values of the dimensionless groups, (4) fit an empirical curve or regress an equation to the data in order to describe the relationship between groups.
