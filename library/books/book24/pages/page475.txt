MIXED LAYER 467meander horizontally and bifurcate and merge as they rise. Nevertheless, thermals are anisotropic, with most of their energy in the vertical.;RHI scan taken on 17 July at 1052 COT. The li1ht areas are areas of high aerosol concentrations carried aloft by rising convective plumes. The left overlay graph is the potential temperature profile at 1104 COT. The right overlay is the normalized covariance profile of the aerosol density inhomogeneities. (After Hooper, 1982).;When hot spots exist on land surfaces, thermals predominantly form there (Smolarkiezicz and Clark, 1985). Glider pilots look for such hot spots as indicators of persistent lift (Reichmann, 1978). Over moist or vegetated surfaces, thermals are often moister than their environment. They are also usually more turbulent. Thermals are observed over oceans as well as land surfaces, suggesting that a surface hot spot is not necessarily needed as a triggering mechanism. In the absence of hot spots, thermals can be swept into lines or rings by weak mesoscale motions called secondary circulations. These patterns are visible from satellite by the cloud streets and openclosed cells. The ultimate hot spot was created in a classical field experiment in France (Benech, et al., 1986 Noilhan, et aI., 1986 Noilhan and Benech, 1986) where an array of 105 oil burners generating a total heat output of 1000 MW distributed over 15000 m2 of the surface were used to artificially create a convective thermal. Upwind of the warm updraft a cool downdraft was observed, while downwind a cool updraft was found. A pressure deficit of about 0.1 kPa (1 mb) was generated near the surface under the updraft, which induced horizontal convergence.
