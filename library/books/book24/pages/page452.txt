444 BOUNDARY LAYER MEfEOROLOGYmore vertical when the shear is weak. and the buoyancy strong. For weak. convection and strong winds, plumes are elongated in the alongwind direction with an aspect ratio of approximately 8 1. Lengths of hundreds of meters (e.g., 500 m) and widths of tens of meters are typical in strong winds. In weak. winds and strong convection, the opposite pattern occurs, with elongation in the the crosswind direction, contraction in the along wind direction, and a meandering propagation like a miniature front. When a plume moves past a flXed mast or tower, the resulting temperature trace shows a characteristic ramp structure or sawtooth shape close to the surface, as sketched in Fig 11.3. The diffuse leading edge marks the start of the warming temperatures in the ramp, while passage of the trailing microfront results in a sharp I2C drop in temperature back to the surrounding environmental values. Higher in the surface layer (above about 30 m), the microfront becomes more diffuse and the temperature excess in the plume becomes smaller.;Fig. 11 .3 Idealized structure of a surfacelayer plume. (After Schols, 1984,1985,1986, and Wilczak, 1984.);Air within a plume accelerates upward due to its buoyancy,leading to average vertical velocities of about 1 mls. The vertical acceleration helps prevent the plume from increasing its tilt within the sheared environment of the surface layer. Air in the ramp is more turbulent than the surrounding descending air, resulting in venical velocity fluctuations of on the order of 5 mls in the ramp. In fact, in some random spots within the ramp the vertical velocity is downward.
