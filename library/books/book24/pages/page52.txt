The averaging rules of the last section can now be applied to variables that are split into mean and turbulent parts. Let A  A  a and B  H  b. Starting with the instantaneous value, A, for example, we can find its mean using the fifth and third rules of the previous section;The only way that the left and right sides can be equal is ifio (2.4.3a);This result is not surprising if one remembers the definition of a mean value. By definition, the sum of the positive deviations from the mean must equal the sum of the negative deviations. Thus the deviations balance when summed, as implied in the above average.;Similarly, A b  O. One should not become too lax about the average of primedvariables, as is demonstrated next. The average of the product of A and B is
