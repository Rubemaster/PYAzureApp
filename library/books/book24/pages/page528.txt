Brook, 1985 Garratt, 1985). In many cases, the LU forms during the night and reaches its peak during the predawn hours (Figs 12.15 and 12.16). These LLJs are often called nocturnal jets. Examples include  Koorin nocturnal jet (Australia)  Great Plains noctumal jet (USA) In other cases, the jet forms during the daytime  Paracas LU (peru)  Southerly Buster LU (EastAustralia) Chiles Atacama boundary layer wind peaks twice, once from the southwest during the afternoon, and then from the northeast at night (Lettau, personal communication). The East African (S0mali) jet lasts day and night for many days.;(a) Wind speed and (b) p)tential temperature evolution during Wangara Night 1314. (After Malcher and Kraus, 1983).;Different investigators have used different criteria for identifying LUs. Some have required wind speeds greater than a specific speed (e.g.,12, 16, or 20 mls) below a specified height (e.g., WOO, 1500, or 2500 m), while others require the speed to be supergeostrophic (Bonner, 1968 Brook, 1985). We will pragmatically define the LLJ as occurring whenever there is a relative wind speed maximum that is more than 2 mls faster than wind speeds above it within the lowest 1500 m of the atmosphere. Investigations have shown that there are many possible causes for the LLJ (Kraus, et al., 1985), including  synopticscale baroclinicity associated with weather patterns  baroclinicity associated with sloping terrain  fronts  advective accelerations  splitting, ducting and confluence around mountain barriers  land and sea breezes  mountain and valley winds  inertial oscillations
