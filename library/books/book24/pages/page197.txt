The effects of viscosity and stability in suppressing turbulence are also intertwined, as sketched in Fig 5.24b. In Section 3.5.1 we defined the Reynolds number as the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, with no mention about buoyancy. In section 5.5.3, we defined a Richardson number as the ratio of buoyant to inertial or mechanical forces, with no mention of viscosity. In the atmosphere, the Reynolds number is usually so large that it corresponds to the rightmost edge of Fig 5.24b. Thus, we can essentially ignore viscous effects on stability in the atmosphere, and focus on the static and dynamic stability instead. In conclusion, we see that the TKE equation is critical for determining the nature of flow in the BL. The relative contributions of various turbulence production and loss terms can be compared when rewritten as dimensionless scaling parameers. These parameters can be used to define layers within the BL where the physics is simplified, and where a variety of similarity scaling arguments can be made (see chapter 9 for details of similarity theory).;Andre, I.C., G.
