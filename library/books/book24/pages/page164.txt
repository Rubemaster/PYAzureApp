Fig. 5.2 Sample diurnal variation of observed range of turbulence kinetic energy, ii,in the surface layer during November. After Louis, et al. (1983).;Fig 5.3 indicates that the vertical profile ofTKE can sometimes increase to a maximum at a height of about zz  0.3 when free convection dominates, as modeled for the Wangara experiment. When strong winds are present, the TKE might be nearly constant with height within the BL, or might decrease slightly with height as shown in Fig 5.3 for BLX83 data. At night, the TKE often decreases very rapidly with height, from a maximum value just above the surface. Over surfaces such as oceans that do not experience a large diurnal cycle, the storage term is often so small that it can be neglected (i.e., steady state can be assumed). This is not to say that there is no turbulence, just that the intensity of turbulence is not changing significantly with time.;Fig. 5.3 The lines show modeled vertical profiles of turbulence kinetic energy, e, during Day 33, Wangara, (after Therryand Lacarrere, 1983). The shaded profile applies when both shears and buoyancy are active (after Hechtel, 1988).
