Fig. 5.19 100 (a) Relationship between the bulk Richardson number, Ri,  over a layer and the probability (J of turbulence within that layer. 0 This curve was developed empirically. (b) Empirically  denved relationship between i turbulence intensity and the wind speed and shear. N o. indicates none, L is light, M 0. is moderate, oS is severe, and 0 025 10.25 X is extreme turbulence.

Regions where the Richardson number is small are sometimes used as an indicator of the depth of the turbulent SBL. Her we see low Richardson numbers close to the ground, in addition to patches of low Richardson number aloft.;Example of the evolution of local Richardson number with height and time during one night. Regions with Richardson number less than 1.0 are shaded, and are likely to be turbulent. After Mahrt (1981).
