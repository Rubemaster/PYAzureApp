Assume neutral static stability and zero displacement height. 10 O ,!2,34 S,6! M (m5);which the change in roughness occurred. Assume neutral static stability and zero displacement height. 10 O ,!2,34 S,6! M (m5)x;4) Assume a  slab mixed layer of initial depth Zj  100 m, with an initial potential temperature of 280 K. This air is advecting from land to warmer water (water surface effective potential temperature is 290 K) with a mean wind speed of 5 mls. Over land, there is no flux into the bottom of the mixed layer, and no entrainment into the top. Over water, the flux at the bottom can be approximated with a bulk transfer relationship (use Co  2 x 10.3). The flux ratio method can be used to model the entrainment across the top. Neglect subsidence, and assume for simplicity that the strength of the capping inversion is always 2 K. a) Calculate and plot the IBL depth and slab potential temperature as a function of downwind distance, x. b) How does the thickness and temperature at x  I km downwind of the shoreline
