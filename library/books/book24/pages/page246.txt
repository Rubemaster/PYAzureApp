 a (z,t)  TM  Prod.  Loss at (6.8.7 a); a (z,t)  TM  Prod.  Loss at (6.8.7 a)where Prod. and Loss are other production and loss tenns, respectively, given by the conservation equations. The turbulent mixing (flux divergence) tenn, TM. is;(6.8.7b)where YT(z,Z,t) is a transilient rate coefficient (units of s)m) for mixing between level;Z and level z. To help understand YT(z,Z,t), we note that the kinematic mass flux of airmoving from Z6z to z6z is M  II Y(z,Z,t)dz dZ. The top and bottom of the turbulent domain are at zzb and Zt, respectively.;A typical shape for YT (z,Z,t) is shown in Fig 6.13. This graph is similar to a graph of the magnitudes of the Cij elements along anyone row of the transilient matrix, where ij (main diagonal) corresponds to zbO.;Transilient mixing rate coeffiCient, YT, as a function of separation distance between the point of interest (z) and other points (Z) within the turbulent domain.
