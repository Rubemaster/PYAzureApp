13.5.1 Vertical Profiles of Mean Variables and Fluxes;Fig 13.19 shows an idealized composite of vertical profiles of mean variables through a stratocumulus topped mixed layer, in which the cloud and subcloud layers are fully turbulently coupled (Turton and Nicholls, 1987 Rogers and Telford, 1986 Albrecht, et al., 1985 Roach, et al., 1982 Caughey, et al., 1982 Slingo, et al., 1982 Brost, et al., 1982a and Stage and Businger, 1981a).;Fig 13.19 shows an idealized composite of vertical profiles of mean variables through a stratocumulus topped mixed layer, in which the cloud and subcloud layers are fully turbulently coupled (Turton and Nicholls, 1987 Rogers and Telford, 1986 Albrecht, et al., 1985 Roach, et al., 1982 Caughey, et al., 1982 Slingo, et al., 1982 Brost, et al., 1982a and Stage and Businger, 1981a).z z (a);Idealized profiles of mean variables within a stratocumulustopped mixed layer.

(After Turton and Nicholls, 1987 and Ro ers and Telford, 1986).;The equivalent potential temperature and total water mixing ratio are constant with height, supporting the view that the stratocumulus clouds are imbedded within, and are an integral part of, the ML. The virtual potential temperature follows the moist adiabat within the cloud layer, and the liquid water content increases almost linearly with height above cloud base as would be expected if there were no precipitation. Variations in liquid water content (or mixing ratio) are expected due to entrainment of drier air from above. The top of the cloud often has significantly less liquid water than expected, for the same reason. The number density of drops is roughly constant, however, suggesting that the droplets are larger near the top of the cloud. Turbulent flux responses to various imposed forcings are shown in Fig 13.20 (ae), where the solid lines indicate the response for a fully coupled cloud and subcloud BL, and the dashed lines show the response for a cloud layer just recently decoupled from the sUbcloud layer at cloud base. Figs 13.20 a  b show the individual effects of surface heating and entrainment, while Figs 13.20 ce show individual responses to both IR and solar radiation. These individual curves are analogous to the processpartitioning results for TKE production and consumption. For the entrainment curve, it is assumed for the decoupled case that the cloud and subcloud layers are independently turbulent, with entrainment in both directions across the interface at cloud base.
