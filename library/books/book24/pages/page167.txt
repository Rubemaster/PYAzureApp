Equations that are made dimensionless by dividing by scaling parameters are said to be normdized. The nonnalization scheme expressed by (5.2.3) is used in most of the figures in this section. and indeed has been used in the previous chapter too. As is evident in (4.3.1j). the buoyancy tenn acts only on the vertical component of TKE. Hence. this production term is anisotropic (Le . not isotropic). The returnto isotropy terms of (4.3.1hj) are responsible for moving some of the vertical kinetic energy into the horizontal directions. Again. the anisotropic nature of Tenn 1lI confinns our picture of strong up and downdrafts within thermals.;Consumption. In statically stable conditions, an air parcel displaced vertically by turbulence would experience a buoyancy force pushing it back towards its staning height. Static stability thereby tends to suppress, or consume, TKE, and is;Fig. 5.6 MOdeled turbulence kinetic energy budgets at t18 h and t,,02 h during Night 3334, Wangara. After Andre et al. (1978).
