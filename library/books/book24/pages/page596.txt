AlongValley Winds. At night, the cold winds flowing down the valley onto the plains are known as mountain winds or drainage winds. Depths range from 10 to 400 m. depending on the size and flow constrictions of the valley (Neff and King, 1987). Velocities of 18 ms have been observed. and these winds are occasionally intennittent or surging. The return gentle circulation of warmer air aloft is called the antimountain wind, with velocities of about half of the mountain wind, and depths of about twice as much. During the day, warm air gently flowing up the valley axis is known as the valley wind. This wind consists of a valleyfloor component, and sometimes an up incline component along the ridge tops. The cool, slow return flow aloft is called the antivalley wind. Fig 14.4 shows these alongvalley wind components.;Threedimensional Picture. At night, the 3D circulation is fairly easy to picture, with downslope and downvalley winds converging just above the ground, and with gentle upvalley winds and divergence aloft (Fig 14.5a) (McNider and Pielke, 1984). During the moming, the picture is a bit more complicated, with the remaining elevated valley inversion continuing to slide down the valley as a stable core, riding above shallow upvalley and anabatic flows (Fig 14.5b, after Whiteman, 1982). During the afternoon, after the stable core has disappeared, two counterrotating helices are sometimes observed as the wind flows upslope and upvalley at low levels, and descends aloft over the center of the valley (Fig 14.5c).
