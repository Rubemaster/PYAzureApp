Using Cp  0.286, pJp  10080, and rT  O.ot gig, the tenn in square brackets;Using Cp  0.286, pJp  10080, and rT  O.ot gig, the tenn in square bracketsbecomes 0.0642. This yields g z  18,523 m2s2. Combining (13.1.6a) and (13.1.6c) yields an expression for the environmental virtual static energy in tenns of the knowns sL rT, and g z;If we assume for simplicity that gZcloud  gZenviron. then all of the tenns in the above equation are known except T and rsat. But since rsat is a function of T (and p) via Tetens fonnula, we can iteratively solve for the temperature that satisfies (13.1.6e). The solution is T  289.25 K and rsat  14.54 glkg. The virtual static energy in the cloud is thus;Sy Cp T . 1  1.61 rsat  rT )  g Z;Discussion We could have made the problem much simpler by defining our coordinate system such that Z  0 at p  80 kPa. Since both the cloudy and environmental air parcels are at the same height for this problem, the gz tenns would have disappeared. Although this approach is acceptable for detennining relative buoyancy, the magnitudes of the resulting virtual static energies would differ from those usually obtained with a reference height of 100 kPa. Although it was stated earlier that any two of the conserved variables plus the pressure or height are sufficient to solve for any other conserved variable, we see in this example that the solution can be far from trivial. The problem lies in the nonlinear dependency of
