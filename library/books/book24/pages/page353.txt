1) Given the following set of turbulence velocity measurements, fmd the autocorrelation function using both the exact and approximate formulae. These measurements were taken every second 5.5, 6.3, 7.4, 3.3, 3.8, 5.9, 6.1, 5.7, 6.3, 7.1, 4.8, 3.1, 2.1, 2.4, 3.0 Plot this time series and your autocorrelation functions on separate graphs. What is the difference between the exact and approximate autocorrelation curves? 2) Compute the structure function vs lag, for the data of problem 1. Plot and discuss your results. Find the structure function parameter. Discuss the quality of the fit of (8.3.1 b) to this data set. 3) Theoretically prove that if A(t)  sin(t), then R(L)  cos(L). 4) Prove analytically the following relationsfiip between structure function and autocorrelation D(L)  crx2 1R(L). Assume stationary turbulence (i.e., crx2 is constant). 5) Compute the exact autocorrelation and structure function for the following data set, and plot your results for lags from 0 through 180 s. Discuss how the shape of the original time series compares with the peaks in the autocorrelation curve. ill.) I(Q  ill.)

Instead of using a canned FFT package, write your own program or develop a spreadsheet to solve it. Check your results by doing an inverse FFT to reconstruct the data set. Also check to see that the sum of the spectral energies equals the biased variance of the original signal. Compute and plot the spectrum. 7) Compute the discrete Fourier transform for the time series from problem 1, using a canned FFT program. If you solved problem 6, how do your answers compare. 8) Prove mathematically that sine waves of different integer frequencies, n, are orthogonal to each other. By orthogonal, we mean that a wave with one n value cannot be described by a sum of waves with other n values. As an alternative, test the orthogonality with some specific cases. For example, define A(k) as a sine wave with n2. Then see if the discrete Fourier transform of this wave has any energy at n3.
