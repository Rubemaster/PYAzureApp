The EZ can be quite thick  averaging about 40 of the depth of the ML. The top of the entrainment zone is defined as the altitude, h2 of the top of the highest thermal within a region. The bottom, ho is more difficult to define because there is no sharp demarcation. The bottom is usually taken as that altitude where about 5 to 10  (Deardorff, et aI., 1980 Wilde, et aI., 1985) of the air on a horizontal plane has FA characteristics (Fig 11.29a).

The entrainment zone is quite apparentand easily measurable using remote sensors such as lidar (Boers, et aI., 1984 Crum and Stull, 1987). The altitude of the local ML top, shown by the solid line in Fig 11.29a, varies significantly between the EZ top and the middle of the ML. Its shape looks like a series of inverted Us marking the tops of penetrating thermals. The average ML depth, which we traditionally call Zj, is the altitude where 50 of the air has FA characteristics on a horizontal average. Thus, Zj is just below the midpoint between h2 and ho.
