The difference is small, but not negligible. Only when the air is very dry can we neglect the difference.;Problem. Given a temperature of 25C and a mixing ratio of 20 gkg measured at a pressure of 90 kPa (900 mb), find the virtual potential temperature.;S  T (PJP) 0.286  298.16.(10090) 0.286  307.28 K;Sv  S( 1  0.61 r)  307.28 1  0.61(0.020)  311.03 K
