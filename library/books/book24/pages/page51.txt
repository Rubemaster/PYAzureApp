In other words, the average of the local slopes (slope  rate of change with time) equals the slope of the averages (see Fig 2.5).;Fig. 2.5 Schematic comparison of the slope of average values verses the average of local slopes. Averaging period, , is indicated by the width of the horizontal arrows.;forecast of a mean variable such as A using simplified, stochastic, representations of theturbulence. Otherwise, operational forecasts of seemingly simple variables such as temperature or wind would be much more difficult. To summarize the rules of averaging c c
