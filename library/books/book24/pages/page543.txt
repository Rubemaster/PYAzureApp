1983 Heilman and Dobosy, 1985 and Wong, et aI., 1987). For moderate and strong mean winds, opposed slope flows are eliminated. Similar interesting interactions between slope flows and sea breezes can occur when mountains are located near the shore. Fitzjarrald (1984, 1986) found that the diurnal cycle of slope flows and landsea breezes can cause a reversal of the local winds at Veracruz, Mexico. When drainage winds flow out of a valley into a flatter plain, the leading edge behaves like a weak thunderstorm gust front, with a welldefined nose and KH waves along the top of the flow. In measurements of such flows past the BAO tower, Blumen (1984) observed the flow to be about 150 m thick, with peak velocities of 4 mls found below 50 m. The propagation speed of the drainage flow front was estimated to be 2.5 to 3.5 mls.;Using the coordinate system shown in Fig 12.23, Mahrt (1982) has written the equation of motion for downslope component of wind asf V  auw e az au  U au  V au  W au  at ax ay az 60 . g ao hd g  o sm(a)  cos(a)   0 ax (12.7.2a) II III IV V VI VII VIII;f V  auw e az au  U au  V au  W au  at ax ay az 60 . g ao hd g  o sm(a)  cos(a)   0 ax (12.7.2a) II III IV V VI VII VIIIwhere a is the slope angle, hd is the depth of the flow, 60(z) is the potential temperature difference between the ambient air and the colder slope flow, and the average potential temperature depression in the flow is
