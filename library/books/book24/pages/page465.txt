Idealized slab mixed layer, with discontinuous jumps 01 variables at the mixed layer top.de z. I dt we s  we Zi (11.2.3a);de z. I dt we s  we Zi (11.2.3a)with similar equations for humidity and winds. Above the ML the mean variables are assumed to change only by horizontal advection and subsidence. For the sake of completeness, two other governing equations are rewritten here the continuity equation (11.2.2a) and the equation for transport across an interface (7.4.3a);with similar equations for humidity and winds. Above the ML the mean variables are assumed to change only by horizontal advection and subsidence. For the sake of completeness, two other governing equations are rewritten here the continuity equation (11.2.2a) and the equation for transport across an interface (7.4.3a)we Zj;(11.2.3c)where togz8  eZj  aML is the temperature jump across the entrainment zone at the top of the ML. Looking at the geometry of the idealized temperature profile, we expect the temperature jump to decrease as the ML warms, and to increase as entrainment eats upward into the warmer air (Tennekes, 1973);where togz8  eZj  aML is the temperature jump across the entrainment zone at the top of the ML.
