The shape of this profile depends on both the surface flux and the entrainment flux (Fig 11.14). When the entrained flux is negative and the surface flux is positive, as it is for potential temperature, the mean profile of potential temperature is slightly concave to the right, with a stronger negative gradient near the surface and positive gradient near the ML top. For variables such as humidity that often have positive fluxes at both the top and bottom of the ML, the mean humidity profile exhibits a tilt with enhanced curvature at the top and bottom. The ratio of top to bottom fluxes, AR, provides one measure of the overall shape (see Fig 11.14).;Fig. 11.14 Shape of the...erofile of any variable,!. in the mixed layer as a function of fluX ratio, p..  w zJw .
