From our flfSt breath, we spend most of our lives near the earths surface. We feel the warmth of the daytime sun and the chill of the nighttime air. It is here where our crops are grown, our dwellings are constructed, and much of our commerce takes place. We grow familiar with our local breezes and microclimates, and we sense the contrasts when we travel to other places. Such nearearth characteristics, however, are not typical of what we observe in the rest of the atmosphere. One reason for this difference is the dominating influence of the earth on the lowest layers of air. The earths surface is a boundary on the domain of the atmosphere. Transport processes at this boundary modify the lowest tOO to 3000 m of the atmosphere, creating what is called the boundary layer (Fig 1.1). The remainder of the air in the troposphere is loosely called theree atmosphere. The nature of the atmosphere as perceived by most individuals is thus based on the rather peculiar characteristics found in a relatively shallow portion of the air.
