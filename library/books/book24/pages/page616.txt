Sketch of the urban boundary layer and urban plume for a windy (a) day, and (b) night. (After Oke, 1982).;Synoptic and topographic forcings influence the development of the urban boundary layer. The temperature excesses at any given time are modulated by cloudiness. precipitation. and mean ambient wind speed (Ackerman. 1985 McKee. et al . 1987). Local topography such as mountains. lakes and rivers also have a large impact. In Chicago. for example. the greatest temperature excess is often observed in early evening during the late summer. Enhanced urban turbulence at night can create counterrotating vortices on opposite sides of the city (Draxler. 1986). Balling and Cerveny (1987) noted an increase in wind speed over the city at night. which they suggested was due to local urban horizontal temperature gradients and enhanced vertical mixing with the faster flow aloft. During the daytime. heat from the urban area can enhance the mixing already present in the ML. and create an urban internal boundary layer. Hildebrand and Ackerman (1984) and Clarke. et al. (1987) reported enhanced turbulent heat flux. vertical velocity variance. and entrainment rates over urban areas. The ML can sometimes be deeper over urban areas than rural ones because of greater lowlevel convergence. resulting in more cloud condensation nuclei. more thunderstorms and enhanced precipitation immediately downwind of the city (Changnon. 1981). The presence of large buildings increases surface drag and wake turbulence. and decreases the mean wind speed. In the presence of a mean wind. excesses of temperature and pollutants. and deficits of humidity are carrid downwind in an urban plume (Oke. 1982 Hanna. et a!.. 1987).
