Thus, we can write the last term in (4.3.1a) as;J2 a u. , 2vu.  1 ; 2 i(u.2) (au j) V  1  2v J 2 aX. aX. J J;The first term on the right, which physically represents the molecular diffusion of velocity variance, contains the curvature of a variance. The variance changes fairly smoothly with distance within the boundary layer, its curvature being on the order of 10.6;The first term on the right, which physically represents the molecular diffusion of velocity variance, contains the curvature of a variance. The variance changes fairly smoothly with distance within the boundary layer, its curvature being on the order of 10.6s2 in the ML to 10.2 s2 in the SL. When multiplied by V, the first term ranges in magnitude between 1011 and 107 m2 s3. The last term on the right can be much larger. For example, if the eddy velocity changes by only 0.1 mls across a very small size eddy (for example, I cm in diameter), then the instantaneous shear across that eddy is 10 sl. For smaller size eddies, the shear is larger. When this value is squared, averaged, and multiplied by 2v, the magnitudes observed in the turbulent boundary layer range between about 106 and 102 m2 s3. Typical values in the ML are on the order of 104 to 103 m2 s3, while in the surface layer, values on the order of 102 m2 s3 can be found. Thus, we can neglect the first term on the right and use
