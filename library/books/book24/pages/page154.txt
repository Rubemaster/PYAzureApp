(a) Modeled profiles of kinematic heat flux during Night 3334, Wangara symbols as in Fig. 4.3(a) abscissa changes from linear to logarithmic at 10. (b) Range of heat flux normalized by its surface value versus height normalized by boundary layer depth. Based on data from Andr, et al. (1978) and Caughey et al.

Both equations were Reynolds averaged and summed. The turbulent continuity equation was used to put the turbulence diffusion term into flux form. The terms in this equation have analogous meanings as for the moisture flux equation;(4.4.2a). Often, term V is approximated by Oj3 g (616). Term XII describes the;(4.4.2a). Often, term V is approximated by Oj3 g (616). Term XII describes thecorrelation between velocity fluctuations and with radiation fluctuations. Substituting 2 Cui!) for term X, and neglecting the Coriolis, pressure diffusion,
