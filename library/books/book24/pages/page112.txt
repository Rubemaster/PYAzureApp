ML growth stands out, as does the warming of the ML. There is little change in the humidity with time, however. From Figs 3.5ac, we can observe the rate of warming, at any height. This can be compared with the slope of the heat flux profile from Fig 3.2. It is left as an exercise to use (3.5.3f) to see what percentage of the warming within the ML is associated with turbulent flux divergence (convergence) and what percentage is associated with other forcings (radiative, latent heating, advective, etc.). A similar study can be made for moisture, using the specific humidity evolution shown in Figs 3.6ac, and comparing that to the expected moisturizing using the moisture flux profiles of Fig 3.2 along with (3.5.3e). For both moisture and temperature, it is evident that the turbulence term in equations (3.5.3) plays a very impor!lI1t role during daytime conditions over land, when vigorous convective mixing is occurring.
