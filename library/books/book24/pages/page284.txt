(7.5.2a)where r d is the dry adiabatic lapse rate of 9.8 Kkm. If the air is saturated (i.e., if q  qsat) then the change of specific humidity with temperature is given by the Clausius Clapeyron equation;where r d is the dry adiabatic lapse rate of 9.8 Kkm. If the air is saturated (i.e., if q  qsat) then the change of specific humidity with temperature is given by the Clausius Clapeyron equationdqsat e Lvisat dT  (T2) (7.5.2b);dqsat e Lvisat dT  (T2) (7.5.2b)where e  0.622 (gwaler  gait) is the ratio of gas constants for air and water vapor. We can use a variation of Tetens formula (Bolton, 1980) to find Qsat as a function of temperature (Fig. 7.13);Fig. 7.13 Variation of saturation vapor pressure (es.,) and specific humidity (q .. ,) with temperature. for Pl 00 kPa (1000 mb).
