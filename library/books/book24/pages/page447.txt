12) Given the following wind speed and temperature profile data as a function of height from the Kansas field experiment (Izumi, 1971). Use the BusingerDyer flux profilerelationships to find u. and w 6 v  for each of the two different examples (a) and (b).;Previous analyses suggested that Zo  2.4 cm, and the zero plane displacement was about 10 cm, although it would be better if you determined your own values of these parameters from the data below. Note that both parts are difficult, but (b) is more difficult than (a).

Hint, consult recent journals. 15) If you wanted to make ambient nocturnal boundary layer measurements near the surface, but did not want to have your data contaminated by drainage winds, where would you locate your sensor platform? 16) Identify new boundary layer experiments that are not listed in Table 10.1. Hint, consult the literature, especially the Bull. Am. Meteor. Soc. 17) Consult the meteorological literature to determine the current smallest eddy size that can be resolved with numerical simulation models. Would you classify that model as a large eddy simulation model? What order closure was used for the subgrid parameterization?
