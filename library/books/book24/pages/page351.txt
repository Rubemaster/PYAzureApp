This equation was the one referenced in section 5.3, where the relative contributions of the four terms on the right of (8.11.2) were plotted. When integrated over wave numbers from 0 to 00, the result is the TKE equation (5.1b).;Jr(t,lC) d lC, U w   J CP(t,lC) dlC, and E  2v JlC2 S(t,lC) dlC, where the integrals arefrom 0 to 00. The transport term dTr!dlC becomes zero when integrated across the spectrum, because it represents the transport of existing TKE from the low wavenumber portions of the spectrum (where energy is produced) to the high wavenumber regions (where it is dissipated). In the inertial subrange portion of the spectrum where there is neither production nor dissipation, we would expect that the transport across the spectrum, Tr(t,lC) would be equal in magnitude to the total dissipation rate Tr(t, lC)  E. This transport is nothing more than the energy cascade that was introduced early in the text.;Batchelor, G.K., 1953 The Theory of Homogeneous Turbulence. Cambridge Univ. Press, London.
