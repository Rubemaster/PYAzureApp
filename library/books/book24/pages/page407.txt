Use Buckingham Pi dimensional analysis to detenninethe relevant Pi groups. 2) You were recently hired to make background environmental measurements at the site of a proposed power plant. The site happens to be of unifonn roughness in all directions, and the land use in this area does not change with the seasons (i.e., no harvesting, logging, or other changes). a) On one particular overcast day, you measured the following wind speed profile as a function of height using your instrumented 100 m tower and a rawinsonde that you launched Find Zo and u .;the relevant Pi groups. 2) You were recently hired to make background environmental measurements at the site of a proposed power plant.

But your contract with the power company still required you to make background measurements. Therefore, you erected a shorter, 10 m tower at the same site. Then came another overcast day with the wind from the same direction as before. You measured a speed of 4 mls at the top of your short tower. What is value of u. on this day, and what is the wind speed at z  50 m (the height of the proposed smoke stack from the power plant)? 3) If an orchard is planted with 1000 trees per square kilometer, where each tree is 4 m tall and has a vertical crosssection area (effective silhouette to the wind) of 5 m2, what is the aerodynamic roughness length?
