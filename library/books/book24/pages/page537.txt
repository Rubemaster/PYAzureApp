530 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYfor these equations, resulting in linear wave theory. Some real atmospheric waves appear to have many of the characteristics described by linear wave theory, and are called linear waves. Many others do not, and are sometimes called nonlinear waves. If lex ,ICy and ICz are the wavenumbers in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, and f is the local wave frequency observed from a fixed point on the ground, then linear internal waves are described by (Stull, 1976);for these equations, resulting in linear wave theory.
