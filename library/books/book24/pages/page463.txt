Given a sensible heat flux curve such as shown in Fig 11.12b, we know that the amount of heat supplied to the air by time t1 is shown by the area shaded under that curve. Thus, a simple graphical method for estimating ML depth at time t1 is (1) find the area under the heat flux curve up to that time (2) estimate what adiabat under the early morning sounding corresponds to the same amount of heating and (3) determine the ML depth as the height where the adiabat intercepts the morning sounding. This approach for estimating the ML depth is called the thermodynamic method, and it neglects factors such as advection or subsidence which might alter the sounding during the day.;The same result is obtained by neglecting advection, radiation, and latent heating, and then integrating the heat conservation equation (3.5.30 over height and time, and using the chain rule;II 9, J w9.(t) dt J z(9) d9 (11.2.2c);10 66.where z(9) represents the early morning sounding. Knowing t1, this equation can be
