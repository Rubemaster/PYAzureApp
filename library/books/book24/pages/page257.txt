Is it isotropic (in one dimension)? c) Comment on the kind of turbulent boundary layer parameterized by the matrix above? (That is, what is the nature of the turbulence diffusive, convective, other. .. ) d) Given the following initial distribution of pollutant concentration (S, in units of micrograms per cubic meter) at each of six grid points, forecast the concentration at tlO, 20,  30 minutes using a tlO min timestep.

How do you know? d) Does the transilient matrix represent homogeneous turbulence? e) Does the transilient matrix represent isotropic turbulence? 22) If one considers only the momentum equations, how many total equations and unknowns (only of velocity correlations in this case) are there for fourthorder closure? (Hint, look at Table 61.)
