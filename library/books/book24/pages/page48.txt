Time averages are frequently used, and are computed from sensors mounted on a single, fixedlocation platform such as a mast or tower. The relative ease of making observations at a fixed point has meant that time averaging has been the most popular in the lower BL. Some verticallylooking remote sensors also use this method to observe the middle and top of the BL. For turbulence that is both homogeneous and stationary (statistically not changing over time), the time, space and ensemble averages should all be equal. This is called the ergodic condition, which is often assumed to make the turbulence problem more tractable;This book will use the overbar n as an abbreviation for a generic average, not specifying whether it is a time, space, or ensemble average. Because of the popularity of the time average, however, many of our examples will use time as the independent variable.
