Predictability, however, must be split into two categories (1) pattern predictability and (2) statistical results from pattern forecasts. Studies have suggested that individual patterns or structures, whether it be a synopticscale cyclone or a turbulentscale eddy, can be accurately predicted in an Eulerian model out to times no greater than the Lagrangian lifetime of the pattern or structure (Stull, 1985). For example, if we were to take our hypothetical numerical model and initialize it with the exact observed wind field including the precise variations in wind field associated with each of the turbulent eddies present, then we could anticipate forecasting the evolution of those initialized eddies out to about 5 to 15 min for the thermals, but only out to a few seconds for the smallersized eddies. This is pattern or structure predictability. If we continue the forecast beyond the limit of accurately forecast deterministic patterns, then we will continue to generate eddies and thermals in the model, except these eddies will be happening at different times and places with different intensities than the true observed eddies. If the model was designed correctly, then the statistics (TKE,;Fig. 10.4 Vertical crosssection of the resolvablegcv nfae V layer at Wangara. The mean values have been removed.
