A similar double exponential pdf describes the distribution of LCLs. By integrating over both pdfs for the entrainment zone and the LCL zone, we can determine the cloud cover of forced clouds from the total probability of finding thermals above their LCLs (Wilde, et aI., 1985); f pdf(z) f pdf(ZuL) dZLCL dZj (13.3.3);To forecast coverage of active and passive clouds, one must develop prognostic equations such as those by ogers, et al. (1985a).;Lopez (1977) demonstrated that many cloud attributes, such as diameter and depth, are distributed log normally. Examples of observed cloud size distributions are shown in Fig 13.14, along with the best fit lognormal curve (Stull, 1984). We see that the diameters and depths of most clouds cluster together, but there is a small percentage of clouds that are much larger.
