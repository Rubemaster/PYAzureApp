Let qT be the total specific humidity of air namely, the mass of water (all phases) per unit mass of moist air. The conservation of water substance can be written, assuming incompressibility, asoqT U OqT i S  v.i  IT (3.2.4a) at j ax. q a 2 Pair J Xj;II VI VIIwhere Vq is the molecular diffusivity for water vapor in the air. SqT is a net moisture source term (sources  sinks) for the remaining processes not already included in the equation. Its units are mass of total water per unit volume per unit time. By splitting the total humidity into vapor (q) and nonvapor (qJ parts using qT  q  qL and SqT  Sq  SlL (3.2.4a) can be rewritten as a pair of coupled equations;where Vq is the molecular diffusivity for water vapor in the air.

The convergence of falling liquid or solid water (e.g., precipitation) that is not advecting with the wind is included as part of term VII. It has been assumed in (3.2.4c) that molecular diffusion has a negligible effect on liquid and solid precipitation or cloud particles. Terms I, II, and VI are analogous to the corresponding terms in the momentum equation. Term VII is a net body source term, and term VIII represents the conversion of solid or liquid into vapor.;3.2.5 Conservation of Heat (First Law of Thermodynamics)
