Tenn II is sometimes called the geostrophic departure tenn, because it is zero when the actual winds are geostrophic. As we stated before, however, the winds are rarely geosttophic in the BL. Tenn III describes viscous shear stress.;Combined Momentum Equation. Combining the results from the previous two subs.ections yields;Combined Momentum Equation.

Those same variables, however, usually exhibit a much smaller horizontal variation over the same I to 2 kIn scale. Counteracting this disparity of gradients is a disparity of velocities. Namely, V and V are often on the order of mls while
