If the humidity is low in the afternoon, then 12 h later it is more humid. On the average, humidity is negatively correlated with itself 12 h later. Over a 24 h period, however, like comparing a morning humidity with the next mornings humidity, or the afternoon humidity with the next afternoons humidity, we anticipate a positive correlation.;opposite side of its oscillation.

For lags greater than 48h the autocorrelation is not statistically reliable.;The initial drop off of the autocorrelation from 1.0 to smaller values is a measure of the accuracy of a persistence forecast. Namely, if we forecast the humidity 3 or less hours from now to be the same as the present humidity, we would probably be close to correct because the autocorrelation is 60 or higher. Longer forecn s t would be less accurate.
