(After Caughey, et al., 1983 and Deardorff and Willis, 1985.z  ;Although not plotted here, temperature histograms show negatively skewed frequency distributions in the ML, which change to symmetric distributions in the entrainment lone, similar to those of vertical velocity. Ioint probability distributions showing the relative frequency of vertical velocities and temperature fluctuations are shown in Fig 11.20 (Mahrt and Paumier, 1984 Deardorff and
