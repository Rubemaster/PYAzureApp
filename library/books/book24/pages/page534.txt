Strata of strong echo returns revealed in a sodar record made at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory on 11 September 1983. Dark portions of the record denote heighttime intervals of strong echo returns that are perhaps turbulent. Gravity waves propagating through the planetary boundary layer perturb these strata and produce the undulations. (After Hooke and Jones. 1986).;Fig 12.20 shows the variation of BruntViiisiilii frequency as a function of height for the 0300 local time potential temperature sounding plotted in Fig 12.12. Higher stabilities near the surface support a larger range of frequencies than those higher in the SBL. In a residual layer of neutral stratification, vertically propagating waves are not supported, and their amplitude is damped with height within the RL. Waves that propagate upward within the SBL eventually reach a level where their frequency matches the ambient Brunt V1iisiilii frequency, at which point they reflect back down toward the ground. Waves are thus trapped between the ground and the neutral layers aloft, resulting in horizontally propagating waves and modal oscillations only, as shown in Figure 12.19. Wave periods (21tfrequency) ranging from less than a minute to 40 min have been reported, depending on the stability. Fig 12.19 shows waves with periods between 1 and 10 minutes.
