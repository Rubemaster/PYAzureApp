Clouds can fonn at the top of mixed layers. and at the bottom of stable boundary layers. The amount and distribution of short and longwave radiative flux divergence in the boundary layer are altered by clouds. and these effects are emerging as important aspects of the climatechange problem. In addition. the radiative effects combine with latent heating to modulate BL dynamics. turbulence generation. and evolution. This chapter provides a brief review of cloud thennodynamics. radiative processes. the role of entrainment. and descriptions of fogs. cumulus and stratocumulus clouds.;Set sL. ses) are similar to the respective potential temperatures (e. e v , ee. e L ees) However. static energies are based on the assumption that any kinetic energy is locally dissipated into heat. while the potential temperatures do not utilize that assumption. Static energies have units of m2s2, or equivalently Jkg. Typical magnitudes for static energies in the boundary layer are 3 x lOS Jkg. By expressing static energies in units of kJkg, the resulting values are on the order of 300 kJkg. This helps to reinforce its analogy with potential temperature, which is typically on the order of 300 K.
