Table 62. Correlation triangles indicating the unknowns for various levels of turbulence closure, lor the momentum equations only. Notice the pattern in these triangles, with the u, v, and w statistics at their respective vertices, and the cross correlations in between.;To make the mathematicaVstatistical description of turbulence tractable, one approach is to use only a finite number of equations, and then approximate the remaining unknowns in terms of known quantities. Such closure approximations or closure assumptions are named by the highest order prognostic equations that are retained. U sing the equations in Table 61 as an example, for firstorder closure the first equation is retained and the second moments are approximated. Similarly, second order closure retains the first two equations, and approximates terms involving third moments. Some closure assumptions utilize only a portion of the equations available within a particular moment category. For example, if equations for the turbulence kinetic energy
