(8.2.la)where two different mean values are used depending on which portion of the whole series is being considered;and  1 I A   A kj Nj kj kOand where lag  L  j 6t. Notice that each of the square bracket tenns in the denominator acts like a standard deviation over the portion of the data set being used. We can approximate (S.2.1a) if it is assumed that the data is sufficiently stationary (or homogeneous for space series) that the mean values over each portion of the series is equal to the overall series mean, and that the standard deviations from each ponion equal the overall series standard deviation. Thjs results in;This simple approximation works satisfactorily for small lags (i.e., small j) and large N, but is inadequate otherwise. Autocorrelations are usually calculated for a range of lags, and the result plotted on a graph of RAA vs L. For the special case of zero lag, the autocorrelation is identically equal to unity RAA(O)  1.0 for all signals. The autocorrelation of an irregular signal such as turbulence approaches zero as L approaches infinity, although it may appear as damped oscillations about zero while L is small. Also, as the lag increases, the percentage of the time series used to calculate RAA(L) decreases. As a result, the statistical significance of RAA decreases as lag increases, making RAA unrepresentative when j  (N!2). Sample autocorrelation curves for convective turbulence measured at different heights in the ML are shown in Fig S.1 (Deardorff and Willis, 1985).
