This can be derived from the logwind profile, which is reviewed in Chapter 9. For oceans, (7A.li) can be combined with Charnocks relationship to give;.4  CON  404 x 10 M O.SS (7A.lj);.4  CON  404 x 10 M O.SS (7A.lj)which yields a surface stress of;2 4  u.  404 x 10 M 2.5S (7A.lk);Fig 7.8 shows how these relationships compare to observations of stress and drag over the oceans and over ice. Occasionally, numerical modelers use constant drag values for simplicity, such as the value of CON  1.5 x 10,3 based on 10 m winds suggested by Anthes  Keyser (1979). Typical values for CON and Coover land are listed in Table 73.;10 M,o (mJs ) Variation of neutral drag coelficieQj over (a) ocean. and (b) ice. as a function of wind speed at 10 m (M,o) Shaded areas indicate ranle of data.
