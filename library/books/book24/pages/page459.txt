The flux at the bottom is usually specified as aboundary condition, while the flux at the top can be found from w  we(z .   if 1 the entrainment velocity is known. To complete this set of equations we need the continuity equation, which depends on the evolution of the ML described next.;Phases. Growth of the ML depth during a diurnal cycle is often a 4phase process (1) Formation of a shallow ML, which slowly deepens (2) Rapid ML growth (3) Deep ML of nearly constant thickness (4) Decay of turbulence Fig 11.10 shows an example of the first three phases as measured by a groundbased Iidar (Wilde, et aI., 1985). During the early morning the mixed layer is shallow, starting with a depth on the order of tens of meters for calm situations to depths of a couple hundred meters for windier situations. Its depth increases slowly at first because of the strong nocturnal stable layer that caps the young ML. This first phase is sometimes referred to as the burning off of the nocturnal inversion.
