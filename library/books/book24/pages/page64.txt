W  0 throughout most of the boundary layer. As a result, the vertical advective fluxesare usually negligible compared to the vertical turbulent fluxes. No such statement can be made about the horizontal fluxes, where strong mean horizontal winds and strong turbulence can cause fluxes of comparable magnitudes. Finally, it is important to note that turbulence in the real atmosphere usually consists of many large positive and negative values of the instantaneous fluxes, such as heat flux;are usually negligible compared to the vertical turbulent fluxes.

Only after averaging does a smaller, but significant, net flux we become;we. Only after averaging does a smaller, but significant, net flux we becomeapparent. An example of the instantaneous heat flux values measured by an aircraft flying near the ground during the 1983 Boundary Layer Experiment (BLX83, see Stull  Eloranta,;1984) is shown in Fig. 2.13.

Occasional large positive spikes associated withconvective plumes cause the net average value of we to be positive for this case. Figs;2.14 show the corresponding histograms of frequency of occurrence of w, e, and we. The aircraft was flying at about 75 mis, so it is easy to convert the time axis of Fig 2.13 to a distance axis.

During the daytime, the fluxes are large, and usually change linearly with height over the ML. At night, the fluxes are much weaker.
