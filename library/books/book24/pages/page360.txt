Step 5. Form dimensionless equations of the remaining variables in terms of the key variables. Example t  (p)a (D)b (U)C;Step 6. Solve for the powers a, b, c, . . . to yield dimensionally consistent equations. Example Solve each equation independently. For the fIrst equation;Step 6. Solve for the powers a, b, c, . . . to yield dimensionally consistent equations. Example Solve each equation independently. For the fIrst equationt  (p)8 (D)b (U)C;t  (p)8 (D)b (U)Cor M LI T2  (M L3)8 (L)b (L rl)c or M LI r2  M8 L38it T The dimensions on the left hand side must equal the dimensions on the right. Thus M 1 a L 1  3ahc T 2  c These three equations can be solved for the three unknowns, yielding a1 bO c2 Thus, a dimensionally consistent equation is t  (p)1 (D)o (U)2, or t  p U2 . Similarly, we fInd that d  1, e  1, f  1 yielding 1.1  P U D. Also g  0, h  1, i  0 yielding Zo  D .;Step 7. For each equation, divide the left hand side by the right hand side to give dimensionless (Pi) groups. The number of Pi groups will always equal the number of variables minus the number of dimensions. Example;Step 7. For each equation, divide the left hand side by the right hand side to give dimensionless (Pi) groups. The number of Pi groups will always equal the number of variables minus the number of dimensions. Examplex  I lL. pUD;Step 8. (Optional) If desired, alternative Pi groups can be formed from the ones derived in the previous step, as long as the total number of Pi groups does not change, all variables are represented, and no one Pi group can be formed from any combination of the remaining groups. Example One alternative set of Pi groups might be XI, X4 (1tzx3), Xs (IX3) This new set is
