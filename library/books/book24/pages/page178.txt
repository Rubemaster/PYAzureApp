Term N in the TKE budget (S.l) involves the production of TKE by interaction of turbulence with the mean wind. One might expect that the production of TKE is accompanied by a corresponding loss of kinetic energy from th mean flow. To study that possibility, start with the prognostic equation for mean wind in turbulent;Term N in the TKE budget (S.l) involves the production of TKE by interaction of turbulence with the mean wind. One might expect that the production of TKE is accompanied by a corresponding loss of kinetic energy from th mean flow. To study that possibility, start with the prognostic equation for mean wind in turbulentflow (3.4.3c), multiply by U j ,and use the chain rule to derive the following equation for 2 .2 .2  2 mean kinetic energy per unit mass MKEm  O.5(U  V  W )  0.5 Uj ;U  d2U .(IiU    j dP  j  U j j)  gi3U ,  fe3U, U.  vU.

This confmns our observation that Coriolis force can neither create nor destroy energy it merely redirects the winds.
