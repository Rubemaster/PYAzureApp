Equations (12.6.2) show that linear waves are detenninistic we can solve for the wave perturbation displacement. vertical velocity. etc. at any location at any time. This is unlike turbulence. where equations (3.5.3) forecast only the statistics of the perturbations. Furthermore. simple sine and cosine functions describe the waves. By looking in time series records for simple sinusoidal oscillations. we can identify linear waves. Linear waves can transport momentum and kinetic energy vertically. but they can not transport heat or other scalars. For example. (12.6.2a) shows that a and w are 900 out of phase. because one is a sine function and the other is a cosine function. When the product aw is averaged over an integer number of wave periods. the result (i.e . the heat flux) is identically zero.;Nonlinear Waves and Turbulence. Finnigan. et al. (1984) show how analyses of time series data can be extended to include both waves and turbulence. Split any variable. . into three parts the mean. wave. and turbulence components;The mean is defined by the usual time average (2.4.1a). A phase averaging operator   can be defined as;C,  lim (  f (t  k JP) ) N k  1 (l2.6.2d);C,  lim (  f (t  k JP) ) N k  1 (l2.6.2d)where JP is the time period of the wave of interest. The wave component can then be found from;Knowing both the mean and wave components. these can be subtracted from the instan taneous value to yield the remaining turbulent part from (12.6.2c). The above technique can be used to analyze the wave and turbulence components of an observed time series. The set of averaging rules for this situation is an extension of the Reynolds averaging rules (Finnigan. et aI., 1984);a b  a b i b  ab    C,  ab  0 ab  0 (12.6.2f)
