Fig. 3.3 (a) Kinematic heat flux (we) and moisture flux (WPv ) at various heights measured by aircraft during flight 13, June 14, of the 1983 Boundary Layer Experiment (BLX83) in Oklahoma, where p. is the water vapor density (g wal.r m 3.,r). Ib) Same data as (a), but normalized with respect to the top of the mixed ayer (Zl) with respect to surface values of the fluxes. The buoyancy flux ( we.) is also plotted.;ML can increase substantially during that time interval. To remove these effects, micrometeorologist often normalize their plots. Height is normalized by dividing by the depth of the ML, Zj. Flux is normalized by the concurrent surface value of flux observed (or estimated). The resulting normalized flux profiles are shown in Figs 3.1 b  3.3b. In addition, the buoyancy flux we is shown. The buoyancy flux has much less scatter than the other fluxes. It is largest at the surface, and decreases linearly with height in the ML. Figs 3.4ac show the estimated evolution of the potential temperature profile for the three cases (Crum, et al., 1987). Each data point corresponds to a flightleg average. The two profiles shown for flight 3 were started near the surface, and each ended an hour later above the top of the ML. Thus, the warming that took place during each hour contaminates the profiles, causing them to appear tilted. The top of each profile is tilted towards the warmer tempeartures. Just the opposite tilt is observed for the flight 13, because the flights above the top of the ML were nown first. In spite of these tilts, it is obvious that the ML becomes warmer and deeper with time. Better examples of ML evolution for flight 3 are shown in Figs 3.5 and 3.6. The data set in these figures was taken while the aircraft climbed or descended, thereby making soundings. Given typical descent rates of the aircraft, measurements were made with about 0.5 m resolution in the vertical (extremely high resolution soundings).
