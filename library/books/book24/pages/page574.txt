Soong and Ogura (1980) determined that cumulus clouds tend to respond rapidly to changes in largescale forcings, and can be assumed to be in a state of quasiequilibrium. Betts (1973) suggests that vertical fluxes associated with cumulus convection can be parameterized using the concept of a convective mass lux, ro, where;little effect on the buoyancy profile.

The fluxes of any conserved variable, S, can be written asws roO (Sup  S) (13.4.5a) 1  0 cA;ws roO (Sup  S) (13.4.5a) 1  0 cAwS ro  (Sup  Sdown) (13.4.5b);wS ro  (Sup  Sdown) (13.4.5b)where subscripts up and down represent the updraft and downdraft portions of the cloud circulation, and the overbar represents a horizontal average over both cloud and environmental air. Penc and Albrecht (1987) find that this convective mass flux approach also works fairly well for stratocumulus clouds, where they estimate roO  0.1 mls near the base of the cloud, decreasing slightly with height for the cases they examined.
