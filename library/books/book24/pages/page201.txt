TKE dissipation rate. Within the buoyancy subrange sketched below, would you expect turbulence to be isotropic? (Hint, buoyancy effects are important in a statically stable environment.);9) a) Rewrite the conservation equation for mean kinetic energy in terms of the geostrophic wind.b) Suppose that uw   0.05 m2 s2 and auaz  5 sl and V  0 within the;b) Suppose that uw   0.05 m2 s2 and auaz  5 sl and V  0 within thesurface layer. If there are no pressure gradients, then what is the value of the rate of change of mean kinetic energy, and what does it mean concerning the change in mean wind speed during a 1 minute period? 10) On the planet Krypton suppose that turbulent motions are affected by a strange form of viscosity that dissipates only the vertical motions. How would the TKE be affected? 11) What is the Reynolds stress? Why is it called a stress? How does it relate to u? 12) Define the following types of convection. Under what weather conditions is each type of convection most likely? What term in the TKE equation is small under each condition? a) Free convection b) Forced convection.;13) Given the term U. a( 1.. y2)1ax., which represent the advection of total horizontal v J 2 J component of kinetic energy. Expand the variables Uj and Y into mean and turbulent pans, Reynolds average, and simplify as much as possible. 14) Observations z(m) 12 8 2 O.Izo 9 (K)
