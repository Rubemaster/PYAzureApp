Typical values range from 10 to 100 m. The inverse of the wavelength at the peak in the spectrum of fSw(f) can also be used to define a length scale (Hunt, et aI., 1985). Typical values are 10 to 50 m. Another length scale, already reviewed in Chapter 9, is the local Obukhov length, LL (Nieuwstadt, 1984). Typical values range from zero to 50 m it usually approaches zero as height increases. In the case of strong contiguous turbulence, the Obukhov length based on surface fluxes can be used instead. A variety of mixinglength scales have be used successfully to model the SBL, because of the absence of large eddies (Estournel and Guedalia, 1987 Lacser and Arya, 1986 and Delage, 1974). For example, Delages (1974) suggestion was;.!.  1  fc  lL 1 k z 0.0004 G k  (12.2.3f);.!.  1  fc  lL 1 k z 0.0004 G k  (12.2.3f)where 13 is an empirical parameter. Additional parameterizations are a function of the Richardson number.;ContinuousContiguous Turbulence. Cooling rates and heat fluxes for a couple of cases are shown in Fig 12.7. Unlike the corresponding radiation figure, the variation of heat flux and cooling rate from case to case varies so widely that it is useless to show the whole possible range on one figure. Given a turbulent heat flux into the bottom of the
