0.02 1s and a lapse rate of 0.012 KIm at a height of 20 m above ground. calculate the value of the heat flux at that height using Busingers fluxprofile relationships. Assume a mean potential temperature of 21C. To simplify your calculations. recall that zL is approximately equal tothe Richardson number for unstable conditions. 12) State some reasons why one might need to use geostrophic drag relationships. 13) Use the definition of the drag coefficient along with the neutral log wind profile equation to prove that CON  k2 In2(zzo) .;14) Given the definition for eddy diffusivity u w   K CJVCJz. solve for K as a function of height in the neutral surface layer. assuming a log wind profile. 15) Given the answer from the previous question. and the defi.1ition for Ekman layer depth hE  (2 1t2 Klfc)l2  show that the Ekman layer depth is proportional to uJfc. 16) Given the following variables and their dimensions z height L gle buoyancy parameter L T2 Kl TKE turbulence KE per unit mass L2 T2 Zi depth of the mixed layer L we surface kinematic heat flux L Tl K Perform a dimensional analysis to find Pi groups for z and TKE. using the remaining variables as the primary variables. 17) Using the BusingerDyer fluxprofile relationship for statically stable conditions a) Derive an equation for the drag coefficient.
