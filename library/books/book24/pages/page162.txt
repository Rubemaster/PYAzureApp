The momentum;production or loss tenn depending on whether the heat flux u.9  is I v positive (during daytime over land) or negative (at night over land), is a mechanical or shear productionloss term. The momentumflux u.u. is usually of opposite sign from the mean wind shear, I J because the momentum of the wind is usually lost downward to the ground. Thus, Tenn IV results in a positive contribution to TKE when multiplied by a negative sign. Term V represents the turbulent transport of TKE. It describes how TKE is moved around by the turbulent eddies uf Tenn VI is a pressure correlation term that describes how TKE is redistributed by pressure perturbations. It is often associated with oscillations in the air (buoyancy or gravity waves). Tenn VII represents the viscous dissipation of TKE i.e., the conversion of TKE into heat.; (,) 1 (wp) ,, au d. wed. u w az az  p az  e (5.lb);Turbulence is dissipative. Tenn VII is a loss tenn that always exists whenever TKE is nonzero. Physically, this means that turbulence will tend to decrease and disappear with time, unless it can be generated locally or transported in by mean, turbulent, or pressure processes. Thus, TKE is not a conserved quantity. The boundary layer can be turbulent only if there are specific physical processes generating the turbulence. In the next subsections, the role of each of the tenns is examined in more detail.
