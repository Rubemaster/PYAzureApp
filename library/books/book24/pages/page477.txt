MIXED LAYER 469ambient wind shear. Other studies have suggested that secondary circulations such as rolls develop whenever an inflection point occurs in the mean wind profile. For example, the Ekman spiral solution always has an inflection point near the top of the Ekman layer. Over the ocean, roll patterns and cloud streets gradually change to cellular patterns further downwind in a cold air advection situation. These are evident as honeycomb cloud patterns visible by satellite. This pattern is caused by mesoscale cellular convection (MCC, not to be confused with mesoscale convective complex). Open cells consists of hexagonal rings of updraft and clouds around clear central areas of downdraft, while closed cells are clear rings of descending air around mesoscale cloud clusters and updrafts. Cells typically have diameters on the order of 10 to 100 km, but are nevertheless boundary layer phenomena. Cells have depths on the order of 2 to 3 km, yielding aspect ratios of about 10 1 to 30 1 (Agee, et aI., 1973 Rosmond, 1973 Lenschow and Agee, 1976 Sheu and Agee, 1977 Agee, 1984 Rothermel and Agee, 1980, 1986 Ray 1986). The cellular pattern is reminiscent of laboratory Rayleigh.Benard convection cells, except that the laboratory convection has an aspect ratio of about 1 1. These laboratory cells are well explained by the Rayleigh number, Ra;Ra (11.2.5a)for nonturbulent flow, where 9 is the potential temperature difference across the convective layer of depth h, and where molecular viscosity, v, and thermaldiffusivity. ve. dominate. Many attempts have been made to define a turbulent Rayleigh number (using eddy diffusivities in place of the molecular ones) that would work for the atmosphere (Rothermel and Agee, 1986 Chang and Shirer. 1984 Fiedler. 1984). Although investigators have been able to numerically simulate some of the characteristics of MCC. they were often forced to make rather arbitrary choices for some of the model parameters. Frequently, the parameterization requires a rather large value of eddy diffusivity in the range of 20 to 2000 m2sl. Ray (1986) has suggested that horizontal variability of K is necessary to explain MCC.;When pollutants are emitted at the bottom of the mixed layer they are quickly drawn by the convergence zones into the rising updraft, causing the center of mass of the tracer to initially move slightly above 0.5Zj as it drifts downwind (Fig 11.26a). Pollutants emitted above the surface layer move downward on the average (Fig 1 1. 26b) because downdrafts comprise a larger area than updrafts. and because the updraft air is quickly recycled back down (Willis and Deardorff, 1976. 1978. 1981). Eventually. the pollutants become
