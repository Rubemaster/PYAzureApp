Solution to 3. In each term is the same unrepeated index, m. Thus, this equation represents three equations;Problem 4, demonstrating all rules One form of the equation of motion is written here in summation notation. For now, just acceprtTiis equation as a given example we will discuss the physics of it in more detail in the next chapter. This equation employs repeated and nonrepeated indices, the Kronecker delta, the alternating unit tensor, and the stress tensor t (to be discussed in the next section). Let both A and B represent velocities. This is quite a complex example, which you should study carefully;Problem 4, demonstrating all rules One form of the equation of motion is written here in summation notation.
