For the special case of no liquid water in the air, this reduces tow9 y   (w9) 1 0.6Ir  0.619 (wr) ( 4.4.5d);(4.4.5a). Knowing av , it is easy to then find av and av, as is done with any other;(4.4.5a). Knowing av , it is easy to then find av and av, as is done with any othervariable. The resulting flux found by forming the product of w and 9v yields a more accurate virtual potential temperature flux than (4.4.5c or d). Case study examples for the buoyancy flux were shown in Figs 3.13.3.;Andre, I.C.,G. De Moor, P. Lacarrere, G.
