4.3.4 A Scalar Quantity (Tracer Concentration Variance);Analogous with the moisture equation, start with (4.1.4), multiply by 2c, use the product rule of calculus, Reynolds average, put into flux form, neglect molecular diffusion but retain the molecular dissipation, and rearrange to yield;.., ,2 ..,2 ,C QC  U.

J J II IV;The terms above have physical representations analogous to those in (4.3.2).;The equations of section 3.5.3 contain divergence terms of turbulent fluxes (e.g.,;UjUj, u9, ujq, and ujc). These fluxes are unknowns in equations (3.5.3). If;UjUj, u9, ujq, and ujc). These fluxes are unknowns in equations (3.5.3). Ifprognostic equations for the fluxes can be found, one hopes that there will be as many equations as unknowns, allowing determination of the boundary layer wind and turbulence state. In this section, we will derive equations for the unknown fluxes unfortunately, these new equations will contain additional new unknowns.;Budget Equations. Two perturbation equations are combined to produce flux equations. To obtain the frrst equation, start with (4.1.1), multiply it by Uk , and Reynolds average au. au.  u u 1  uku.2  k j a J ax. Xj J;For the second equation, interchange the i and k indices (Le., replace each occurrence of i with k. and each occurrence of k with i). Such an interchange will not change the meaning of the equation, because summed terms will continue to be summed, and unsummed terms will continue to represent the three components. The result is
