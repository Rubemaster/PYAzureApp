478 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYmorning ML, when the ML turbulence is strong and the capping inversion is weak. Typical values, however, are often in the range of we  0.01 to 0.20 mls. As mentioned earlier, we must make an assumption to close the ML equations. This assumption can be in the form of a parameterization for the entrainment velocity, or a parameterization for any of the other unknowns in the set of equations (11.2.3ad). Obviously, if assumptions are made for the other unknowns, then the entrainment velocity can be calculated from the other knowns. The following sections describe some of these closure assumptions. The thermodynamic method (Section 11.2.2) is not described here because it is a direct calculation of ML depth, without really using entrainment velocities. Of course, the thermodynamic methods works only during free convection, and fails whenever mechanical generation of turbulence dominates.; we v  (11.4.2a) we v s;Most of the suggested values of AR range between 0.1 to 0.3, with AR  0.2 being a good average to use for free convection (Stull, 1976a). When humidities are low such that potential temperature and virtual potential temperature are approximately equal, (11.4.2a) is often written in terms of the heat flux. When (11.4.2a) is used in an expression analogous to (11.2.3c) but for virtual potential temperature, we find that the entrainment velocity is;A we R v s (11.4.2b);Almost all of the entrainment parameterizations have this same fundamental form entrainment is proportional to some measure of the turbulence or external turbulence forcing, and is inversely proportional to the virtual potential temperature jump across the top of the ML. Stronger capping inversions reduce entrainment, while stronger surface buoyancy flux increases entrainment.
