In the real atmosphere, however, there are occasions where transport appears to flow UP the gradient (Le., countergradient). As it turns out, this is physically explained by the fact that there are large eddies associated with rise of warm air parcels that transport heat from hot to cold, regardless of the local gradient of the background environment. Thus, in an attempt to make smalleddy Ktheory work in largeeddy convective boundary layers, one must resort to negative values of K. Since this results in heat flowing from cold to hot, it is counter to our commonsense concept of diffusion. Thus, Ktheory is not recommended for use in convective mixed layers. There has been no lack of creativity by investigators in designing parameterizations for K. Table 64 lists some of the parameterizations for K that have appeared in the literature (Bhumralkar, 1975), and Fig 6.2 show a typical variation of K with height in the boundary layer. Variations of K in the horizontal have also been suggested to explain phenomena such as mesoscale cellular convection (Ray, 1986).;Fig. 6.2 Typical variation of eddy viscosity, K, with height in the boundary layer.
