By averaging over a series of horizontal planes, we can compute mean vertical profiles of various variables. For areaaveraged turbulence statistics such as TKE or fluxes, the subgrid parameterized component must be added to the resolvablescale values to yield the total value at any height. Such area averages are analogous to area averages produced from remote sensor output, assuming the sensor can scan a volume. In a similar way, statistics can be found by volumeaveraging over limited subolumes of the domain. These volume averages are more closely related to the volume averages of real data that to the ensemble averages discussed in Chapter 2.;Convective Mixed Layer. Figs lOA and 5 show examples of vertical and horizontal cross sections through Deardorffs LES model, where resolvablescale turbulent structures that look like thermals are revealed. Fig 10.6 shows Moengs (1984b) simulation of thermal updrafts in a convective boundary layer, while Fig 10.7 shows an analysis of the temperature structure of thermals. It is obvious that these models forecast pseudorandom turbulent structures in both spaceand time. In fact, the variation of temperature or velocity with time at anyone grid point within the turbulent domain would exhibit a trace similar to Fig 2.1. An example of the areaaveraged mean potential temperature, humidity, and TKE profiles are shown in Fig 10.8. Many of the figures in Chapters 35 are composites of real data with numerical simulations, because the simulations filled in the gaps that were not (or could not be) measured in the field.;Fig. 10.7 The 302.1 K isentropic surface in a LES showing thermals of warm air rising through a convective ML up toward a warm capping inversion.
