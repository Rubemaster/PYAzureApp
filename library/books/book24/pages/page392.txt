This ratio equals 0.74 in neutral conditions. The curves corresponding to the above equations are plotted in Fig 9.9b. It is often assumed that the flux profile relationships for moisture or pollutants are equal to those for heat.;Z r  Z    L (a) Range of dimensionless wind shear observations In the surface layer, plotted with interpolation formulas.
