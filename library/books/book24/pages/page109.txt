May 27. of the 1983 Boundary Layer Experiment (BLX83) in Oklahoma, where Pv is the water vapor density (g wa,.r mi r ). (b) Same data as (a). but normalized with respect to the top of the mixed layer (Zi) with respect to surface values of the fluxes. The buoyancy flux (we) is also plotted.;An FFT (Fast Fourier Transfonn) filter was used to eliminate all wavelengths longer than 6.25 km. from these space series. This was necessary to reduce the effect of unresolved long (mesoscale) waves that would otherwise contaminate the data. The resulting filtered values were used to calculate kinematic fluxes wT and wq using the eddy correlation method (i.e., the method of exercise (2) in section 2.12 also see chapter 10). Thus, the averages are line (spatial) averages, not time averages. Although each level flight leg took less than 5 min to fly, the many legs making up anyone flight took from 2 to 4 hours to complete. The following table list the flight times, where CDT denotes Central Daylight Time (COT  UTe  5 h);Table 31.
