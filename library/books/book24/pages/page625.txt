Scaling variables are used in similarity theory to nondimensionalize other variables. The following tables summarize length. velocity. time. temperature and humidity scales. Detailed discussions of these variables and their applications are presented in the body of this book. See Appendix B for definitions of notation.;Sometimes. the ratio of terms from an equation has significance concerning the nature of turbulence in the boundary layer. For example. if one term represents the suppression of turbulence and another term represents the generation of turbulence, then the ratio of these two terms might give an indication of the existence of turbulence or its intensity. The ratio of such terms defines a dimensionless group. The following tables present many of the dimensionless groups that are used in boundary layer meteorology.
