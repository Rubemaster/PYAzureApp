Problem B Suggest parameterizations to close the set of equations (6.4.1a).;Discussion If these equations are plugged back into (6.4.1a), then there are 3;Discussion If these equations are plugged back into (6.4.1a), then there are 3equations for the 3 unknowns e, U, and V. This is a closed set which can be solved numerically if the K values are known. Although the assumption that Keonstant is an easy assumption, it is the least realistic. It would be better to parameterize K as a;equations for the 3 unknowns e, U, and V. This is a closed set which can be solved numerically if the K values are known. Although the assumption that Keonstant is an easy assumption, it is the least realistic. It would be better to parameterize K as afunction of the knowns e, U, and V, or of gradients of those knowns.;But aeax  0 for a horizontally homogeneous environment. Thus u 9  O.;Discussion It makes no difference whether KH is positive, negative or exceptionally large. Ktheory will always yield zero flux in a uniform environment, regardless of the true flux.;As we saw in Section 2.9.3, the molecular stress tmol can be approximated by tmol ;As we saw in Section 2.9.3, the molecular stress tmol can be approximated by tmol p v i)UIi)z for a Newtonian fluid. By analogy, one might expect that the turbulent Reynolds stress can be also expressed in terms of the shear, with a corresponding change;p v i)UIi)z for a Newtonian fluid. By analogy, one might expect that the turbulent Reynolds stress can be also expressed in terms of the shear, with a corresponding changefrom molecular viscosity v to eddy viscosity Krn, yielding tReynolds  P Krn aUaz.;Dividing this latter expression by p gives the kinematic form (6.4.1 b). The product pKrn is sometimes called the Auslausch coefficient.
