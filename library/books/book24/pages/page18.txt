But the total derivative is defined by d!dt  d!dt  U d!dX  V d!dy  W!dZ. Thus, the general form of Taylors hypothesis is;K  flM (lAc)where K  21t().., and f  21tP, for wavelength A. and wave period lP (Wyngaard and Clifford, 1977). The dimensions of K are radians per unit length, while f has dimensions of radians per unit time. To satisfy the requirements that the eddy have negligible change as it advects past a sensor, Willis and Deardorff (1976) suggest that
