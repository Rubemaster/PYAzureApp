0.006  ., 0.004 E  i C) 0.002 ;Transport spectra (TS) for heat flux wT at two heights in a 2100 m thick mixed layer. valid at 1500 UTC on 30 May 1978 at Cabauw. The Netherlands. The contributions of each wavelength to the turbulent flux are shown. Based on simulation by Stull and Driedonks (1987).;One limitation of transport spectra is that the flux contribution can be small even if the mixing process is vigorous. This can happen when the difference of the variable values between the heights being mixed is small or zero. To help focus on the mixing process alone, we can define a process spectrum that does not use the values of the variable being mixed;One expects this spectrum to be the same for heat, moisture, tracers, and maybe for momentum (neglecting pressure effects and waves), because it describes the mixing process rather than the effect of the mixing on the fluid state. Fig 8.14 shows a process spectrum for the same Cabauw case as Fig 8.13. As before, the smallest wavelengths are the most important at the lowest height. As height increases. the peak in the spectrum becomes broader, less peaked, and shifts to longer wavelengths. This behavior is related to mechanisms that generate turbulence. Near the surface, strong superadiabatic lapse rates and wind shears create strong dynamic instabilities across
