To quantitatively describe and forecast the state of the boundary layer, we turn to the equations of fluid mechanics that describe the dynamics and thermodynamics of the gases in our atmosphere. Motions in the boundary layer are slow enough compared to the speed of light that the GalileanlNewtonian paradigm of classical physics applies. These equations, collectively known as the equations of motion, contain time and space derivatives that require initial and boundary conditions for their solution. Although the equations of motion together with other conservation equations can be applied directly to turbulent flows, rarely do we have sufficient initial and boundary condition information to resolve all turbulent scales down to the smallest eddy. We often dont even care to forecast all eddy motions. For simplicity, we instead pick some cutoff eddy size below which we include only the statistical effects of turbulence. In some mesoscale and synoptic models the cutoff is on the order of 10 to 100 krn, while for some boundary layer models known as large eddy simulation models the cutoff is on the order of 100 m. The complete set of equations as applied to the boundary layer are so complex that no analytical solution is known. As in other branches of meteorology, we are forced to find approximate solutions. We do this by either finding exact analytical solutions to simplified subsets of the equations, or by finding approximate numerical solutions to a more complete set of equations. Both approximations are frequently combined to allow boundary layer meteorologists to study particular phenomena. In this chapter we start with the basic governing equations and statistically average over the smaller eddy sizes. Along the way we demonstrate simplifications based on boundary layer scaling arguments. Numerical methods for solving the resulting set of equations are not covered.
