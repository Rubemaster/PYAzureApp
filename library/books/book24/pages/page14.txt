This chapter is meant to provide a descriptive overview of the boundary layer. Emphasis is placed on midlatitude boundary layers over land, because that is where much of the worlds population resides and where many boundary layer measurements have been made. In this region the diurnal cycle and the passage of cyclones are the dominant forcing mechanisms. Tropical and maritime boundary layers will also be briefly reviewed. Theories and equations presented in later chapters will make more sense when put into the context of the descriptive nature of the boundary layer as surveyed here.;The troposphere extends from the ground up to an average altitude of 11 lan, but often only the lowest couple kilometers are directly modified by the underlying surface. We can define the boundary layer as that part of the troposphere that is directly influenced by the presence of the earths surface, and responds to surface forcings with a timescale of about an hour or less. These forcings include frictional drag, evaporation and transpiration, heat transfer, pollutant emission, and terrain induced flow modification. The boundary layer thickness is quite variable in time and space, ranging from hundreds of meters to a few kilometers. An example of temperature variations in the lower troposphere is shown in Fig 1.2. These timehistories were constructed from rawinsonde soundings made every several hours near Lawton, Oklahoma. They show a diurnal variation of temperature near the ground that is not evident at greater altitudes. Such diurnal variation is one of the key characteristics of the boundary layer over land. The free atmosphere shows little diurnal variation.;Fig. 1.2 Evolution of temperatures measured near the ground (97.5 kPa) and at a height of roughly 1100 m above ground (85 kPa).
