69.  (9 Fi) is the bulk Richardson number. and 69s is the temperature difference between the air and the ground (see Table 91). Figs 9.11 shows the resulting bulk transfer coefficients for momentum and heat. Because geostrophic wind has proved to be the best scale velocity in these expressions. the equations above are also known as geostrophic drag laws. Although it is a wonhwhile goal to estimate surface flux based on measurements of mean variables aloft. estimates of the universal functions and the bulk transfer coefficients have yielded much scatter. The universality of the functions are thus still in question. making this matching scheme of dubious reliability.;.020  15 . 10 5 0 .020  15 . 10  5 a ma Fig. 9.11 Drag and heat transfer coefficients based on Fig. 9.10.

(After Yamada, 1976).;Spectral analysis of atmospheric turbulence data is a powerful tool to help probe deeper into the workings of turbulent flow. Interest in this method has always been high. as indicated by an issue of Radio Science (1969) dedicated to the spectra of meteorological variables. Nevertheless. there are some fundamental questions regarding the correspondence of Fourier modes to physical eddies (Tennekes. 1976). Similarity theory
