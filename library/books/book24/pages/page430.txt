422 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOOYturbulent fluxes, etc.) calculated from this forecast will be close to those observed. In other words, we will have accurate statistical results from deterministic pattern forecasts, even though the simulated patterns themselves do not have a onetoone correspondence with the true patterns. Such statistical accuracy can be maintained for days of simulated turbulence forecasts. For the remainder of this section we will focus on such statisticallyaccurate pattern forecasts. In fact, most modelers do not have observed wind and temperature fields with a resolution that includes the effects of all the observed eddies. Instead, they (1) initialize the model with the observed mean wind and temperature and mean boundary forcings, (2) kick start turbulent motions by imposing a pseudorandom temperature andor velocity perturbations on the mean field for just the first one or two timesteps, and (3) hope that statistically realistic structures develop. Thus, there is no intention of making precise pattern forecasts, even over the first few minutes.;Fig. 10.5 Horizontal crosssection of the resolvable eddies in a LES, for the same case as the previous figure. This slice is at VZ I  0.38. (After Deardorff. 1974).
