13.1.4 Saturation Point and the Lifting Condensation Level;To use many of the variables in Table 131 for a saturated air parcel, we must be able to determine the saturation mixing ratio. Empirical fits to the saturation curve have been reviewed by Buck (1981), Bolton (1980), Lowe (1977), Wexler (1976), and Stackpole (1967). Bolton suggests that a variation of Tetens formula (1930) is sufficiently accurate to determine the saturation (with respect to liquid) watervapor pressure (in units of kPa) for typical BL temperatures r 17.2694(T  273.16)   (0.61078 kPa)exIt T  35.86 (13.1.4a);To use many of the variables in Table 131 for a saturated air parcel, we must be able to determine the saturation mixing ratio.

The saturation mixing ratio is then found from; 0.622  P  eOal (1 3. 1.4b)for pressure P in the same units as eoal Sometimes the variation of saturation mixing ratio with temperature is needed. The ClausiusClapeyron equation can be written as;3.5ln(T)  l 0.6 r )  7.108;3.5ln(T)  l 0.6 r )  7.108and;( ) 3.5 Tsp  P  p.   LCL  T (13.1.4e);( ) 3.5 Tsp  P  p.   LCL  T (13.1.4e)for P in kPa and T in K (Bolton, 1980 Wilde, et aI., 1985). The lifting condensation level is the saturation level for an unsaturated parcel lifted dry adiabatically. As was shown in Chapter II, many convective thermals have undiluted cores, allowing the actual cloud base to be very close to the LCL calculated from surfacelayer air.;13.1.5 Convection and Cloud Available Potential Energies;Not all clouds are positively buoyant. The buoyancy of a rising air parcel can be written as g (BvlBv). or approximately as g(svlsv). where Bv  Bv cloud  Bv environ.
