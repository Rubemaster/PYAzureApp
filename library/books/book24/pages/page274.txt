The application of roughness length to bulk transfer is tied to the topic of measurement heights, which is discussed next.;!Vi and ij should all correspond to the same heights, z, above the surface. Unfortunately, no standard has been set on which height to use. One obvious height is instrument shelter height. A problem is that surface temperature and moisture are routinely measured at z  2 m, while surface winds are measured at z  10 m. In numerical models, an obvious height would be the height of the lowest grid point, even though it may be hundreds of meters above the surface. The height used has a dramatic affect on the value of the drag coefficient, because the wind speed and the difference between surface and elevated values of temperature or humidity increase as height increases for any given surface flux. This requires that magnitude of the bulk transfer coefficient decreases with height z to yield the proper surface flux.
