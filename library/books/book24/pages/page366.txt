358 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYsimplify our description of the surface layer by utilizing the flux at just one height  usually the surface. MoninObukhov similarity works only when the winds are not calm, and u. not zero. Relevant scales based on these surface fluxes and their typical orders of magnitude are listed here L Order (1 m to 200 m) zo Order (1 mm to 1 m) u. Order (0.05 to 0.3 ms);9. SL Order (0.1 to 2.0 C);9. SL Order (0.1 to 2.0 C)q. SL Order (0.1 to 5 gwate!kgair) Scales for pollutant concentration can be patterned after the humidity scale. Lists of MoninObukhov similarity relationships are tabulated in Sections 9.4 to 9.6, and a more detailed analysis ofthe logwind profile in the surface layer is given in Section 9.7.;MixedLayer Similarity. This class is applied to mixed layers that are in a state of free convection (Deardorff, 1972 Deardorff, et al., 1980 Sorbjan, 1986), assuming calm or light winds. Free convection conditions can occur during cold air advection over a wanner surface, or with solar heating of the land during the daytime in light wind conditions. The relevant scales and typical orders of magnitude for the mixed layer are;Zj Order ( 0.2 to 2 km) w. Order (2 ms);9. ML Order (0.1 K)q. ML Order (0.1 glm3);q. ML Order (0.1 glm3)u. ML Order (0.02 ms) Other scales, such as for pollutant concentration, can be defined in analogy to the moisture scale. More details are discussed in Section 9.6.;Local Similarity. For statically stable boundary layers, this class recognizes that turbulence in the mid and upper SBL may not be in equilibrium with the surface fluxes (Wyngaard, 1973 Nieuwstadt, 1984 Sorbjan, 1987). Hence, local fluxes, shears and stability are more important than surface fluxes. The relevant scales are LL Order (0 to 50 m) uL Order (0 to 0.3 ms) 9L Order (0 to 2.0 0c); Order (0 to 5 gwarekgair) Dimensionless groups formed with the above scales are not a function of height above ground hence, this scaling is also called zless scaling. Although the dimensionless groups are independent of height, the individual variables that make up these groups (including the scaling variables above) vary significantly with height.
