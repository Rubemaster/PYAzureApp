To simplify usage of the equations, we have collected them in this section and organized them in a way that similarities and differences can be more easily noted. Before we list these equations, however, we can make one additional simplification based on the scale of viscous effects vs. turbulent effects on the mean fields.;Re  V L  v  p V L  11 (3.5.1);Re  V L  v  p V L  11 (3.5.1)where land L are velocity and length scales in the boundary layer. Given vair  1.5 x 105 m2s1 and the typical scaling values V  5 mls and L  100 m in the surface layer, we find that Re  3 x 107. In the atmospheric mixed layer, the Reynolds number is even larger. The Reynolds number can be interpreted as the ratio of inertial to viscous forcings.;3.5.2 Neglect of Viscosity for Mean Motions;In each of the conservation equations except mass conservation, there are molecular diffusionviscosity terms. Observations in the atmosphere indicate that the molecular diffusion terms are several order of magnitudes smaller than the other terms and can be neglected. For example, after making the hydrostatic assumption, the momentum conservation equation for mean motions in turbulent flow (3.4.3c) can be rewritten as; aUiJU.  f  .. u...aPJ..aPJaui uj  1 VL a 2Ui at J aXj C IJ3 , J P ax p ay aXj Re ai , J (3.5.2);Each of the terms in square brackets is roughly the same order of magnitude. The last term, however, is multiplied by (lIRe)  a very small number (on the order of 107). Hence, the last term can be neglected compared to the rest, except in the lowest few centimeters above the surface.;3.5.3 Summary of Equations for Mean Variables in Turbulent Flow
