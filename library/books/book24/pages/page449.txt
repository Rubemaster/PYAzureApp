Buoyancy is the dominant mechanism driving turbulence in a convective boundary layer. Such turbulence is not completely random, but is often organized into identifiable structures such as thermals and plumes (young, 1988). Entrainment happens at a variety of scales lateral entrainment by small eddies into the sides of thermals, and vertical entrainment on the thermal scale into the whole mixed layer. In this chapter we examine the structure and evolution of the convective boundary layer, and study the forcings acting onil. Three layers can be identified within the convective boundary layer (Driedonks and Tennekes, 1984) as shown in Fig 11.1 (1) the surface layer in the bottom 5 to 10, (2) the mixed layer composing the middle 35 to 80, and (3) the entrainment zone in the top 10 to 60. In the unstable surface layer there are smallscale structures such as buoyant vertical plumes, convergence lines, sheets of rising air, and dust devils. Higherin the mixed layer we observe largerdiameter thermals, horizontal roll vortices, and mesoscale cellular convection patterns. In the entrainment zone at the top of the mixed layer we find intermittent turbulence, overshooting thermals, KelvinHelmholtz waves, internal gravity waves, and sometimes clouds. Often the whole convective boundary layer is called the mixed layer.
