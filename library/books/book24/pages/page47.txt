The real atmosphere, however, is horizontally homogeneous in only limited locations, meaning that most spatial means are averaged over a variety of different phenomena. By proper choice of sensor array domain size as well as intraarray spacing, one can sometimes isolate scales of phenomena for study, while averaging out the other scales.;Fig. 2.4 Laboratory generation of homogeneous turbulence behind a grid. Using a finer grid than Fig 2.4, the merging unstable wakes quickly form a homogeneous field. As it decays downstream, it provides a useful approximation of homogeneous turbulence.(From Van Dyke, 1982);Volume averaging is virtually impossible using direct sensors such as thermometers because of the difficulty of deploying these sensors at all locations and altitudes throughout the BL. Remote sensors such as radars, lidars, and sodars, however, can scan volumes of the atmosphere, making volume averages of selected variables possible. Details of these sensors are discussed in chapter 10. Area averaging in the surface layer is frequently performed within small domains by deploying an array of small instrumented masts or instrument shelters on the ground. Line averages are similarly performed by erecting sensors along a road, for example. Sensors mounted on a moving platform, such as a truck or an aircraft, can provide quasiline averages. These are not true line (spatial) averages because the turbulence state of the flow may change during the time it takes the platform to move along the desired path. As a result, most measurement paths are designed as a compromise between long length (to increase the statistical significance by observing a larger number of data points) and short time (because of the diurnal changes that occur in the mean and turbulent state over most land surfaces).
