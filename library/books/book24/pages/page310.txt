After Neff and Coulter (1986).;Remote sensors can yield a variety of quantitative boundary layer information. utilizing the structure function statistic. We can estimate dissipation rates because similarity arguments suggest that;C 2  2 U3 V and 2 1(3 c  a e  (8.3.1d);C 2  2 U3 V and 2 1(3 c  a e  (8.3.1d)for the inertial subrange. where a2 is a constant of about 3.0 (estimates in the literature range from 2.8 to 3.2). Wyngaard. et. al. (1971) demonstrate that surface turbulent heat flux in the ML can be calculated from cT2
