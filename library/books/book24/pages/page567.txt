CLOUDS 561and Latham, 1985 Jensen, et al., 1985). A further indication of the importance of cloud top entrainment is that the spread of cloud droplet sizes is smaller than would be observed if lateral entrainment was a more prominent process. (Raymond and Blyth. 1986 Kitchen and Caughey. 1981). Many of Telfords observations show a bimodal or multimodal droplet size distribution that further supports the cloud top entrainment mechanism (Rogers, et al.. 1985b). This prompted him to propose an entitytype entrainment mixing model (Telford and Chait 1980 Telford. et al.. 1984). where there are various different but individually wellmixed entities or blobs that move to their respective levels of neutral buoyancy. and which together form the cloud as sketched in Fig 13.8. Raymond and Blyth (1986) extended this approach to allow a variety of mixiflg proportions between cloud top and cloud base air. Betts (1986) and Betts and Miller (1986) have used mixing line results to develop a convective adjustment parameterization for use in largescale models. Betts and Albrecht (1987) further noted that evaporation of falling precipitation into parts of the cloud can cause penetrative downdrafts that result in kinks in the mixing line. In addition to thermodynamic mixingline analyses of mixing. there have been a variety of direct observations of eddy motion fields. Kitchen and Caugheys (1981) tetheredballoon observations showed a circulation pattern shaped like a 1 or a backwards P (see Fig 13.10). Eymard (1984) observed a greater vertical velocity variance immediately under clouds than at the same altitude between clouds. Brummer and Wendel (1987) confirmed that there are often downdrafts along and just outside of the lateral edges of cumulus clouds. Stith, et al. (1986) found that the updrafts at middle levels in the cloud have diameters smaller than the cloud. but that near cloud top the updraft is more diffuse and wider, implying significant mixing at cloud top.;Fig. 13.10 Flow vectors constructed from the u,v, and w wind components near a cloud (shaded). A suggested flow pattern, marked with heavy lines, has an inclined updraft overturning at cloud top in the direction of the mean wind shear. This circulation assumes the shape of a ?.
