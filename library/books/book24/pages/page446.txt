1) Suppose that an upward looking lidar sees a layer of aerosol swelling at zI .5 km, just above the top of a 1 km deep mixed layer. a) Would a (microwave) radar be able to detect this 1.5 km layer? Why? b) Would a sodar be able to detect this layer? Why?;2) Given wT  0.2 Kms! and wq  0.001 (gwaterl gair)ms!, find QH;3) Which remote sensor (lidar, sodar, radar) best measures the following? a) Dispersion of smoke b) Depth of the marine boundary layer near San Francisco, California c) Clearair turbulence (CA 1) at the jetstream level d) Top of a 2km thick mixed layer. e) Temperature fluctuations in the entrainment zone f) Moisture fluctuations near cloud base 4) a) What instruments are required to measure the Bowen ratio in the surface layer using eddycorrelation methods? b) What sampling frequency is necessary to make the above measurement (i.e., how fast should the data be digitized)? c) Over what averaging time should measurements be taken? 5) Describe the differences and similarities between largeeddy simulation and laboratory watertank simulation of the boundary layer. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?;6) Let Km  5 m2s!  constant with height. Calculate and plot (a) u w  and (b) w 0 v from z  0 to 50 m using data from problem 26 of Chapt 5. 7) Which remote sensors could be used to measure the thickness of the mixed layer, for cases where the mixed layer is over 1 km thick?;9) If upsidedown U structures are observed with a vertically pointing radar, then what type of boundary layer can be inferred? 10) Using the similarity theory results from Section 5.2.7, find the dissipation rate, c, at (a) z 50 m and (b) z 600 m;9) If upsidedown U structures are observed with a vertically pointing radar, then what type of boundary layer can be inferred? 10) Using the similarity theory results from Section 5.2.7, find the dissipation rate, c, at (a) z 50 m and (b) z 600 mfor a day and time where w 9 v   0.3 Kms I, gl9 v  0.0333 ms2K!, and zi500 m.
