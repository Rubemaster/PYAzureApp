Fig. 3.10 (a) Temperature profiles measured by high resolution rawlnsonde soundings launched near Canton. Oklahoma on 18 June 1983 during the BLX 83 field experiment. The circles show data from the 2100 COT lauch. Squares show those of the 2230 COT launch. (bl Contributions of turbulence (shaded lines). radiation (dotted line). and subsidence (solid lines) to the cooling rate are modeled for that 1.5 hour period. The two shaded and two solid lines show the range of the lespective contributions during the period (Carlson and Stull. 1986).;Fig. 3.11 . Temperature budgets at t.18 h and t.02 h during Night 3334 of Wangara R. radiative transfer T  turbulent transport (Andr6. et al.. 1978).
