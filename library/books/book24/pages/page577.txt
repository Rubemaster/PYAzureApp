Fig. 13.20 Idealized cloudprocess components are sketched in (a) through (e) for coupled (solid) and uncoupled (dashed) cloud and subcloud layers. These can be combined to make profiles for more realistic scenarios (cloudfree ML (9) entraining nocturnal BL over a warm surface (h) daytime BL, no entrainment, no surface heating and (i) decoupled daytime BL.
