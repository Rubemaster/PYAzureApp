Furthermore, if we remember from section 3.3.1;then the term in square brackets is zero. Furthermore, if we remember from section 3.3.1that pp is on the order of 3.33 x 10,3 , then we see that the factor on the left hand side;that pp is on the order of 3.33 x 10,3 , then we see that the factor on the left hand sideof the equation is approximated by ( 1  pp)  1. We cant neglect, however, the first;of the equation is approximated by ( 1  pp)  1. We cant neglect, however, the firstterm on the right hand side of the equal sign, because the product pp g is as large as the other terms in the equation. The process of neglecting density variations in the inenia (storage) term, but retaining it in the buoyancy (gravity) term is called the Boussinesq approximation. These two approximations leave;term on the right hand side of the equal sign, because the product pp g is as large as the other terms in the equation.

By comparing the original equations to the scaled equations above, one finds differences in the terms involving p and g. Thus, a simple way to apply the Boussinesq approximation without performing the complete derivation is stated here
