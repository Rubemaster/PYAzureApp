X k,,J kg,.,,,m .. m pollutant 2 or 3 s ms m;Sometimes the moisture flux is rewritten as a latent heat flux, E where   Lv and Lv is the latent heat of vaporization of water ( Lv  2.45 X 106 Jkg at a summertime BL temperature of 20C). As a reminder, momentum is mass times velocity (kgmls) thus, a momentum flux is;(kgmls)(m2.s). These units are identical to Nm2, which are the units for stress. The nature of stress is reviewed in section 2.9. Unfortunately, we rarely measure quantities such as heat or momentum directly. Instead we measure things like temperature or wind speed. Therefore, for convenience the above fluxes can be redefined in kinematic form by dividing by the density of moist air, Pail In the case of sensible heat flux, we also divide by the specific heat of air.;In fact, the term pCp  1.216 x 103 cYVm2) I (Kmls) allows us to easily convert between kinematic heat fluxes and normal heat fluxes.;Kinematic Flux  Equation mass M  M Pair   (2.6.1 a);mass M  M Pair   (2.6.1 a)heat QH  K  (2.6.lb) P .
