Discussion Fig 7.20a b show plots of the fluxes and temperature. We see that the ground flux changes sign well before sunset. The negative ground flux that follows implies an upward transpon of heat from the ground to the surface. When this is added to the incoming radiation Q we see that the sensible heat flux OH becomes larger than Q, in the late afternoon.;.  .. C?9. . .................. ....... ,. u..

This is related to the fact that the ground has some thenna! inertia, leaving the ground temperature warmer than the air temperature during a few hours near sunset when the ground flux has already become negative. During this shon period, the ground is loosing heat not only to the cooler air, but also by radiation to space. This causes the temporary bulge in ground flux at night. Later at night, the ground fInally becomes colder than the air. allowing some of the heat lost to space to be replaced by conduction from the air.;Anthes. R.A . E.Y. Hsie, and Y.H.
