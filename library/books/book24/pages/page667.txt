Frontispiece Caption . Add sentence Both figures show a solidbody surface separating aerosol laden (polluted) air below from cleaner air aloft. Caption for Fig a. Add sentence Rising thermals carry aerosols from the surface, causing the contour surface to extend up at each thermal. Caption for Fig b. Change the local time to 630, and the BLtop winds to 10 mls. Add Shear is evident by the folds along the right edge of the contour surface.;Chapter 1 6 Between eqs (1.4a) and (I.4b) in the body, add the partial derivative symbol i just before the  in the last term of the equation. 18 Fig 1.14 . Switch FI and F2 in the figure, but not in the caption.;Chapter 2 32 Fig 2.2. Move middle peak left to 24 h. 27 In last figure on page. Replace the third short horizontal line with two short horizontal lines, with the new line added just above the existing third line. 35 Eq (2.4.1 b right). Change the lower limit of integration from t  0 to S  O. 36 Fig 2.4 caption. Replace sentence Using a finer grid than Fig 2.4. with Flow is from left to right.;43 First line in body after Fig 2.6.
