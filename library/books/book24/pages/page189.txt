Table 51. Example of a nighttime rawinsonde sounding analyzed to give stability, shear, Richardson number, and the probability and intensity of turbulence. Probabilities are expressed as a percent, and intensities are abbreviated by N  no turbulence, L  light (0.5 G), M  moderat3 (1 G), SS9vere (2 G) These Intensity levels correspond to the turbulence reporting recommendations used in aviation, where the vertical acceleration measured in Gs (number of times the pull of gravity) is relative to the center of gravity of the aircraft. For practical purposes, a probability greater than 50 AND an intensity greater than L were required before a CAT forecast would be issued.;Table 51.

Since the flux Richardson number is defined as the ratio of the buoyancy term to the negative of the shear term, we can use the values for these terms already calculated in example 5.2.8;Discussion. A negative Richardson number is without question less than  1, and thus indicates dynamic instability and turbulence. This is a trivial conclusion, because any flow that is statically unstable is also dynamically unstable by definition.
