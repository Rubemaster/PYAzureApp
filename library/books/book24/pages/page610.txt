11  1.6 zhilJIWI2 (Taylor  Teunissen, 1987 Taylor  Lee, 1984 Hunt, 1980). The half width of the hill, W 12 is defined as the horizontal upstream distance from the crest to the point where the elevation has decreased to half its maximum. For typical gentle hills ( zhiU  100 m, W 12  250 m) the speedup of the wind just above the crest of the hill can be 60 or more, which is important for siting windturbine gederators. Fig 14.17 shows the wind speed proflles at various locations on the hill (Teunissen, et al., 1987). Well upwind at point A, out of the region of influence, the wind is logarithmic with height as expected for neutral stratificaticn. Closer to the hill, at point B, some blocking is experienced and the lowaltitude winds are slower. By point C, the winds above 2 m have accelerated beyond the undisturbed upstream values, and even become faster than ambient winds aloft at point D at the crest of the hill. To the lee of the hill, the lowaltitude winds rapidly decrease, and can become slower than the undisturbed upstream values, or can reverse direction as discussed earlier.;Fig. 14.17 Wind tunnel simulation of the wind profiles over a hill, at the stations labeled A through F on Fig. 14.16. (After Teunissen, et aI., 1987.);Below this height is an inner layer where friction with the ground reduces the wind speed. Above this height in an outer layer, the flow can be well described by inviscid potential flow theory.
