After Businger (1982).;According to this solution, the surface wind vector is 45 0 to the left of the geostrophic wind vector in the Northern Hemisphere. Hence, the surface stress is also in this direction, because it is caused by the drag of the surface wind against the surface. Use u.2 as a measure of the surface stress magnitude, where u.2  (u w )2  (v w)2  12 ;(KmdDdZ)2  (KmdVdZ)2jl2 evaluated at zO. Inserting (6.4.6c) into this expression yields;The wind speed is supergeostrophic at height z  1tffE, which is also the lowest height where the wind is parallel to geostrophic. Sometimes this height is used as an estimate of the depth of the neutral boundary layer. Hence, the Ekman layer depth, hE;The wind speed is supergeostrophic at height z  1tffE, which is also the lowest height where the wind is parallel to geostrophic. Sometimes this height is used as an estimate of the depth of the neutral boundary layer. Hence, the Ekman layer depth, hEis defined as hE  1tffE. If Km is assumed to equal ckuhE, where c is a constant of;is defined as hE  1tffE. If Km is assumed to equal ckuhE, where c is a constant ofproportionality equal to about 0.1, and k is the von Karman constant, then the Ekman layer depth for a neutral boundary layer becomes
