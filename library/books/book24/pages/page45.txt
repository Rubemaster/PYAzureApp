Fig 2.3 shows an expanded view of just a small portion of the wind trace from Fig 2.1 . The straight line represents the mean wind over that portion of the record, while the wiggly line represents the actual instantaneous wind speed. The gust part, u, is sketched as the distance between those two lines. At some times the gust is positive, meaning the actual wind is faster than average. At other times the gust is negative, indicative of a slower than average wind. Microscale turbulence is a threedimensional phenomenon. Therefore, we expect that gusts in the xdirection might be accompanied by gusts in the y and zdirections. Turbulence, by definition, is a type of motion. Yet motions frequently cause variations in the temperature, moisture, and pollutant fields if there is some mean gradient of that variable across the turbulent domain. Hence, we can partition each of the variables into mean and turbulent parts;Fig 2.3 shows an expanded view of just a small portion of the wind trace from Fig 2.1 .
