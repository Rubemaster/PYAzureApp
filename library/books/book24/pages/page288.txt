The specific heat at constant pressure is assumed to be constant ,  1005 J(kg K), and the gas constant forair is also assumed to be constant 9t  287.04 J(kg K). Both the PriestleyTaylor and the PenmanMonteith methods are a function of Sec,;air is also assumed to be constant 9t  287.04 J(kg K). Both the PriestleyTaylor and the PenmanMonteith methods are a function of Sec,which in turn is a function of temperature. Table 75 lists the values of Lv(T) , Y(T), Gsat(T) , scc(T), and (Qs  Qo), and saturation vapor pressure esat(T) In the second page of Table 75, we finally compute QE and QH for both the Priestly Taylor and the PenmanMonteith methods. Also computed in the table are the Bowen ratios for both methods, and the value of Fw (gwategair)m!s  for the PenmanMonteith method.;Discussion Fig 7.15ac shows the variations of the terms in the surface energy balance for both methods. Fig 7 .15a indicates that all of the fluxes are in phase with the radiative forcing for the PriestelyTaylor method. In particular, all of the fluxes cross the zero line at the same times. The latent heat flux is larger than the sensible heat flux for this case. At night, all of the fluxes are negative, including the latent heat flux. This is related to dew or frost.;24  O.
