Fig. 12.23 Downslope drainage winds in a SBl.mixing, and entrainment. Fig 12.23 also shows the typical coordinate system used for modeling studies of slope flows. As the air flows down the slope, the depth of the drainage flow can grow, and the peak speed can increase. Fig 12.24 shows the slope flow evolution down a 10 average slope covered by grass and short brush (Doran and Horst, 1983 Horst and Doran, 1986). For this case, a very shallow flow with nose at about 50 m over the initial 21  slope evolves into a deeper flow with nose at about 300 m further down the hill where the slope is only 8.;Fig. 12.24 Evolution of a drainage flow down a 100 slope. (After Horst and Doran, 1986).;In the absence of ambient mean flow, drainage wind speeds range between 0.5 to 3.5 mls. When ambient mean winds are light, the drainage flows in the same direction as the mean wind are enhanced, while those opposing the mean wind are reduced (Yamada,
