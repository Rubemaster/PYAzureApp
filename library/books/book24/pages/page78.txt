TOOLS PART 1. STATISTICS 67atmospheric sealevel value for kinematic viscosity of air is 1.4607 x 105 m2s. For a mean wind shear of 0.5 S1 (typical for atmospheric surface layers), the resulting viscous stress is 7.304 x 106 m2s2. This value is so much smaller than the Reynolds stresses in the BL that the viscous stress is usually neglected in mean wind forecasts. Turbulent eddies, however, can have much larger values of shear in localized eddysize regions. We thus can not neglect viscosity when forecasting turbulence.;For the special case where the coordinate system is aligned so that the xaxis points in thedirection of the surface stress, we can rewrite (2.1Ob) as u  luwsl  ICReynoldslp. Examples of u. evolution are shown in Figs 2.17 and 4.l.
