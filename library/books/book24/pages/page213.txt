This closure approximation is often J called gradient transport theory or Ktheory. Although it is one of the simplest parameterizations, it frequently fails when largersize eddies are present in the flow. Hence, we can catalog (6.4.1b) as a smalleddy closure technique. K is known by a variety of names  eddy viscosity  eddy diffusivity  eddytransfer coefficient  turbulenttransfer coefficient  gradienttransfer coefficient because it relates the turbulent flux to the gradient of the associated mean variable. Sometimes, different K values are associated with different variables. A subscript m is used for momentum, resulting in Km as the eddy viscosity. For heat and moisture, we will use KH and KE for the respective eddy diffusivities. There is some experimental evidence to suggest that for statically neutral conditions;It is not clear why K.n should be smaller than the other K values. Perhaps pressure correlation effects contaminated the measurements upon which (6.4.lc) was based.;Problem A Given KH  5 m2s 1 for turbulence within a background stable environment, where the local lapse rate is aeaz  0.01 Kim. Find w e, the kinematic heat flux.;Solution Use u j   K aaXj. Let  represent e, and set j 3. This gives;Solution Use u j   K aaXj. Let  represent e, and set j 3. This giveswe  KH    (5 m2sl ) (0.01 Kim)   0.05 K mls;Discussion A negative heat flux would normally be expected in a statically stable environment, assuming only small eddies were present. In other words, in an environment with warm air above colder air, turbulence moves warm air down the gradient to cooler air, which in this case is a downward (or negative) flux.
