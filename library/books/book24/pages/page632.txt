A Note OD NotatioD. Some notational compromises were required to avoid the conflicting defmitions of symbols that appeared in the boundarylayer literature. For example. h is used for both moist static energy and boundarylayer depth. f for frequency and Coriolis parameter, and U for wind speed and wind component in the x direction. For some cases we resolved the conflicts by adding subscripts (e.g., fc for Coriolis parameter). In other situations we extended existing classes of notation (e.g . s for both dry and moist static energies). Finally. in a few cases we had to defme new symbols (e.g . M for wind magnitude).
