50 BOUNDARYLAYEROROLOGYthrough a plane normal to any of the three cartesian directions. The momentum flux is thus said to be a tensor. Just for the record, this kind of tensor is known as a second order tensor. A vector is a first order tensor, and a scalar is a zero order tensor.;Fig. 2.11 Momentum can be split into the three cartesian directions, based on the u, v, and w components of wind. Momentum flux can consist of the transfer of any of these three components in any of three directions x, y, and z, yielding a total of nine momentum flux components.;Fig. 2.11 Momentum can be split into the three cartesian directions, based on the u, v, and w components of wind. Momentum flux can consist of the transfer of any of these three components in any of three directions x, y, and z, yielding a total of nine momentum flux components.z;As you might guess. we can split the fluxes into mean and turbulent parts. For the flux associated with the mean wind (Le . advection). it is easy to show. for example. that;Auxes in other directions can be constructed in an analogous fashion. These fluxes have the proper dimensions for kinematic fluxes. They also make physical sense. For example. a greater vertical velocity or a greater potential temperature both create a greater vertical heat flux. as would be intuitively expected.;Problem. Given QH  365 Wm2. Find QH .;Solution. QH  QH  (p c,)  (365 Wm2)  (1.21 kgm,3)(lOO5 J.kg,IK1)  0.30 Kms;Discussion. This is a typical daytime kinematic heat flux during strong convection.
