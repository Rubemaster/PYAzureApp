SIMILARITY lHEORY 361z 0.74  4.7 L (9.4.1d);These last two expressions are known as BusingerDyer fluxprofile relationships, because they relate mean profile gradients to the fluxes in u. and 9. SL. These relationships are plotted in Fig 9.9, and are discussed in more detail in Section 9.7.;The above expressions are zJess. In order to make these more useful, some parameterizations have been proposed for the fluxes upon which uL and lL are baseduw 1 UdO.7  2 U. (9.4.2c);uw 1 UdO.7  2 U. (9.4.2c)uw  1  If or 2;2 U.
