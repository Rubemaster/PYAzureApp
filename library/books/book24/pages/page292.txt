Both of these simple schemes assume that the sign of the ground flux is always the same as that of the net radiation or sensible heat flux. The latter scheme would fail in an oasis situation.;Fig. 7.16 Range of soil heat flux density Q .. plotted against net radiation for 1040 hourly values during da)llme. Darker shadings indicate a higher density of data points. lines indicate various approximations. (After DeBruin, personal communication).;At the opposite end of sophistication is a multilevel or analytical model of the soil, where prognostic equations are solved for the temperature at a large number of depths in the soil. Fig 7.17 shows a typical temperature variation over a diurnal cycle in the soil and the atmosphere. Note the scale change for the heightdepth axis. Most of the temperature variation in the soil happens within the top 20 centimeters. Below about one meter there is little temperature change associated with the daily cycle, although the annual cycle signal is much larger at that depth. Since molecular conduction is the primary transport process, we can write the ground flux at any depth as or Qg  k  g dZ (7.6.2a);At the opposite end of sophistication is a multilevel or analytical model of the soil, where prognostic equations are solved for the temperature at a large number of depths in the soil.
