Physically, term V relates the correlation (covariance) between moisture and temperature to the production of moisture flux. One would expect that warmer air rises (3.3.3b) thus, if warmer air is also moister (i.e., a positive correlation), then the moist air would probably rise, thereby contributing to the moisture flux. Physically, term XI suggests production of moisture flux when there is a momentum flux in a mean moisture gradient. The turbulent momentum flux implies a turbulent movement of air. If that movement occurs across a mean moisture gradient, then moisture fluctuation would be expected, as is suggested by analogy to Fig 2.13. For the special case of vertical moisture flux (i3) in a horizontally homogeneous setting with no subsidence, (4.4.2b) reduces to dq ,2  w  dz;Case Study Examples. The slope of the moisture flux curve in Fig 4.17 indicates that dry air is being entrained at the top of the ML fast enough to reduce the mean ML;1600humidity flux N during Day 33, 800 Wangara.
