z,, wa  and maybe gl9 to always be important in convection, because heating, y s y convection, and buoyancy cause thermals to rise to the top of the mixed layer. In fact,these key variables are often grouped as (gla y )wa y  .. zil during a dimensional;these key variables are often grouped as (gla y )wa y  .. zil during a dimensionalanalysis. We recognize this group to be the basis for the definition of the convective;analysis. We recognize this group to be the basis for the definition of the convectivevelocity scale w. namely, w.3 (glay )wa y  .. Zj as defined in Section 4.2.;Zj instead. With this last set of variables, we can easily identify the dimensionless groupsby inspection w ,2wl and zz.;The most common classes of similarity scaling are MoninObukhov similarity, mixedlayer similarity, local similarity, local free convection, and Rossbynumber similarity. When dealing with one of these welldefined classes of problems, it is appropriate to use the associated scaling variables as the key variables in a dimensional analysis.;MoninObukhov Similarity. This class is usually applied to the surface layer (Monin and ObukhoY, 1954 Wyngaard, 1973 Sorbjan, 1986), and hence is sometimes called surfacelayer similarity. Earlier we defined the surface layer as that part of the boundary layer where the fluxes vary by less than 10 of their magnitude with height. To a first order approximation, this layer is a constant flux layer. We can thus
