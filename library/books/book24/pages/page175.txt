Fig. 5.15 Example of variation of dissipation rate with (tJ time from night to day. 1. After Louis, et al. (1983). w;The close relationship between TKE production rate, intensity of turbulence, and dissipation rate is shown in Fig 5.15. At night where only shear can produce turbulence, the dissipation rate is small because the associated TKE is small (refer back to Fig 5.2). After sunrise, buoyant production greatly increases the turbulence intensity, resulting in the associated increase in dissipation seen in Fig 5.15.;conditions were observed iiuaz  0.01 Sl, 9 v  25C, w9 v  015 K mis, andu w   0.03 m2s2.

If the pressure andturbulent transports are neglected, then (a) what dissipation rate is required to maintain a locally steady state at z  300 m and (b) what are the values of the normalized TKE terms?;Solution (a) Since no information was given about the V component of velocity or stress, lets assume that the xaxis has been chosen to be aligned with the mean wind. Looking at the TKE budget (5.1b), we know that term I must be zero for steady state, and terms V and VI are zero as specified in the statement of the problem. Thus, the remaining terms can be manipulated to solve for
