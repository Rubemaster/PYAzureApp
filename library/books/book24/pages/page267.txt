(7.3.1d)where 4r is the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer (23.45  0.409 radians), d is the number of the day of the year (e.g., October 27  day 300), d,. is the day of the summer solstice (173), and dy is the average number of days per year (365.25). Define the albedo, a, as the fraction of downwelling radiation at the surface that is reflected. The albedo varies from about 0.95 over fresh snow, 0.4 over lightcolored dry soils, 0.2 over grass and many agriculture crops, 0.1 over coniferous forests, to 0.05 over dark wet soils. The upwelling (reflected) radiation is thus;The albedo of water not only varies with wave state, but is a strong function of sun angle (Krauss, 1972). When the sun is directly overhead over a smooth water surface, the albedo is about 0.05, while it increases to nearly 1.0 at low elevation angles.;As is obvious in Fig 7.5, the upward and downward longwave radiation terms are both large, but of opposite sign. Also, they do not vary much with time in clear sky conditions. As a result, the net longwave radiation (1  Ii  I.L ) is approximately constant with time, and is often negative because of the net radiative loss from the earthatmosphere system to space. When clouds are present, much of the outgoing radiation can be balanced by downward radiation from the clouds. Low clouds are more effective at this than high clouds. For overcast clouds at all three levels, we might expect the net radiation to be approximately zero. The net upward long wave radiation at the surface is sometimes approximated (Burridge and Gadd, 1974) by;This type of parameterization is known to be an oversimplification of the actual physics. Nevertheless, it is useful when detailed radiation parameterizations are not appropriate. An alternative to parameterizing the net longwave radiation is to parameterize the Ii and I.L terms separately. The StefanBoltzmann law gives
