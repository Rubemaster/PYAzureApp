( 21tkn ) A(k,n)  C.Cn)sin rr (S.S.lb);( 21tkn ) A(k,n)  C.Cn)sin rr (S.S.lb)where C.  Ccos and Cc  C sin. As shown in section S.4.1 the Fourier transforms give the amplitudes of sine and cosine terms in the spectral decomposition of the original field. Thus, we can also interpret the spectra in tenns of an amplitude and phase shift for waves of each frequency.;We can rewrite this definition as G A  FAF A where FA is the complex conjugate of FA and where the dependence on n is still implied. To demonstrate this last definition, let FA  FAr  iF Ai where subscripts rand idenote real and imaginary parts respectively. Thus, the complex conjugate is simply FA
