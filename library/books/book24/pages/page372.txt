Problem Find the local value of the heat flux at a height of z  50 m in a SBL, where the local lapse rate is 0.025 KIm and the local scaling velocity is uL  0.1 mls.;Solution Equation (9.4.1b) can be manipulated, using the definition for LL to read; 2 wewhere the value of the universal constant was taken as 4.7. Assuming that (gle)  0.0333;where the value of the universal constant was taken as 4.7. Assuming that (gle)  0.0333ms2K 1, we find that we  3.4 x 10.3 K mls.;Although boundary layers are rarely exactly neutral, there are situations such as strong winds and overcast skies where the boundary layer is approximately neutral. In a neutral boundary layer the only (or dominant) TKE generation mechanism is mechanical, associated with wind shear and surface stress. Thus. we expect u. to be important. Rarely is the Obukhov length used, because it is infinite in statically neutral conditions. Some investigators (Sorbjan, 1986) have suggested similarity parameterizations based on pseudolocal scaling (using scales uL eL, but including z instead of LL),while others (Nicholls and Readings, 1979 Grant, 1986) have applied surfacelayer similarity;Although boundary layers are rarely exactly neutral, there are situations such as strong winds and overcast skies where the boundary layer is approximately neutral.

Occasionally. it is assumed that a well defined top of the turbulent boundary layer can be identified, allowing Zj to be used. Surface layer parameterizations are often based on the limiting cases of diabatic similarity relationships, for the case where z!L goes to zero (Wyngaard and Cote, 1971 Merry and Panofsky, 1976 Panofsky et ai, 1977 Nicholls and Readings, 1979 Smith, 1980 Grant, 1986 and Sorbjan, 1986).
