Halforder closure uses a subset of the first moment equations (3.5.3). A variation of this approach is called the bulk method, where a profile shape for wind or temperature is assumed, but where the resulting wind or temperature curve can be shifted depending on the bulkaverage background wind or temperature within the whole layer.;(3.5.3), a profile shape 9(z) is assumed, and then the final values of 9(z,t) are found;(3.5.3), a profile shape 9(z) is assumed, and then the final values of 9(z,t) are foundfrom 9(z,t)  9(t  9(z). Such schemes are used for bulk or slab mixedlayer;Firstorder closure retains the prognostic equations for only the zeroorder mean variables such as wind, temperature, and humidity. As an example, consider the idealized scenario of a dry environment, horizontally homogeneous, with no subsidence. The geostrophic wind is assumed to be known as a prescribed boundary condition. The goveming prognostic equations (3.5.3) for the zeroorder variables then reduce to;Firstorder closure retains the prognostic equations for only the zeroorder mean variables such as wind, temperature, and humidity.
