The period of oscillation, called the inertial period, is 21tfc At rnidlatitudes, the inertial period is about 17 h. The magnitude of the oscillation at night depends on the amount of geoslrophic departure at the end of the day. Typical geoslrophic departures are on the order of 2 to 5 rns at the end of the day, leading to nocturnal jet maxima that can be 2 to 5 rns faster than geoslrophic (Garratt, 1985 and Kraus, et al., 1985).;Problem. Frictional drag during the day results in geoslrophic departures of Fu  Fy  3 rns at sunset. Calculate and plot the resulting nocturnal winds for every hour over a full inertial period. Also detennine the time of occurrence and maximum speed of the nocturnal jet. Assume fc  104 sI, Ug  10 rns, and V g  O.;Solution. Solving (12.S.3d) using the conditions above gives the winds listed in the Table 121. These are plotted as a hodograph in Fig 12.18. We see that the wind vectors describe a circle about the geoslrophic wind, with a radius of 4.24 rns. A maximum wind speed of 14.24 mls is reached about 6.S h after sunset. In fact, the wind speeds are supergeoslrophic for about a 9 h period.;Discussion. Initially, the winds are subgeoslrophic and cross the isobars toward low pressure, as expected with friction. Shortly after sunset, the winds continue to tum toward low pressure (Mahrt, 1981). However, between 7 and IS h after sunset the winds cross the isobars toward high pressure during a portion of the inertial oscillation. Such ageoslrophic winds can lead to convergence regions that can trigger thunderstorms.
