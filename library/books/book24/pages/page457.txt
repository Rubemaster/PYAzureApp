MIXED LAYER 449almost as often over nondusty ground, although the absence of dust makes them invisible to the eye. Dust devils form in the same general conditions as plumes and coexist with them, but are only about 10 as numerous. Fig 11.9 shows the circulations structure of an idealized dust devil (Sinclair, et al., 1977). A weak downdraft with vertical velocities on the order of 2 mls in the center of the dust devil is usually less dusty than the surrounding vortex, and is often visible to the eye. The dust devil is approximately cylindrical, and is tilted with the ambient shear. Like the plume, it translates at a speed equal to the wind speed averaged over its depth, and thus moves faster than the surface wind. Although it occurs less frequently than the plume, it transports about ten times the vertical heat flux (Kaimal and Businger, 1970).;Fig. 11.9 Idealized dust devil. (After Sinclair,et aI., 1977).;It has been suggested that a certain critical tangential velocity is needed to allow the dust devil to persist against the disruptive action of turbulence. These critical vorticities can sometimes be achieved by eddies generated by the mean wind flowing around obstacles. It is also possible that chance occurrences of vorticity in the mean flow are enhanced by vortex line stretching in plume updrafts. No favored direction of rotation in dust devils has been noted.
