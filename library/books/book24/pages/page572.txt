566 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYwhere Lx and Sx are the location and shape parameters, and X represents diameter or depth. Integrating (13.3.4) over all X yields 1.0, which means that 100 of the clouds present are explained.;Fig . 13.14 Histograms of (a) cloud depth. and (b) cloud width. as measured from an airborne forwardlooking automatic camera system. A total of 78 fairweather cumulus were observed during this one BLX83 case. The smooth curve is a maximumlikelihood best fit of a 10 normal distribution function to the data.

Bougeault (1982) produced idealized profiles of liquid water potential temperature and total water mixing ratio (Fig 13.15) using data from the Puerto Rico, Voves, and GATE field experiments. The Puerto Rican data was obtained over the westem tropical Atlantic (Pennell and LeMone, 1974), where there was a strong capping tradewind inversion at 1.5 km, strong (15 mls) BL winds, and vigorous turbulence generation (primarily by shear in the lower third of the BL). The suppressed cumulus clouds in this region are called tradewind cumuli.;9L Fig. 13.15 Profiles of 9L(solid) and rT (shaded) for four selected cases. Top scale is. r Tin 9  kg  bottom.9L in K .
