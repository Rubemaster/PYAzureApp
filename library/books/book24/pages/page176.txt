Dividing our terms by this value, and rewriting in the same order as (S.2.3) yields;Term o J 0.625  0.038  0  0  0.663 III IV V VI VII;Discussion This buoyant production term is about an order of magnitude larger than the mechanical production term, meaning that the turbulence is in a state of free convection. In regions of strong turbulence production, the transport term usually removes some of the TKE and deposits it where there is a net loss of TKE, such as in the entrainment zone. Thus, we might expect that the local dissipation rate at z  300 m is smaller than the value calculated above.;As will be shown in chapter 8, the TKE budget equation can be written in a spectral form where the the contributions of each term in (S.I) can be examined as a function of wavelength or eddy size. Fig S.16b shows the following terms as a function of wavenumber buoyant production (Term III), shear production (Term IV), and dissipation (Term VII), all measured at one height in the BL. The turbulent transport and pressure redistribution term calculations were inaccurate, and hence left out of these figures. One additional term appears in the spectral form of the TKE equation the transfer of energy across the spectrum. In this case, as in most atmospheric cases, the transfer is from large size eddies (low wavenumbers) to small sizes (high wavenumbers). The concept behind this cascade of energy was introduced in Chapter 2. The rate of flow of this energy, shown in Fig 5.16a, is greatest for middle size eddies. Not only is it largest there, but it is also relatively constant with wavenumber. Hence, there is no net divergence or convergence of energy in the middle of the spectral domain, but there is a large amount of energy flowing through that domain. The slope of the curve in Fig S.16a determines the magnitude of the transport term in FigS.16b. Large size eddies are presented on the left side of these figures, and small on the right. We see in Fig 5.16b that there is liule energy at the very largest sizes, corresponding to the spectral gap. Once we get down to a normalized wavenumber of 0.01, we see large magnitudes of the shear and buoyant production terms. The production is not dissipated
