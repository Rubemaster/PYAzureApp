578 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYlongwave cooling at cloud top can cause the boundary layer to warm and the fog base to lilt from the ground. This fog is then reclassified as a stratocumulus cloud (Fig 13.25c). Sometimes the patchiness of the fog is enhanced by solar heating of the ground between patches, causing the fog to break up into cumulus clouds. A windspeed increase can also enhance mixing of the fog with drier, warmer air aloft to trigger fog lifting or breakup. The onset time of fog, and the transition from a mist to a wellmixed fog, are sensitive to the balance between all processes (Turton and Brown, 1987). Small errors in anyone of the processes can lead to large errors in fog forecasts and models. As a result, precise onset and dissipation times for fog are often difficult to forecast.;Advection of warm humid air over a cooler surface can result in advection fog. Such fogs are frequently found off the west coast of California, and the west coasts of South America. With persistent wind fields and sea surface temperature, it is relatively easy to forecast the onset location and mean properties of this fog. Advection fogs are also found during spring when warm, moist air advects over snow and cold lake surfaces. Forecast methods utilize SBL and TIBL evolution physics. Once formed, radiative cooling of the fog top can enhance the mixing, creating the stratocumuluslike advection fog with a sharp top. Light winds can also induce sufficient mixing to create a cool ML filled with advection fog.;Albrecht, B.A., R.S. Penc and W.H. Schubert, 1985 An observational study of cloud topped mixed layers. J.
