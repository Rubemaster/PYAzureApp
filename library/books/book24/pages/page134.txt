(  v ( au.)2 ax (4.3.ld);It is obvious that this tenn is always positive, because it is a squared quantity. Therefore, when used in (4.3.1a) with the negative sign as required by (4.3.lc), it is always causing a decrease in the variance with time. That is, it is always a loss term. In addition, it becomes larger in magnitude as the eddy size becomes smaller. For these small eddies, the eddy motions are rapidly damped by viscosity and irreversibly converted into heat. This heating rate is so small, however, that it has been neglected in the heat conservation equation (3.4.Sb).;Pressure Perturbations. Using the product rule of calculus again, the pressuretenn 2 (u.p) apax. in (4.3.1a) can be rewritten as I I;The last tenn is called the pressure redistribution term. The factor in square brackets consists of the sum of three tenns auax, avay, and awaz. These tenns sum to zero because of the turbulence continuity equation (3.4.2c) hence, the last tenn in the equation above does not change the total variance (by total variance we mean the sum of all three variance components). But it does tend to take energy out of the components having the most energy and put it into components with less energy. Thus it makes the turbulence more isotropic, and is also known as the returntoisotropy term. Tenns like auax are larger for the smaller size eddies. Thus, we would expect that smaller size eddies are more isotropic than larger ones. As we shall see later, this is indeed the case in the boundary layer. The end result of this analysis is that;2 ( u) ap   pax  (4.3.le);Coriolis Term. The Coriolis tenn 2f (3 u.u. is identically zero for velocity C IJ I J variances, as can be seen by performing the sums implied by the repeated indices
