After sunrise a new ML begins to grow, eventually reaching the height of the elevated smoke plume from the previous night. At this time, the elevated pollutants are mixed down to the ground by ML entrainment and turbulence in a process that is called fumigation . A sketch of this process is shown in Fig 1.14. An analogous process is;After sunrise a new ML begins to grow, eventually reaching the height of the elevated smoke plume from the previous night.

Smoke plume 1 is fumigated at time F1 . while plume 2 is fumigated at time F2.
