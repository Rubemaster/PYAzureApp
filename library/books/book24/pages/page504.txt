7) Given the initial sounding at to  0600 local time as plotted below. Assume that the sensible heat flux varies with time over this land surface according tow fa f  clsin1t (tto)1  1, where CI  0.2 K m sI, and Cz  12 h. Use the;w fa f  clsin1t (tto)1  1, where CI  0.2 K m sI, and Cz  12 h. Use thethermodynamic (encroachment) approach to estimate the mixed layer depth (Zj) and;9) H the initial lapse rate at sunrise is linear (with a9fc)z  10 Kkm and a surfacetemperature of 9  10C), and if the total heat input from sunrise to 10 AM is 1()3 mK, then use the thermodynamic method to estimate Zj at 10 AM. 10) List all the kinds and scales of buoyancy waves that are observed near the entrainment zone and lower FA.; 280 K. This air is advecting from land to warmer water (9  290 K) with a meanwind speed of M  5 rns. Over land, there is no flux into the bottom of the ML and no entrainment into the top. Over water, the flux at the bottom can be approximated with a bulk transfer relationship (use Co  CH  10.3 as the bulk transfer coefficient). The flux ratio method can be used to model entrainment at the top of the ML. (Neglect subsidence. and assume that the inversion capping the ML has a constant strength of;wind speed of M  5 rns. Over land, there is no flux into the bottom of the ML and no entrainment into the top. Over water, the flux at the bottom can be approximated with a bulk transfer relationship (use Co  CH  10.3 as the bulk transfer coefficient). The flux ratio method can be used to model entrainment at the top of the ML. (Neglect subsidence. and assume that the inversion capping the ML has a constant strength offlO  2 K.) Howdo the thickness and temperature measured I km downwind from the shoreline vary with speed (your answer can be in word andor equation form, although no numbers need be found)?
