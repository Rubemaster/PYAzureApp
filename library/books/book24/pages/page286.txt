If one neglects the last tenn in (7.5.20, then substitution of (7.5.20 back into (7.5.1 b  c) yields the PriestlyTaylor parameterization;(7.5.2h)where the parameter aPT is introduced to make up for neglecting the last tenn in (7.5.20, and to allow the equations to be used for unsaturated conditions (DeBruin and Keijamn, 1979 DeBruin, 1983). For wellwatered surfaces, aPT  1.25. The PriestleyTaylor method can yield incorrect fluxes when advection is happening. Although one possible fix is to increase the magnitude of aPT ,many investigators (McNaughton, 1976a  b Singh and Taillefer, 1986) prefer to add an additional;where the parameter aPT is introduced to make up for neglecting the last tenn in (7.5.20, and to allow the equations to be used for unsaturated conditions (DeBruin and Keijamn, 1979 DeBruin, 1983).
