For example, the leaves of many trees, plants, and crops can form a canopy elevated above the ground surface. If we imagine that a large box could be placed over one whole plant or tree that would just touch the top and sides of the plant, then the volume of this box represents the space taken by the plant. Of course, most of this space is filled by air between the leaves and branches. The total surface area of the plant, including the area of both sides of each leaf can theoretically be measured or estimated. The area density 0 roughness elements, Sr is defined as the plant surfacearea divided by the space volume. A dimensionless canopy density, C  can be defined by;(7.4.1g)where cm is the drag coefficient associated with an individual roughness element (cm ;0.05 to 0.5 for typical plants and crops), and h is the average height of the canopy (Kondo and Kawanaka, 1986).  The variation of bulk transfer coefficients with canopy density is shown in Fig 7.7. As expected, the value of the transfer coefficients increase as the canopy density increases, corresponding to more roughness elements. For dimensionless canopy densities greater than about 0.4 to 1.0, however, the bulk transfer coefficients decrease. This happens when the roughness elements are so close together that they begin to appear to the wind as a solid smooth surface displaced above the true ground. Another measure of the surface roughnes is the aerodynamic roughness length, 20, which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. It is on the order of centimeters over grass and crops, and on the order of meters over sparse forests and
