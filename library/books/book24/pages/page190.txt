How deep is the turbulence?;Solution. We can use the gradient Richardson number as an indicator of dynamic stability and turbulence. Using the prescribed gradients, we find that; iJay g e iJz  cI (0.033)(0.03) a 2 2 2 Ri v v z (0.00099 m ) z;If we use Rc  0.25, then we can use this critical value in place of Ri above and solve for z at the critical height above which there is no turbulencez  J ( 1010 m2) Rc  J 252.5 m2  15.9 m;Discussion. If we has used a critical termination value of RT  1.0, then we would have found a critical height of 31.8 m. Thus, below 15.9 m we expect turbulence, while above 31.8 m we expect laminar flow. Between these heights the turbulent state depends on the past history of the flow at that height. If previously turbulent, it is turbulent now.;The Obukhov length (L) is a scaling parameter that is useful in the surface layer. To show how this parameter is related to the TKE equation, first recall that one definition of the surface layer is that region where turbulent fluxes vary by less that 10 of their magnitude with height. By making the constant flux (with height) approximation, one can use surface values of heat and momentum flux to define turbulence scales and nondimensionalize the TKE equation.;Start with the TKE equation (5.1 a), multiply the whole equation by (k zu.3), assume all turbulent fluxes equal their respective surface valus  and focus on just terms III, IV, and VII;Start with the TKE equation (5.1 a), multiply the whole equation by (k zu.3), assume all turbulent fluxes equal their respective surface valus  and focus on just terms III, IV, and VIIk z g (wa v )s kz(u.u) iJU. k z fls  I J s I  (5.7a) a 3 3 ax. u2 v u.
