The evaporation term in (3.4.5b) does not appear because phase change is already incorporated into the definition of the liquid water static energy. The fluxes at the top of a ML are found using the entrainment parameterizations;(13.1.3d)where .1EZ( ) is the usual jump across the top of the ML. Rogers, et al. (1985a) suggest the following parameterization for fluxes at the surface (in this case, over an ocean);The buoyancy flux is needed to calculate TKE production, entrainment production vs. consumption, or to find scaling variables such as w .

For cloudy air;Buoyancy variables such as Sv can be computed (using iteration) from the variables listed in Table 131 (see Example 13.1.6).
