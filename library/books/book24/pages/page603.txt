(a) Transition between equilibrium IBL and PBL aloft (after Rao, et aI., 1974 and HOgstrOm and HOgstrOm, 1978). (b) Deceleration of the upwind profile near the change from smooth to rough (after Claussen, 1987).;When air flows from a smooth surface to a rough surface, the air in the IBL decelerates. This results in horizontal convergence and upward motion above the boundary between smooth and rough (Fig 14.12). Similarly, flow from rough to smooth causes divergence and subsidence. These vertical motions interact with other convective motions and affect pollutant transport. A convergencedivergence dipole is often observed at the upwinddownwind borders of cities, because of the change in roughness. Upwind of a surface change from smooth to rough the friction velocity decreases slightly, then has a step increase overshooting its final equilibrium value, and finally decays to a final equilibrium state that is larger than the friction velocity over the smooth surface (Claussen, 1987). Turbulence kinetic energy also increases in a shallow layer at the point of roughness increase, then the layer of increased TKE grows in thickness as the IBL grows, and finally the surface value decreases to a new equilibrium value that is
