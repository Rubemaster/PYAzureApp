Find the autocorrelation for relative humidity, h,rh(L), for time lags ranging from 0 to 48 hours, and plot the result.;As can be seen in a plot of the time series (Fig 8.2a), there are regular diurnal cycle oscillations superimposed on longer period trends.;Solution There are 32 data points, with dt  3 h. We must solve (8.2.1) 17 different times, for j  0 through j  16. The result is;L(h) Rrh.rh o 1.00 3 0.67 6 0.47;L(h) R rhrh 18 0.49 21 0.53 24 0.50;Discussion Looking at Fig 8.2b, we see that the autocorrelation starts at 1.0 at zero lag, and quickly decreases. As is sometimes the case with weather data, the diurnal cycle shows up as an oscillation in the autocorrelation function with a 24 hour period. We could have anticipated this, because 12 h from any time, the humidity time series is in the
