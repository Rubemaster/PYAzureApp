If the kinematic heat flux into the bottom of this layer is 0.2 K mls and the flux out of the top is 0.1 K mis, then what is the potential temperature of that layer 2 hours later? Assume that the potential temperature is constant with height in the layer. (This is a thought question, meant to stimulate the students ability to interpret a physical situation in an acceptable mathematical framework.) 9) Given the typical variation of wind speed with height within the surface layer (see Chapt 1), and using a development similar to that in section 2.7
