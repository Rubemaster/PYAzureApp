This is the answer to the first part of the problem. Note that for frequencies greater than 4, the Fourier transform is just the complex conjugate of the frequencies less than 4. As a check of our transform, we can perform the inverse transform using (8.4.la) directly in a computer program. Otherwise, we can use Eulers formula to write it as;In actuality there are four sums, not just the two listed above. The remaining sums consist of the real part of F times the imaginary factor isin(. .. ), and the imaginary part of F times the real factor cos( ... ). Because the last half of the Fouier transforms are the complex conjugates of the first half (not counting the mean), these two sums identically cancel, leaving the two listed above. Upon perfonning the calculations for A(k). we do indeed reproduce the original time series.;Discussion To graphically demonstrate that the sum of these sines and cosines does indeed equal our original series. Fig 8.5 shows each individual wave multiplied by its appropriate amplitude. As can be seen. the reconstructed time series fits perfectly the eight original data points. In between these points, however. the sum oscillates in a manner that is not necessarily realistic. but which is irrelevant because it occurs below the discretization resolution specified by the original data points.;0 .... f. .0 , ..
