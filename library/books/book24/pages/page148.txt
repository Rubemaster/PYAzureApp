Remembering that i and k can each talce on three values, that means (4.4.1a or b) represents 9 separate equations. Thus, the above equations can be used to forecast each of the nine tenns in the Reynolds stress tensor. although as stated in Chapt. 2 the number of independent terms is reduced to 6 by symmetries. As an example of an application of this equation for one tenn. choose a coordinate system aligned with the mean wind.
