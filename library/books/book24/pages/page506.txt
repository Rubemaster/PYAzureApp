The boundary layer can become stably stratified whenever the surface is cooler than the air. This stable boundary layer (SBL) often forms at night over land, where it is known as a nocturnal boundary layer (NBL). It can also form by advection of warmer air over a cooler surface. The balance between mechanical generation of turbulence and damping by stability varies from case to case, creating stable boundary layers that range from being well mixed to non turbulent. Sometimes the SBL turbulence is sporadic and patchy, allowing the upper ponions of the boundary layer to decouple from surface forcings. As a result of this complexity, the SBL is difficult to describe and model, and some of the concepts presented in this chapter will change with future research.;Fig 12.1 shows typical profiles of mean variables in the SBL for the case of weak turbulent mixing. The greatest static stability is near the ground, with stability decreasing smoothly toward neutral with height. If stabilities are great enough near the surface to cause temperatures to increase with height, then that ponion of the SBL is classified as a temperature inversion. In fact, sometimes the whole SBL is loosely called a nocturnal in version.
