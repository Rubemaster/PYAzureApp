(3) The inverse of the Ozmidov scale defines the buoyancy wavenumber, which separates the buoyancy subrange (middle wavenumbers) from the inertial subrange (high wavenumbers). At wavenumbers higher than the buoyancy wavenumber, eddies do not feel the static stability directly, are threedimensional, and obey 53 power law inertialsubrange scaling lCS(lC) DC lCW as in Fig 12.22).;Fig. 12.22 Idealized spectral shape for vertical velocity variance or potential temperature variance for a mixture of waves and turbulence in a SBl.

Between the buoyancy and inertial subranges there is evidence of a gap. This gap is even more apparent in the potential temperature spectrum (NaiPing, 1983). One possible explanation (Finnigan, et aI., 1984) for the gap is that the energy transfer in the inertial subrattge towards lower wavenumbers is blocked at the 3 power law region, leading to a buildup of energy near the buoyancy wavenumber. Many real atmospheric spectra might be affected by waves at more than one wavelength. The resulting spectrum would be very complex, and would be a function of the relative strengths of the different waves. In addition, Mahrt and Gamage (1987) have found that mesoscale forcings can dominate at low wavenumbers.
