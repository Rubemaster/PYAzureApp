for j  1 and 2.h fae  U.dz J ax. o J (12.2.4d);Traditional means of measuring advection must be used with care, because advection will tend to follow isentropic surface, except where the surfaces touch the ground or where there is mixing in the vertical. The synoptic rawinsonde network might not offer sufficient resolution in the vertical nor horizontal to adequately measure the advection at night. There is no simple way to parameterize this term. It must be calculated direcdy using a 3D (mesoscale) forecast model, or it must be measured directly.;The combined effects of turbulence, radiation. subsidence and advection cause the SBL to evolve as sketched in Fig 12.12. Shortly after surface cooling starts (e.g., evening), a shallow weak SBL forms, leaving a deep residual layer above it. Gradually, the SBL becomes deeper by the cooling of the lower residual layer. The strength also increases until such time as the surface cooling stops (e.g., morning). The example shown in Fig 12.12 corresponds to one of relatively weak contiguous turbulence. The evolution of accumulated cooling, es HAG. within the continuouslycontiguously turbulent SBL is given by a heat balance of all the forcings a (eS  HAG) at  QH  QR  Qw  QA (12.3.1a);(After Stull, 1983). 200 ! .  ) 100  .118;(After Stull, 1983). 200 ! .  ) 100  .118local limo ,!... o 15 10 5 0 69 (OK)
