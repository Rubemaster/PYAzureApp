1) Assume the following PBL initial conditions time is 1800 local, temperature soundingis adiabatic (6300 K) up to z  1 km, above which the lapse rate is y  116t.z  0.01 Kim. Also, assume the following boundary conditions B  10 mK (bulk NBL turbulence parameter), no subsidence, no winds during daytime, and a surface heat flux vs time as plotted below;is adiabatic (6300 K) up to z  1 km, above which the lapse rate is y  116t.z  0.01 Kim. Also, assume the following boundary conditions B  10 mK (bulk NBL turbulence parameter), no subsidence, no winds during daytime, and a surface heat flux vs time as plotted beloww9s (K mts);(a) Forecast and plot the depth of the PBL (RL, NBL, and ML) as a function of time for the full 24 h period. starting at 1800 local time on Day 1, and ending at 1800 local time on Day 2. (b) Also plot the potential temperature profiles at 0600 and 1800 local times for Day 2. 2) What are typical response times of the stable (nocturnal) boundary layer and the mixed layer. and how does the flow vary with these response times?;3) Given 6  5 C at sunset (1800 local time)  constant with height. The following are constant with time during the night p.  100 kPa (surface pressure);U g  5 ms (geostrophic wind speed) Z,  5000 m (roughness scale) em  0.02 K ms (surface kinematic heat flux) fc  104 sl (Coriolis parameter) An orchard owner hires you to forecast the near surface air temperature. because she is concerned about freeze damage to the fruit. Will the nearsurface air temperature reach freezing on this night? If so. when? (Hint Neglect moisture and direct radiative cooling of the trees).
