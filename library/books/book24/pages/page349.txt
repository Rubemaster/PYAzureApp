340 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYbecomes nearly constant with height in the top half of the mixed layer. The mixing length is undefined in the non turbulent air above the mixed layer, because the process spectral amplitudes are zero.;2000 Fig. 8.15 Mixing length 1500 profile computed E using process spectral amplitudes ... as weights for the 1000 respective eddy sizes. 500;Although we have concentrated on discrete spectral methods in this chapter, an obvious extension is to use integrals to describe the Fourier transform pair for continuous functions. In the following example, we will decompose the original function A(t,x) into a Fourier integral in a single spatial direction, x, but will not perform a similar decomposition in time. For this case, the Fourier transform pair is;Inverse Transform A(t,x)  f F(t,K) e in dK (8.11.1 a);Forward Transform F( 1 f iKX t,K)  21t A(t,x) e dx (8.11.1 b);Forward Transform F( 1 f iKX t,K)  21t A(t,x) e dx (8.11.1 b)where K is wavenumber. Substitution of (S.l1.1a) into a term like aA(t,x)ax yields;where K is wavenumber.
