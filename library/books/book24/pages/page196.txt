Static and dynamic stability concepts are intertwined, as sketched in Fig 5.24a. Negative Richardson numbers always correspond to statically and dynamically unstable flow. This flow will definitely become turbulent. Positive Richardson numbers are always statically stable, but there is the small range of 0  Ri  1 where positive Richardson numbers are dynamically unstable, and may be turbulent depending on the past history of the flow. Namely, nonturbulent flow will become turbulent at about Ri  0.25, while flow that is presently turbulent will stay turbulent if Ri  1.;Fig. 5.24 Stability parameter relationships (see text).
