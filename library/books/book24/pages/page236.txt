Fig. 6.9 a Examples of idealized transilient matrices showing nonlocal mixing possibilities. The arrows are not physical eddies, but they represent the net mixing effect of many real eddies acting in 3D space.

(b) Contour plot of the same tranSilient matrix elements. (c) PhYSical interpretation of the transilient matrix. All presentations are flipped upsidedown such that the top of the boundary layer is at the top of the vertical axis of the presentation. Contours indicate the percentage of air moving from any source location to any destination, where top is 2400 m above ground. and where the ML is 1600 m thick. After Ebert et al. (1989).
