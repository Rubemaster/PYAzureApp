STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER 537analysis nonstationary, advectivegravity, near equilibrium, shooting, combination, combination with friction, tranquil, and nongravity, only two of which will be reviewed here. For advectivegravity flows, only tenns II and V are important. This flow is constant with time, but is a function of downslope distance. The average wind speed over the depth of the flow using averaging like (12.7.2), except integrated from 0 to hdJ is; g e . ll2 U  e ,x,slO(a) (12.7.2c); g e . ll2 U  e ,x,slO(a) (12.7.2c)where x is downslope distance. Briggs (1979) suggested a similar equation, but using the surface heat flux instead of the average potential temperature departure;U  2.15 sin(a) 29  f(w es) x  (12.7.2d);He also suggested that the depth of the flow is given byhd  0.037 sin(a) 213 x (12.7.2e);For equilibrium flows, the pull of gravity is balanced by frictional drag at the top and bottom of the flow (i.e., tenns V and VIII are important). These flows are constant in both space and time. The equilibrium average wind speed is 12;U   g (89) sin(a) hd C C (12.7.2f) eg 0  Oh;U   g (89) sin(a) hd C C (12.7.2f) eg 0  Ohwhere COh is like a drag coefficient, except at the top of the flow COh  uw h I Ucq.;At the start of this chapter, we explored some of the problems associated with SBl modeling. These included factors such as long time scales, turbulence bursting, zl e ss scaling, inertial oscillations, and now drainage flows. Most of these processes were examined in an idealized scenario in which the other processes were neglected. In the real atmosphere, however, many of these processes can occur simultaneously, making the SBL behavior very difficult to describe. For example, the accumulated cooling method of examining SBL growth assumes that none of the chilled air is drained away downslope. The downslope flows neglected inertial oscillations. The relationship between fog formation and drainage flow could be
