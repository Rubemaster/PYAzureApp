Precipitationleaving the parcel reduces rT. but not ge. Radiative cooling affects ge but not rT Mixing between two different air parcels results in a mixture parcel that falls on the mixing line, a straight line connecting the thermodynamic states of the two original parcels. The ponion of each original parcel in the final mixture is represented by the relative position along the mixing line. Fig 13.2 shows a ge  rT diagram for data from the CCOPE experiment in Montana. It is clear that a deep layer between about 85 lcPa (850 mb) and almost 60 lcPa (600 mb) is undergoing mixing, because the data falls along a mixing line. This mixing includes both the subcloud boundary layer and the vigorous cumulus convection above. At cloud top levels (60 to 50 lcPa) radiative cooling dominates.;Fig. 13.2 Conserved parameter diagram for two soundings on 6 AUQust 1981 , dunnQ CCOPE, shOWing lower troposphere mixing line structure.
