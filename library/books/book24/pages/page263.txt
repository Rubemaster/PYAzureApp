Equation (7.2a) is in energy flux units such as Im,2s! or Wm,2, while (7.2b) is in kinematic units such as Kms!. Thus, the second equation is just the fIrst equation;Equation (7.2a) is in energy flux units such as Im,2s! or Wm,2, while (7.2b) is in kinematic units such as Kms!. Thus, the second equation is just the fIrst equationdivided by pC. From section 2.6, we recall that QH  (w 9 )., and QE  (lyCp);Very complex processes can occur within our imaginary layer (Geiger, 1965 Oke, 1978 Brutsaert, 1985), such as radiation between leaves, plants, buildings, and animals turbulent circulations different from those higher in the boundary layer vertical variations of the sensible and latent heat flux associated with evaporation and condensation and transpiration. Because of this complexity, we have employed the simplification of a layer into which the net effect of all of these processes can be lumped together as Qs. Sometimes, we prefer to conceptually employ an infmitesimally thin layer, as sketched in Fig 7.2b. This is not a really layer, but a plane. The resulting surface heat budget is;Fig. 7.3 Typical variation of terms of the surface energy balance for (a) daytime over land (b) nighttime over land (c) oasis effect of warm dry air advection over a moist surface and (d) daytime over the sea with no advection.
