162 BOUNDARYLAYERMETEOROLOOYprofiles show a maximum of we at zzj  0.3 to 0.5 . Below this maximum, there is more upward flux leaving the top of anyone layer than enters from below. making a net divergence or loss of TKE. Above the maximum, there is a net convergence or production of TKE. The net effect is that some of the TKE produced near the ground is transported up to the top half of the ML before it is dissipated, as confmned in Fig 5.4. Transport across the surface layer is illustrated in the right portion of Fig 5.9, where the Obukhov length L will be defined in section 5.7. If one splits the vertical turbulent transport of total TKE into transport of w2 and (u2v2), then one finds that it is the vertical transport of w2 that dominates in the middle of the ML, and the transport of (u2v2) that dominates near the surface. Fig 5.10 shows these transports, as well as their ratio.;Turbulence. Static pressure fluctuations are exceedingly difficult to measure in the atmosphere. The magnitudes of these fluctuations are very small, being on the order of 0.005 kPa (0.05 mb) in the convective surface layer to 0.001 kPa (0.01 mb) or less in the ML. Pressure sensors with sufficient sensitivity to measure these static pressure fluctuations are contaminated by the large dynamic pressure fluctuations associated with turbulent and mean motions. As a result, correlations such as wp calculated from experi!Uental data often contain more noise than signal.;Fig. 5.11 (a) 150 (a) CompoSite 01 130 measured  Ii circulation patterns 110  ..;Fig. 5.11 (a) 150 (a) CompoSite 01 130 measured  Ii circulation patterns 110  ..in a vertica crosssection thru .. 90 ,, convective thermals.
