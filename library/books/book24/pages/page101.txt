By moving this flux term to the right hand side of the equation, we see something very remarkable namely, the following forecast equation for mean wind is very similar to the basic conservation equation we started with (3.2.3b), except for the addition of the turbulence term at the end.;By moving this flux term to the right hand side of the equation, we see something very remarkable namely, the following forecast equation for mean wind is very similar to the basic conservation equation we started with (3.2.3b), except for the addition of the turbulence term at the end.aU j oU j U .  Vi J vX j;Term I represents storage of mean momentum (inertia).o(u.u.) I J;Term II describes advection of mean momentum by the mean wind. Term ill allows gravity to act in the vertical direction only. Term IV describes the influence of the earths rotation (Coriolis effects). Term V describes the mean pressuregradient forces. Term VI represents the influence of viscous stress on the mean motions.;Term X represents the influence of Reynolds stress on the mean motions (see section 2.9.2). It can also be described as the divergence of turbulent momentum flux.;The implication of this last term is that turbulence must be considered in making forecasts in the turbulent boundary layer, even if we are trying to forecast only mean quantities. Term X can often be as large in magnitude, or larger, than many other terms in the equation. Sometimes term X is labled as P by largescale dynamists to denote friction.;Por total specific humidity, start with (3.2.4a) and split the dependent variables into mean and turbulent parts
