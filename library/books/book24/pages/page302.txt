9) State some reasons why one might need to use geostrophic drag relationships. 10) Problems 10 and II are identical to the solved examples in the text We recommend that the instructor modify the problem to any other location and time of interest to the students. What is the value of the net radiation (Q) absorbed at the earths surface as a function of time (for a 24 hour period) under the folJowing conditions albedo  0.2 location  farmland near Wausau, Wisconsin date  April 9, 1982 cloudcover low 10 mid  0 high  60 Plot your result (start the graph at 6 AM). 11) Given the following conditions same situation as problem (10). deep soil temperature is 10C. soil is dry (QE  0). BL remains 1 Ian thick. potential temperature is constant with height (but not time). no advection or entrainment into the BL Initial conditions (at 6 AM) T air  8.4C, and To  4.5C Calculate and plot the following as a function of time for a 24 hour period starting at 6 AM. Use the forcerestore method for the ground temperature, and turbulence equations for mean flow for the air temperature. a) Tair b) To c) Qo d) QH
