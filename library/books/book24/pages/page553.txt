For air at a pressure level P, the saturation level is found by dry (moist) adiabatic ascent (descent) of an unsaturated air parcel (a saturated cloud parcel) to the pressure level, P sp where the parcel is just saturated with no cloud liquid water (Betts, 1982ab, 1985). This level is also known as the lifting condensation level (LCL) for rising unsaturated air parcels, and often defines cloud base. The temperature of an air parcel when moved to this level is symbolized as T sp. On a thermodynamic diagram, the point represented by (PsP Tsp) is called the saturation point (SP).
