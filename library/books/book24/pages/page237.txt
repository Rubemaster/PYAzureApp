  N   .  .  r. c ..  .. This is satisfied by (6.8.2a). J  JIJ J Also, if the amount of tracer initially in box j is conserved as it mixes out of j and into the other boxes, i, then conservation of tracer amount requires that;One way to appreciate this constraint is to picture a column of air with no tracers in anybox, except for a unit amount of tracer in one box (j  I). If all of the tracer is initially in box j, then after the mixing associated with one time step, some of this tracer could be mixed into any or all of the other boxes. Nevertheless, the total amount of tracer in all;box, except for a unit amount of tracer in one box (j  I). If all of the tracer is initially in box j, then after the mixing associated with one time step, some of this tracer could be mixed into any or all of the other boxes. Nevertheless, the total amount of tracer in allboxes must still sum to unity C.  I). The only way that this is possible given mixing .1  defined by (6.8.1) is if (6.8.2b) is true. We see that (6.8.2a  b) are conservation constraints for air mass and tracer mass. In addition, none of the individual elements cij should be allowed to be negative, otherwise turbulence would cause unmixing and would decrease randomness or entropy. Thus, each element of the matrix must be 0  cij  I, and each row and each column must sum to one. Such a matrix is sometimes called a doubly stochastic matrix.
