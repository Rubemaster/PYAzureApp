Comparing the above set of equations to the original shorthand version, we begin to appreciate the power of Einsteins summation notation. This tool will be used throughout the remaining chapters. It is analogous to vector notation, which is examined in the next section. Usually, the shorthand (summation) form of (2.8.2b) is written as follows;Discussion of Problem 4. Comparing the above set of equations to the original shorthand version, we begin to appreciate the power of Einsteins summation notation. This tool will be used throughout the remaining chapters.

This is the form that will be used for the remainder of the text. Finally, we should recognize that a whole term is a scalar, vector, or tensor if the term has zero, one, or two unsummed (free) variable indices, respectively. For example, the;where vectors like Ui have three components (U, V, W), and where (i, j, k) are indices, not unit vectors. This is the form that will be used for the remainder of the text. Finally, we should recognize that a whole term is a scalar, vector, or tensor if the term has zero, one, or two unsummed (free) variable indices, respectively. For example, thefc Eij3 Uj term in the equation above is a vector, because there is only one unsummed variable index, i.;Vectors can represent three Cartesian components, and tensors can represent nine. There is a onetoone correspondence between vector definitions and Einsteins summation notation, as might be expected. The following is an explanation of how vectors can be rewritten in summation notation, and how vector operations such as the dot and cross product can be represented. In these examples, vector operations apply only to the vector parts of each term scalar parts can be separated and interpreted as simple products. The definitions below relate basic vector forms (especially, unit vectors) and operators to summation notation
