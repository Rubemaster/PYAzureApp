Hanson and Derr (1987) have proposed the following simplified parameterization for solar radiation absorption. It is assumed that the heights of cloud top and base are known (zT and zB respectively).;1 (  z)  1  ex A   ( K.). sol;W  pz,f Pair rL dz B ( zB) 2 880 (13.2.1c);z,f Pair rL dz B ( zB) 2 880 (13.2.1c)where the last approximation gives W p in units of gm2, for cloud heights in units of m. The liquid water mixing ratio is assumed to increase linearly with height from cloud base to cloud top, associated with moist adiabatic ascent. This latter assumption appears
