Solution Although this data set exhibits a variety of magnitudes over a range of heights, each of the individual data curves has the same shape (see Fig 9.3a)  a clue that they are created by a common physical process that could possibly be described empirically.;W,2W2  (a) Hypothetical sample of vertical profiles of w (b) Profiles of w from (a) scaled by free convection similarity. The range of the curves is shaded.;The tabulated data includes mixed layer depth and surface heat flux. From these, wecan calculate the length and velocity scales,  and w., assuming glav  0.0333 ms2K 1.;Using Buckingham Pi analysis, or by inspection for this simple case, we can create thefollowing dimensionless groups z!zi, and w,2w.2. When the original data is replotted;following dimensionless groups z!zi, and w,2w.2. When the original data is replottedin this dimensionless framework, 10 and behold most of the data points collapse into a single curve, as plotted in Fig 9.3b. Thus, all of the data are similar, allowing us to use similarity theory. By trial and error using simply power laws, we find that the following equation approximates the shape of the data, and is ploued as the curve in Fig 9.3b;2 w. 17 (,J 2fJ ( I  0.8 ,J 2;This equation is almost identical to (9.6.3c), except for the value of the regression coefficient (Le., 1.7 vs. 1.8).
