Spectrum analysis is a statistical tool that we can employ to probe further into the workings of turbulence. By decomposing a series of measurements into frequency or wavenumber components, we can discover how eddies of different time and space scales contribute to the overall turbulence state. In this chapter we review the computational techniques for the spectrum analysis of measured data. We also introduce related tools such as the autocorrelation function, structure function, and periodogram. Also discussed is the concept of a process spectrum, where mixing processes rather than turbulence states are decomposed into a spectrum of scales. Theoretical spectral decomposition of the TKE equation is briefly covered.;When measurements are taken at a fixed point over a period of time, the resulting series of data points is called a time series. Similarly, measurements at a fixed time over a series of locations in space is called a space series. Both series give measurements of a dependent variable such as temperature or humidity as a function of an independent variable, such as time, t, or location, x. Because of this similarity, we will discuss the two types of series interchangeably, and sometimes will use the generic name, series.
