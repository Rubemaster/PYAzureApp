 .. E  Q) a (,) U);Fig. 11.34 Three dimensional histogram of absolute diveence magnitude plotted as a function of both scale and relative frequency of occurence for a variety of sensors deployed 10 BLX83. The demarcation between the dark and light areas represents the median value of divergence for each sensor. The size of the area (m2) over which divergence was measured by each sensor appears along the scale axis. (After Vachalek, et aI., 1988).
