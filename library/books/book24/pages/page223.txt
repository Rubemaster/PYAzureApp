Discussion. Although the Ekman solution is analytic and has been around for a long time, the conditions under which it was derived rarely happen in nature in the atmosphere. At best, it gives an approximate quantitative solution for statically neutral boundary layers (i.e., mechanical turbulence production characteristic of strong winds, with no buoyancy effects). For convective mixed layers, the Ekman profile dJJlx is not observed, although it qualitatively agrees with the observed winds, which are subgeostrophic and crossisobaric. Observed stable boundary layers can have supergeostrophic winds at low altitudes, making the Ekman solution even qualitatively incorrect.;Oneandahalforder closure retains the prognostic equations for the zeroorder statistics such as mean wind, temperature, and humidity, and also retains equations for the variances of those variables. The TKE equation is usually used in place of the velocity variance equations. The following development is based on the work of Yamada  Mellor (1975). As an example, consider the idealized scenario of a dry environment, horizontally homogeneous, with no subsidence. The governing prognostic equations are (3.5.3) for the zeroorder variables, (4.3.3) for the temperature variance, and (5.1 b) for TKE;Oneandahalforder closure retains the prognostic equations for the zeroorder statistics such as mean wind, temperature, and humidity, and also retains equations for the variances of those variables.
