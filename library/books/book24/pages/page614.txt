GEOORAPIllC EFFECTS 609solar heating of one valley wall compared to the other can modify the turbulence intensity and stress (Carlson and Foster, 1986). Pollutant dispersion in complex terrain is difficult to model, and additional research is needed in this area (Egan and Schiermeier, 1986). In large cities, tall buildings act like steep valley walls along urban canyons formed by the streets (Oke, 1978). As might be expected, the crisscrossing urban canyons for a very complex urban terrain system, with air being trapped in some canyons and air in others being ducted like windtunnels (Rosker, 1987). Not only is there differential absorption on the various canyon walls (buildings) depending on the sun position, but there can be significant multiple reflections off of the windows and emission of heat from traffic in the street and from buildings (Johnson and Watson, 1984 Steyn and Lyons, 1985). The generation of urban boundary layers is reviewed after the example below.;Problem. Air is flowing from a corn field to a shortcut grass pasture. Row far downwind from the edge of the corn field should a 10 m mast be erected so as to not feel the influence of the corn field (Le., what minimum fetch within the pasture is required). Assume statically neutral conditions, and no change of surface heat flux.;Solution. First, we can estimate the roughness of the two fields using Fig 9.6 for corn, zol  0.06 for cut grass, zo2  0.006. Using (14.2.1b) we can solve for the aIBL parameter ( 0.006) aIBL  0.75  0.0311. 0.06  0.681;Next, we can solve (14.2.1a) for the required fetch, knowing that 0 must be at least 10 m;( 1 0) JbmL (1 10) 10.8 x  zol  3mL z  0.06  0.681 0.06  58 m;Discussion. The mast must be located no less that 58 m from the corn field. If we anticipate a range of stabilities during our measurement, it would be best to locate the mast even further away. Note that the equation for mL depth is not a function of wind speed, because it is assumed that turbulence is more intense and the mL grows faster in a surface layer with greater shear.
