3 BOUNDARYLAYEROROLOGYvariances, and other miscellaneous variables will be presented. Each of these subsections will include relationships for both the boundary layer, and the surface layer. Occasionally, different investigators have suggested different values for the regression coefficients (Le., the universal constants). For these situations a variety of values are listed, separated by commas. Finally, an example will be presented in each Section to demonstrate the application of a similarity relationship.;In the stable surface layer, MoninObukhov similarity has allowed us describe the vertical profiles of some variables as a function of the dimensionless group zL (Businger, et aI., 1971 Wyngaard, et aI., 1971 Caughey, et aI., 1979). Higher in the SBL, zless scaling is more appropriate (Wyngaard, 1973 Nieuwstadt, 1984 Lascer and Arya, 1986 Sorbjan, 1986, 1987). Sorbjan (1987) has shown how it is possible to develop SBL similarity expressions from the corresponding surface layer expressions. All of these relationships assume that the SBL is continuously turbulent in time and space, with no gaps or patches of nonturbulent air. Since real SBLs can have sporadic, patchy turbulence, we must recognize the limitations of the expressions below.;9.4.1 Mean Variables and Their Gradients;In many cases it is difficult to describe the profiles of mean variables because of the influence of initial and boundary conditions. However, the profiles often exhibit a common shape, allowing similarity expressions to be derived for the gradients of mean variables.
