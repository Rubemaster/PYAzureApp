For example, the standard atmospheric air density is 1.225 kgm3 at sea level and 1.112 kgm3 at lOOOm, a difference of only 10. These kinematic fluxes are now expressed in units that we can measure directly wind speed for mass and momentum fluxes temperature and wind speed for heat flux and specific humidity (q) and wind speed for moisture flux. The pollutant flux is frequently expressed in either form concentration and wind speed, or mass ratio (like parts per million, ppm) and wind speed. Each of these fluxes can be split into three components. For example, there might be a vertical component of heat flux, and two horizontal components of heat flux, as sketched in Fig 2.10. Similar fluxes could be expected for mass, moisture, and pollutants. Hence, we can picture these fluxes as vectors .;.  T . .......  .  .. .. ... . , ... .. .

(b) If a greater flux enters a volume than leaves, then there must be a net increase of that quantity within the volume.;For momentum, we have the added dimension that the flux in anyone direction might be the flux of U, V or W momentum (see Fig 2.11). This means that there are nine components of this flux to consider each of the three momentum components can pass
