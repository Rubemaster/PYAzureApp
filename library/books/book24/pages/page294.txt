BOUNDARY CONDmONS 285at great depths. The solution is a periodic temperature variation that decreases in amplitude with depth, and increases phase lag with depth, as is sketched in Fig 7.18. If the period of the cycle is P, then the amplitude AT of the wave changes with depth as;For more realistic nonperiodic forcings or nonunifonn soil properties, (7.6.2c) can be solved with a variety of numerical schemes, analytical series expansions or Fourier decompositions. In this way, variations in thennal diffusivity can be included to allow for changes in soil moisture. Since soil moisture depends on precipitation, evaporation, water table level, runoff, and the transpiration of plants, a full detailed parameterization of the soil process often becomes quite complicated.;Because most of the soil temperature changes occur within a shallow layer near the surface, Blackadar (1976, 1979 Zhang and Anthes, 1982 Anthes, et al., 1987) suggested a twolayer approximation, where a shallow slab of soil is bounded below by a thick constanttemperature slab (see Fig 7.19).
