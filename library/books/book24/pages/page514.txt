Water vapor is the most important constituent controlling the infrared radiation budget, with carbon dioxide playing a smaller role. In spite of the importance of water vapor, the radiation budget is rather insensitive to the exact amount of moisture present, unless the air becomes saturated and fog or stratocumulus forms. Typical values of net longwave radiative flux (positive upward) are about 100 Wm2 in the boundary layer. The radiative flux increases slightly with height, as shown in Fig 12.6a, resulting in flux divergence and radiative cooling at every height. Greater flux divergence often occurs in the lowest tens of meters. The flux divergence and radiative cooling are related by oel  oJ atl az radiative;(12.2.1a)which is a simplification of (3.5.30.;300  investigators suggest So So that there is heating, N 200 200 N rather than cooling, in the air near the lround 100 00 hown dashed In (b.

Within a few meters of the ground the cooling rate increases to 1 to 3 Kh in many cases. Temperature inversions near the ground, however, can occasionally lead to radiative heating from the warmer air aloft.;Models. It is beyond the scope of this book to go into the details of radiative transfer models, other than to briefly discuss some of the general approaches (Cerni and Parish, 1984). (1) The lineby.line approach uses spectralline information to calculate absorption and emission as a function of wavelength. This is the most accurate method, but is also the most computationally expensive. (2) The band method uses average absorption and emission over a smaller number of wavelength bands, and is less
