274 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYnot negligible, fraction of the net radiation, as will be discussed in section 7.6. For now, we will treat (Qs  Qo) as the imposed forcing, which must be partitioned into QH and Oa (7.5);As we saw in Fig. 7.4, both QH and QE reach a peak during midday at roughly the same time as the solar forcing peaks, and are small in the morning and evening. This supports our idea of partitioning. However, a close examination of similar budget data from other sites (Fig. 7.12) suggests that the relative magnitudes of QH and QE vary depending on the wetness and vegetation of the surface. Any parameterization should take this variation into account;(7.5.1a)where Y  CLv  0.0004 (gwate!gair)K1 is the psychrometric constant. As one might expect, p is smaller over moist surfaces where most of the energy goes into evaporation, and larger over dry surfaces where most of the energy goes into sensible heating. Typical values range from 5 over semiarid regions, 0.5 over grasslands and forests, 0.2 over irigated orchards or grass, 0.1 over the sea, to some negative values over oases. It was once suggested that if the Bowen ratio for a surface were known, then (7.5.1a) could be coupled with (7.5) to give;QH  P ( Qs  Qo) (7.5.lb) (1  P); (Q Qo) (7.5.lc) (l  P);Attempts to use this approach have mostly failed, because the Bowen ratio usually varies with time and weather over each site. Furthermore, the evapotranspiration component of latent heat flux from plants is a complex function of the age, health, temperature and water stress of the plant. The pores, or stomates, of the plant open and close to regulate the life processes of the plant. Thus, the stomatel resistance to water flux, or transpiration, also varies.
