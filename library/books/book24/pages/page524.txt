STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER 517where Qr , the total (net) heat flux acting on the bulk SBL, is negative. If Qr were positive, then there would be net heating causing the SBL to be eliminated. During most nights Qr varies significantly with time, requiring (12.3.1) to be integrated numerically. For the special case of constant Qr, we can employ the definition for bulk turbulence together with (12.3a) to analytically solve for the integral depth and strength of the SBL;These equations show that the depth and strength increase with the square root of time, as sketched in Fig 12.13. They also show that a moreturbulent SBL (Le., one with larger B) will be deeper and have less surface cooling than a lessturbulent SBL. The square root of time growth has been observed by Brunt (1939), Brost and Wyngaard (1978), Stull (1983a,b), Brook, 1985), and Surridge and Swanepoel (1987).;With forecasts of 69. and Ht.9 the profile models of Section 12.1.3 can be used to forecast the shape of the potential temperature profile as it evolves throughout the night.;0 (b) g 15 .. 10 CD l 5;Fig. 12.13 (a) Inversion thickness scale and (b) inversion strength eVolution during Wangara Night 67. (After Stull, 1983a).;Problem. Given a clear night with brisk geostrophic winds (G  10 rns) and strongbulk cooling (Or  0.03 K rns) at a location where fc  104 s1 and Z.  4 km, find the bulk depth and strength of the SBL after 6 h. Also plot the resulting potential temperature profiles for the mixed, linear, and exponential models.
