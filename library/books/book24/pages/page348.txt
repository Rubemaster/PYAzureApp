Near the entrainment zone, however, the lapse rate is locally stable, suppressing generation of smallscale mixing except by wind shear. The largest scales continue to be slightly unstable near the entrainment zone, associated with warm thermals rising from the surface layer.;1SOO case as Fig. 8.13, 0.10  2000 showing the  2200 contribution of PS each wavelength to the total mixing at the indicated 0.05;1SOO case as Fig. 8.13, 0.10  2000 showing the  2200 contribution of PS each wavelength to the total mixing at the indicated 0.05height.;Prandtl (1925) recognized that eddies of a variety of sizes can simultaneously operate at any point in the turbulent domain. Due to lack of computer power in the early 1900s, he suggested averaging over the spectrum of eddy sizes to yield one mixing length for each point in space. At the time he had no real measure of the relative importance to the overall mixing length of the various eddy sizes. Instead, he parameterized the mixing length directly as a function of boundary layer and turbulence scales, as discussed in Chapter 6. We can use the process spectrum to examine the relative importance of various scales of mixing to the overall mixing length by applying the processspectral amplitudes as weights for their respective wavelengths. The resulting weighted wavelength is like a mixing length, I, which we can find at each height (z  kz);Fig 8.15 shows mixing lengths as a function of height for the same Cabauw case study. The mixing length, incFe,ase.s with height in the bottom of the mixed layer, but
