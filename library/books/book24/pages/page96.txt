Although subsidence, W, is important in mass conservation and in the advection of material (moisture, pollutants, etc) from aloft, we see that it is less important in the momentum equation because it is always paired in a linear manner with w. In fair weather boundary layers, subsidence can vary from zero to 0.1 mis, which is considered a relatively large value. This is small compared to the vertical velocity fluctuations, which frequently vary over the range 0 to 5 mls. Thus, for only the momentum equation for fairweather conditions can we usually neglect subsidence;Using (3.3.1) to replace the density variations with temperature variations gives;Using (3.3.1) to replace the density variations with temperature variations giveslop    p oz;The physical interpretation of the first two terms in (3.3.3b) is that warmer than average air is accelerated upward (Le., hot air rises). The last two terms describe the influences of pressure gradients and viscous stress on the motion. This equation therefore plays an important role in the evolution of convective thermals.;Thus, the horizontal components of (3.2.3b) become
