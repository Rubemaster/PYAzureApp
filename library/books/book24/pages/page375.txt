Problem In a neutral surface layer with u.  0.2 mis, find the TKE dissipation rate as a function of height.;Solution Rearranging equation (9.5.4b), we can see that the dissipation rate decreases inversely with height;3 u. kz 0.04 23  fiS z for z in meters.;Discussion As verified by the TKE budget figures in Chapter 5, the dissipation rate is indeed very large near the ground. However, the equation above suggests that the dissipation rate is infinite at the surface, which is clearly unrealistic.
