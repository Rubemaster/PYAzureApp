252 BOUNDARY LAYER MEfEOROLOOYturbulent flux has a magnitude equal to that of the molecular flux. Above the lowest few centimeters, however, the molecular contribution is so small that it can be neglected compared to the turbulent flux.;(k)o 02   We (K ms) ..... ;Fig. 7.1 (a) The effective turbulent heat flux using daytime convective conditions as an example, may be nonzero at the surface. (b) This effective flux, however, is the sum of the actual turbulent flux and the molecular flux.;(7.1)where va is the molecular thermal diffusivity (on the order of 2x10S m2s1 for air). For a;where va is the molecular thermal diffusivity (on the order of 2x10S m2s1 for air). For atypical kinematic heat flux of 0.2 KmsI , (7.1) tells us that a temperature gradient of 1x1Q4 Km! is required. This corresponds to a 10 C temperature difference across a micro layer 1 mm thick. Such large gradients are indeed observed. Those of you who have walked barefoot across a black asphalt road on a sunny summer day can testify that the surface skin temperature can become burning hot to the touch, even though the air temperature may be a pleasant 25 or 30 C. The hot skin temperature can create a large temperature grad ient in the lowest millimeters of air. These large gradients in the micro layer are also the cause of the mirage that we sometimes see over highways. From this point on, whenever we refer to a surfacf dubulent flux in this text, we are really implying a surface effective flux. In this way, we can ignore the molecular processes, and just use turbulence equations such as (3.5.3) with the effective flux. As shown in Chapters 1, 3 and 4, the effective flux varies by only a small portion of its magnitude in the lowest tens of meters of the BL. Thus, the turbulent flux measured at the standard surface instrument shelter (screen) height of 2 m provides a good approximation to the effective surface turbulent flux.
