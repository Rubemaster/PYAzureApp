measure this term directly, but sometimes it is modeled as R  (0.036 ms), 9,2  e 32,where R is about 1 to 10 of e (Coanric and Simonin,1984).;Case Study Examples. The temperature variance at the top of the ML (Fig 4.9) is similar to humidity variance, because of the conttast between wanner entrained air and the cooler overshooting thermals. Gravity waves may also contribute to the variance. There is a greater difference near the bottom of the ML, however, because warm thermals in a cooler environment enhance the magnitude of the variance there. At night, Fig 4.10 shows that the largest temperature fluctuations are near the ground in the NBL, with weaker, sporadic turbulence in the RL aloft. Fig 4.11 shows the contributions to the heat budget during daytime, again neglecting storage and advection. The radiation destruction term is small, but definitely nonzero. The dissipation is largest near the ground, as is the turbulent transport of temperature variance. Fig 4.12 shows the corresponding budget terms at night.;(a) Modeled profiles of virtual potential temperature variance dUring Night 3334 of Wangara symbols as in Fig. 4.3(a).
