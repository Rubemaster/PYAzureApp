BOUNDARY CONDmONS 287slab temperature, opposing the radiative forcing. The temperature of the bottom slab, T M, is assumed to be a quasiconstant boundary condition. The ground flux can be found from;( dTO)  CoA T  T  00  COA at  2lt P 0 M (7.6.3c);Both of these equations can be solved numerically by stepping forward in time from some known initial condition. We recognize aFR as a form of conductivity between the ground and the air. Blackadar suggested a magnitude on the order of aFR  2ltP, or 3x 104 SI for To  T air;(e.g., daytime), and lxl04 SI for To  T air (e.g., nighttime). This two layer forcerestore model has become a popular compromise between the more complex multilayer soil model of the previous section, and the overly simplistic approximations of Section 7.6.1 . Deardorff (1978) extended this approach to model soil moisture in order to estimate the latent heat flux.;Problem Make a 24 hour forecast of QH  Qo , To, and Tair for fannland near Wausau, Wisconsin, starting at 12 UTC on 25 April (day 116). Assume a sky covered with 10 low clouds, no middle clouds, and 60 high clouds. Assume that the albedo is 0.2, To  10C, and Zj  1000 m and is constant. For initial conditions, stan with an air temperature of 8.4C and a soil surfaceslab temperature of 4.5C. Assume a dry soil (i.e., no latent heat flux).;Solution To make the desired forecast, we must also specify the net radiative flux Qs. We can utilize the parameterization (7.3.2c) for Q. because we know the latitude and longitude of Wausau (44.97N, 89.63W) and we know the cloud cover. First, we estimate the soil diffusivity to be 5x1O7 m2s, and Cg  1.67xl06 J m3 KI for fannland, based on the tables in Appendix C. Next, we must calculate the values for d. and CoA based on the equations of the previous section. We find that the soil slab depth is ds  5.9 em, and the soil heat capacity per unit area (converted to kinematic units) is CoA  80.33 m, assuming a 24hour time period for the cyclic forcing. Table 76 shows just the first portion of the resulting forecast of fluxes and temperatures, taking a 15 minute timestep. A longer timestep would have lead to errors for this case.
