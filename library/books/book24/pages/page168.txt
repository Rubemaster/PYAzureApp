158 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYassociated with negative values of tenn III. Such conditions are present in the SBL at night over land. or anytime the surface is colder than the overlying air. An example of the decay of turbulence in negatively buoyant conditions just after sunset is shown in the budget profiles of Fig 5.6. This same type of consumption can occur at the top of a ML. where warmer air entrained downward by turbulence opposes the descent because of its buoyancy (Stage and Businger. 1981). This is related to the negative values of the buoyancy tenn near the top of the ML in Fig 5.4.;5.2.4 Term IV Mechanical (Shear) Production;When there is a turbulent momentum flux in the presence of a mean wind shear. the interaction between the two tends to generate more turbulence. Even though a negative sign precedes Tenn IV. the momentum flux is usually of opposite sign from the mean shear. resulting in production. not loss. of turbulence. Fig. 5.4 shows case studies of the contribution of shear production to the TKE budget for convective situations. The greatest wind shear magnitude occurs at the surface. Not surprisingly. the maximum shear production rate also occurs there. As shown in Chapters 1 and 3. the wind speed frequently varies little with height in the ML above the surface layer. resulting in near zero shear and near zero shear production of turbulence. Shear production is often associated with the surface layer because of its limited venical extent. A smaller maximum of shear production sometimes occurs at the top of the ML because of the wind shear across the entrainment zone. In that region. the subgeostrophic winds of the ML recover to their geostrophic values above the ML. The relative contributions of the buoyancy and shear tenns can be used to classify the nature of convection (see Fig 5.7) Free convection scaling is valid when the buoyancy tenn is much larger than the mechanical tenn, forced convection scaling is valid when the opposite is true.
