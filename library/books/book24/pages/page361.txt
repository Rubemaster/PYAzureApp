You might ask which set of Pi groups is the correct set. They are all equally valid, although some Pi groups have become more popular than others in the literature. Our pipe example is a case in point. We can recognize 1t1 as identical to the definition of drag coefficient, Co, while 1t2 is just the inverse of the Reynolds number, Re; p U D  Il. The 1t3 group is called the relative roughness.;This is the end of the formal cookbook procedure for Buckingham Pi Theory. Of course, it is really only the second step of the overall similarity procedure. The next step would be to perform the necessary experiments to discover the relationships between the Pi groups. An example of laboratory pipe flow data is shown in Fig 9.2.;This is the end of the formal cookbook procedure for Buckingham Pi Theory.

First, the stress decreases as the Reynolds number increases, until a critical Reynolds number of about 2100 is reached. This critical Reynolds number marks the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. At lower Reynolds number (laminar flow), the stress is NOT dependent on the relative roughness. As suggested in Section 9.1, the data is telling us that pipe roughness is not relevant for laminar flow. Second, at Reynolds numbers just larger than critical, the stress increases again. Third, as Reynolds number increases further, the stress again decreases with Reynolds
