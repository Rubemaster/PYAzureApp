I J d) The secondorder parameterization by Rotta for the pressure correlation (see Table 65). 25) Without using the assumption that the mixing length is proportional to height above the ground, rederive the mixinglength expression for moisture flux for the case where a solid boundary limits the maximum size of eddies. Hint, use a statistical approach with a probability distribution that is zero beyond the solid boundary. 26) Given the heat flux profiles in Figs 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, and the mean profiles of potential temperature in Figs. 3.4 and 3.5 a) calculate the value for KH as a function of height for  (1) Flight 2 (2) Flight 3 (3) Flight 13 b) Which parameterization in Table 64 best fits the calculated K values from part (a)? 27) For an eddy viscosity of 10 m2s1, and a pressure gradient of 0.2 kPa  100 krn in the atmosphere, plot the Ekman spiral winds as a function of height, and find the Ekman layer depth at a) Bergen, Norway b) Madison, Wisconsin c) Christmas Island (in the Line Islands)
