Next, average the equation, apply Reynolds averaging rules, and use the turbulent continuity equation to put the turbulent advection term into flux form;2 klr u. o d(U.qT)  L...!..  vl q  SqT  J (3.4.4b) at dXj 2  dXj OXj Pair;Term I represents the storage of mean total moisture. Term II describes the advection of mean total moisture by the mean wind. Term VI represents the mean molecular diffusion of water vapor. Term vn is the mean net body source term for additional moisture processes. Term X represents the divergence of turbulent total moisture flux.;, As before, this equation is similar to the basic conservation equation (3.2.4a), except for the addition of the turbulence term at the end. Similar equations can be written for the vapor and nonvapor parts of total specific humidity.;Start with the basic heat conservation equation (3.2.5) and expand the dependent variables into mean and turbulent parts;Start with the basic heat conservation equation (3.2.5) and expand the dependent variables into mean and turbulent partsde oS U. oS U. oS u. oS u. dS     ......L......
