The last term in each of equations (3.5.3c)through (3.5.3g) contains a covariance like u.e or u .c. In order to use those J J previous equations, we can either evaluate the covariances experimentally, or we can derive additional equations to forecast the covariances. In this chapter, prognostic equations are derived for variances and covariances. Variances give us information about turbulence energies and intensities, while covariances describe kinematic turbulent fluxes. While the previous chapter dealt primarily with the mean state, this chapter deals with the turbulent state of the atmosphere.;Turbulent departures of variables are the deviations from their respective means i.e., e, u, v, w, q, and c. In theory, prognostic equations for these departures could be used to forecast each individual gust, given accurate initial and boundary conditions for the gust. Unfortunately, the time span over which such a forecast is likely to be accurate is proportional to the lifetime of the eddy itself  on the order of a few seconds for the smallest eddy to about 15 minutes for the larger thermals. For most meteorological applications, such durations are too short to be of direct use. Instead, we will use the prognostic equations derived in this section as an intermediate step towards finding forecast eql!ations for variances and covariances of the variables.
