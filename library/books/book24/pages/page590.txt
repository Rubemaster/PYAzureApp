584 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOOYe) Calculate the CAPE in units of m2s2 of the actual cloudy air, and for an air parcel rising from cloud base. o Assuming no entrainment, mixing, or friction, what venical velocity would an air parcel have at the limit of convection if it staned at cloud base with an upward velocity of 1 ms? About how far above the LOC would the air parcel overshoot (i.e., where is cloud top)? g) What processes might be responsible for the differences between actual incloud . measurements and the idealized moist parcel ascent?;6) If wsL  0.05 (Jg)(ms) andof the buoyancy flux, ws . y
