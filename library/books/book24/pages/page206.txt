At first glance, the large number of equations developed in Chapters 35 would suggest that we have a fairly complete description of turbulent flow. Unfortunately, a closer examination reveals that there are a large number of unknowns remaining in those equations. These unknowns must be dealt with in order end up with a useful description of turbulence that can be applied to real situations. In this Chapter, the unknowns are identified, and methods to parameterize them are reviewed. Simulation techniques such as largeeddy simulation are discussed in Chapter 10.;As will be demonstrated below, the number of unknowns in the set of equations for turbulent flow is larger than the number of equations. A variable is considered to be unknown if one doesnt have a prognostic or diagnostic equation defining it. When equations are included for these unknowns (changing them to known variables), one discovers even more new unknowns. Thus, for any finite set of those equations the description of turbulence is not closed. Alternately, the total statistical description of turbulence requires an infinite set of equations. This unfortunate conclusion is called the closure problem. It was first recognized in 1924 by Keller and Friedmann, and was associated with the nonlinear characteristic of turbulence. It has remained one of the unsolved problems of classical physics.
