Without a boltom boundary on the atmosphere there would be no boundary layer. Friction at the surface slows the wind, and heat and moisture fluxes from the surface modify the state of the boundary layer. The heat and moisture fluxes are driven, in turn, by the external forcings such as radiation from the sun or transpiration from plants. Forcings across the top of the boundary layer also alter mean characteristics within it. In this chapter we examine some of the external forcings, and show how those forcings and fluxes can be parameterized. Unfortunately, we cannot use any of the methods discussed in Chapter 6, because those methods apply only within a volume of air. For fluxes between a solid surface and air, we need to develop a different set of parameterizations, such as are discussed below.;Turbulence by itself cannot transfer heat, momentum, or moisture across the interface from the ocean or from the earth. After all, it is rather infrequently that we see clods of soil jumping up and down in turbulent motion. Even ocean waves and turbulence have little direct coupling to atmospheric turbulence. Consequently, we must consider molecular effects, in addition to turbulent transport. Molecular conduction of heat, molecular diffusion of tracers, and molecular viscous transfer of momentum cause transport between the surface and the lowest millimeters of air. Once in the air, turbulence takes over to transport momentum, heat and other constituents to greater depths in the atmosphere. The molecular and turbulent transport processes work together as sketched in Fig 7.1. To simplify our equations for boundary layer evolution, we find it convenient to define an effective turbulent flUX that is the sum of the molecular and turbulent fluxes. At the surface where there is no turbulent flux, the effective surface
