(12.4.3b)where the response time, tR is on the order of 1 to 2 h for the cases studied. An exponential approach to equilibrium, such as predicted using the rate equations, would have probably worked as well. Their observations of equilibrium values for strength and depth (.Mseq and Heq respectively) suggest that radiative cooling must be balanced by other processes such as advection or subsidence for these situations.;As described in Chapter I, the lowlevel jet (LLJ) is a thin stream of fast moving air, with maximum wind speeds of 10 to 20 mls usually located 100 to 300 m above the ground. Peak speeds up to 30 mls have been reported, and altitudes of the peak were occasionally as high as 900 m above ground. The LLJ can have a width of hundreds of kilometers and a length of a thousand kilometers, making it more like a sheet than a narrow ribbon, in some cases. The LLJ has been observed in Europe (Sladkovic and Kanter, 1977 Kraus, et aI., 1985 ), Africa (Anderson, 1976 Hart, et aI., 1978), North and South AmeIjca (Blackadar, 1957 Bonner, 1968 Lettau, 1967), and Australia (Malcher and Kraus, 193
