Suggestions for the value of b range from 0.5 to 1.0 (Taylor and Teunissen, 1987 Jackson and Hunt, 1975 and Jensen, et a1., 1984 Zeman and Jensen, 1987), but it appears that 0.5 gives the best agreement with observations. For many of the gentle hills reviewed by Taylor, et a1. (1987), the height above the hill crest where the maximum speedup is found ranges between 2.5 and 5 m. The inner layer for the hill of Fig 14.17, for example, is about 3.5 m thick at point D. Thus, we see that the inner layer is quite shallow. In the outer layer, some of the changes to the turbulence field appear to be described by rapid distortion theory (Taylor, et al., 1987). This theory assumes that existing eddies are distorted by the flow over the hill, and that the turbulence is modified by compression and stretching of the existing vortex elements (Britter, et aI., 1981 Panofsky, et al., 1982). The theory further assumes that the distortion is rapid enough that turbulence generation by the mechanical production terms is not increased.

The theory further assumes that the distortion is rapid enough that turbulence generation by the mechanical production terms is not increased. Rapiddistortion theory predicts that w,2 will increase over a 2D ridge, but u ,2 will decrease in;the outer layer. The vortex stretching also enhances the higher frequencies of turbulence,and reduces the lower frequencies. Observations, however, indicate that both w,2 and u ,2;and reduces the lower frequencies. Observations, however, indicate that both w,2 and u ,2are reduced in the outer layer. In the inner layer, where wmd shears are enhanced and turbulence is in local equilibrium with the surface, most turbulence statistics (including stress) are larger than their upstream values (Taylor, et a1., 1987). Zeman and Jensen (1987) have suggested a third layer in between the inner and outer layers. This layer occurs at roughly the height of maximum speedup, and is characterized by a minimum in turbulent stresses as a consequence of the curvature of the mean flow streamlines. Analogous curvature effects are believed to be related in increases in turbulence statistics upstream of the hill crest. A series of hills can modify the flow to yield a new logwind profile that has an aerodynamic roughness length characteristic of rough terrain (Fig 14.18). Over the first;Fig. 14.18 (a) Flow over a series of hills. (b) Upwind profile A speeds up over first hill B, but eventually reaches a new equilibrium characteristic of a rougher surface C.
