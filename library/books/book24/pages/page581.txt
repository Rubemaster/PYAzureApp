(After Turton and Nicholls, 1987).;Most of the cloudtop entrainment relationships are written as a balance between the production, dissipation, and consumption of TKE (Stage and Businger, 1981). The production mechanisms include surface heating, cloudtop cooling, cloudtop entrainment instability, and wind shear. Consumption is associated with wann entrained air moving down and cold air moving up. The basic premise, as discussed in Section 11.4.3, is that the portion of produced TKE which is not dissipated or transported away can be expended by consumption during the entrainment process. Randall (1984) recognized that entrainment and parcel motion is a very nonlocal process that is best described by Lagrangian or non local turbulence closure approaches. Parameterizations of the Lagrangian concept lead to the Eulerian and process partitioning
