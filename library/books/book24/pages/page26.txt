As the tops of the highest thennals reach greater and greater depths during the course of the day, the highest thennals might reach their lifting condensation level, LCL, if sufficient moisture is present. The resulting fairweather clouds are often targets for soaring birds and glider pilots, who seek the updraft of the thennals. High or middle overcast can reduce the insolation at ground level. This, in turn, reduces the intensity of thennals. On these days the ML may exhibit slower growth, and may even become non turbulent or neutrallystratified if the clouds are thick enough.;About a half hour before sunset the thennals cease to fonn (in the absence of cold air advection), allowing turbulence to decay in the fonnerly wellmixed layer. The resulting layer of air is sometimes called the residual layer because its initial mean state variables and concentration variables are the same as those of the recentlydecayed mixed layer. For example, in the absence of advection, passive tracers dispersed into the daytime mixed layer will remain aloft in the RL during the night. The RL is neutrally stratified, resulting in turbulence that is nearly of equal intensity in all directions. As a result, smoke plumes emitted into the RL tend to disperse at equal rates in the vertical and lateral directions, creating a coneshaped plume. Figure 1.10 shows a sketch of coning.;Fig. 1.10 The static stability decreases with height in the nocturnal boundary layer. gradually blending into the neutrallystratified residual layer aloft, as indicated by the isentropic surfaces sketched on the left. Smoke emissions into the stable air fan out in the horizontal with little vertical dispersion other than wavelike OScillations. Smoke emissions in the neutral residuallayer air spread with an almost equal rate in the vertical and horizontal, allowing the smoke plume to assume a conelike shape.
