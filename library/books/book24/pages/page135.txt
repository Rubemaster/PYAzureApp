 0 (4.3.1f)becauseu t u2  u2u t  (see section 2.9.2). Many of the terms in the above sum were;becauseu t u2  u2u t  (see section 2.9.2). Many of the terms in the above sum werenot written out because the alternating unit tensor forced them to zero. Physically. this means that Coriolis force can not generate turbulent kinetic energy.;Kinetic energy enters the picture because the variance u i ,2 is nothing more than twice theturbulence kinetic energy per unit mass. The Coriolis term merely redistributes energy from one horizontal direction to another. Furthermore. the magnitude of the redistribution;turbulence kinetic energy per unit mass. The Coriolis term merely redistributes energy from one horizontal direction to another. Furthermore. the magnitude of the redistributionterm 2fc u1 u2 is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the other terms in;(4.3.la). For that reason. the Coriolis terms are usually neglected in the turbulence variance and covariance equations. even for the cases where they are not identically zero.;Simplified Velocity Variance Budget Equations. Inserting the simplifications of the previous subsections in equation (4.3.1 a) and rearranging the terms gives;(4.3.1g) III N v VI VII;(4.3.1g) III N v VI VIIrepresents local storage of variance. describes the advection of variance by the mean wind. is a production or loss term. depending on whether the buoyancy flux;represents local storage of variance. describes the advection of variance by the mean wind. is a production or loss term. depending on whether the buoyancy fluxw 9 v  is positive (e.g . daytime over land) or negative (e.g . night;w 9 v  is positive (e.g . daytime over land) or negative (e.g . nightover land).;over land).is a production term. The momentum flux u .u. is usually negative I J in the boundary layer because the momentum of the wind is lost downward to the ground thus. it results in a positive contribution to variance when multiplied by a negative sign.
