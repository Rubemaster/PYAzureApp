Chapter 4 119 Fig 4.1 . All rightside ordinates should be labeled u.2 (m2 I s2 ) . 135 Fig 4.13. Add to caption  u w is positive at the surface because the mean wind was from the east (i.e., U is negative). 135 Second line of 1st eq after Fig 4.13 The tenn with virtual potential temperatures should be multiplied by gravity g . 135 last line of last eq. Insert prime in 3rd tenn (Uil p) ... .;Chapter 5 153 First parag., 2nd word Change to Fig 2.9 157 Fig 5.6. Inside right fig Add the missing t at the end of Turbulent in Turbulent Transport. 158 Fig 5.7 could be enhanced by allowing for shear loss as well as shear production. To do this, extend the ordinate down to negative values. It can also be enhanced to include viscous effects, by drawing a small circle around the origin, within which there is no turbulence. Also see Stull, 1995 Meteorology Today for Scientists and Engineers. West (Wadsworth) Pub!. 355pp. paperback. 167 Fig 5.16. The solid curve in the bottom fig is drawn incorrectly, because Shear Production and Dissipation should have separate lines.;168 Tenn 4 of eq (5.4b), in the denominator of the pressure tenn, change the subscript on x to i.;170 Fig 5.17f should be labeled Unstable. 180 Change 3rd word in Discussion to had. 180 Eq (5.7a). Multiply tenn IV by dUdXj 191 Separate 9a) and 9b) into separate exercises. 9b) has insufficient data for the solution, so assumptions would need to be made. Perhaps it is best not to assign 9b). 191 Remove exercises 8) and 10). They are repeats from earlier chapters. 192 Add to exercise 18) Dont forget to consider nonlocal static stability. 193 Remove exercise 19). Repeated from an earlier chapter. 194 Ex 24), the equation in the first line should be e  (e)32 Il 194 Ex 25). The given fluxes are surface fluxes.;(dUi w Uk I dz) 246 Ex 12f) Change first phrase to be Using the answer from (e), make ... ;Chapter 7 254 Fig 7.3c.
