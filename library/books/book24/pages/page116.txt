Andre, et aI., (1978) have used Day 33 from that experiment as the basis for a numerical simulation of boundary layer evolution. Fig 3.7shows the modeled e evolution and the corresponding verification soundings. Modeled heat fluxes are shown in Fig 3.7c. The nearly uniform potential temperature with height is apparent, as are the linear heat flux prom.es that are a characteristic signature of convective ML turbulence. Modeled and observed humidity profiles are shown in Fig 3.8 for the Wangara experiment. The mean specific humidity decreases slightly with height. This slight slope occurs when dry air is entraining into the top of the ML, while moisture is evaporating into the bottor.. Evolution of the observed wind speeds are shown in Fig 3.9. During the afternoon hours when the mixed layer is over 1000 m thick, the winds within the interior of the ML have approximately constant wind speed with height. In the surface layer the winds must decrease towards zero at the ground. Across the entrainment zone at the top of the ML the winds change to their geostrophic values. For these cases, baroclinicity caused the geostrophic wind speed in the mixed layer to be faster than those higher above the ground. As a result, the wind speed above the ML is less than the winds within the ML, even though the ML winds are subgeostrophic and the FA winds are close to geostrophic.
