GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR TURBULENT FLOW 95and  1 dP V  g f P dX c (3.5.3h);Sometimes the left hand side of equations c thru g are simplified usingdO dO Uj dO  dt at dXj (3.5.3i);dO dO Uj dO  dt at dXj (3.5.3i)where the total derivative d( )dt is inferred to include only mean advective effects, and not the turbulent effects.;Many applications will have to wait until more realistic PBL initial and boundary conditions have been covered. For now, just a few artificial sample exercises showing the use of equations (3.5.3) will be presented. .;Problem 1. Suppose that the turbulent heat flux decreases linearly with heightaccording to w 9  a  b z, where a  0.3 (K ms 1) and b  3x 104 (K sl) . If the initial potential temperature profile is an arbitrary shape (i.e., pick a shape), then what will be the shape of fmal proflle one hour later? Neglect subsidence, radiation, latent heating, and assume horizontal homogeneity.;Solution. Neglecting subsidence, radiation, and latent heating leaves (3.5.30 as;Solution.

This answer is not a function of z hence, air at each height in the sounding warms at the same rate. Integrating over time from t  to to t gives;Plugging in the expression for w 9 gives de!dt  b .
