Fig. 12.5 Idealized models of SBL potential temperature profile. (a) well mixed (b) linearlymixed  (c) linear (d) polynomial (e) exponential.;The wellmixed SBL can also occur in fog or stratocumulus situations, where strong radiative cooling at cloud top creates convective mixing. For this case, buoyancy is a source of turbulence.;MixedLinear. Another idealization allows a potential temperature increase (oftenlinearly) with height, but retains a strong temperature step, eh at the top of the SBL (Fig 12.5b). This can occur with moderately strong winds and turbulence.;Above h it is assumed that e  O. This notsowellmixed layer occurs with slightly weaker mechanical forcings than the previous case.

A third idealization (Estoumel, et aI., 1985) describes a linear increase of potential temperature from a finite value near the surface to zero at the top of the SBL (Fig 12.Sc).
