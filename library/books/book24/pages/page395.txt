SIMILARITYTIIEORY 387where A(zh2 , hzIL) is some universal function to be detennined empirically, and M2 and h2 are velocity and height scales in the outer layer. The flow at the bottom of the mid boundary layer is matched or fitted to agree with that at the top of the surface layer. The resulting relationship relates the surface stress to the mean flow higher in the interior of the boundary layer. When this procedure is also performed for heat and moisture, we arrive at the following set of equations;(9.8a)where A, B, C and D are universal functions, and Km(k KH)  2. Yamada (1976);where A, B, C and D are universal functions, and Km(k KH)  2. Yamada (1976)tested a number of velocity scales, and found that U2  iT, V 2  V worked best. g g The length scale, h2 was best modeled using Zj during the day, and the depth of the turbulent layer at night. With these scales, his analysis of field experiment data yielded the functional forms for A, B and C plotted in Fig 9.10. These equations can be combined and solved to give the bulk transfer (or drag) coefficients, which allow us to find the surface flux given knowledge of mean variables aloft and at the surface
