80 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYhas the potential to release or absorb additional latent heat during any phase changes that might occur. To simplify the equations describing enthalpy conservation, micrometeorologists often utilize the phase change information, E, contained in the moisture conservation equations. Thus, an equation for a can be written;1 aQ. ( OJ pCp  (3.2.5);where va is the thermal diffusivity, and Lp is the latent heat associated with the phasechange of E. The values for latent heat at OOC are Lv  2.50 x 106 Jkg (gasliquid), Lr  3.34 x lOS Jkg (liquidsolid), and Ls  2.83 x 106 Jkg of water (gassolid). Qj is the component of net radiation in the jib direction. The specific heat for moist air at constant pressure, , is approximately related to the specific heat for dry air,   1004.67 J kg KI, by    (l  0.84 q). Given typical magnitudes of q in the boundary layer, it is important not to neglect the moisture contribution to . Terms I, II, and VI are the storage, advection, and molecular diffusion terms, as before. Term vn is the body source term associated with radiation divergence. Term vrn is also a body source term associated with latent heat released during phase changes. These body source terms affect the whole volume, not just the boundaries.;3.2.6 Conservation of a Scalar Quantity;Let C be the concentration (mass per volume) of a scalar such as a tracer in the atmosphere. The conservation of tracer mass requires thatac  U ac v a2c  Sc .. . .... c (3.2.6) 01 J ox. ai J J I II VI VII;ac  U ac v a2c  Sc .. . .... c (3.2.6) 01 J ox. ai J J I II VI VIIwhere Vc is the molecular diffusivity of constituent C. Sc is the body source term for the remaining processes not already in the equation, such as chemical reactions. The physical interpretation of each term is analogous to that of (3.2.4c).
