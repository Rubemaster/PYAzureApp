(After StUll, 1984).;Solution The transilient rate curve indicates that the largest eddies (Le., large values of IZ  zl ) present for this case are of size L. Thus, for z  L and z  L, mixing can not change the temperature because the smaller eddies (less than L) are mixing air of the same temperature. Air of different temperature from the other side of the temperature jump is out of reach of these small eddies. Thus, by inspection we can write the first part of our answer
