Entrainment is unstable if (13.3.1a)where the critical equivalent potential temperature jump across cloud top is (Rogers, et aI., 1985a);1  0.609 rSal  1.609 (T );Negatively buoyant downdrafts formed from the entrained air produce additional TKE that can enhance mixing and entrainment. The newly entrained air can then also become unstable and sink, resulting in even more TKE and more entrainment. This positive feedback process can cause a cloud to entrain large amounts of dry air, resulting in the rapid breakup and evaporation of the cloud. A number of investigators have suggested that (13.3.1a) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for unstable entrainment (Hanson, 1984). Rogers and Telford (1986) learned that some additional trigger or initial disturbance is required to start the whole process. Albrecht, et a1. (1985) pointed out that even if the criteria above are satisfied, the cloud might not break up if the mixture between the entrained and cloudy air is unsaturated.;Although lateral entrainment might be the dominant mixing mechanism for unsaturated thermals, it appears to playa minor role for many of the cumulus clouds studied. Entrainment through the top of the cloud is more important. In this process, entrained air at cloud top partially mixes with some of the cloudy air, and the mixture cools because of the evaporation of some of the cloud droplets, just like stratocumulus cloudtop entrainment instability. The result is a negatively buoyant downdraft (see Fig 13.8) that sinks through the cloud and mixes with other cloudy air along the way (Pontikis, et aI., 1987). Although Squires (1958) had originally proposed this mechanism, it wasnt until the mixing analysis by Paluch (1979) that the cloud top entrainment mechanism was confirmed and better understood. Her analysis, modified here using the techniques of Betts (1985), uses conserved variables to diagnose the origins of air measured at various levels within a cloud.
