Another way to look at the effects of subsidence is to recognize that the associated divergence, Div, is removing some of the chilled air from the SBL. Using L9 .. HM as a measure of the accumulated cold air within the SBL, the effective bulk heat flux into the whole SBL, Qw that would cause heating equal to the amount of cold air lost is;Q  DivL9 H W s 69 (12.2.4b);Typical magnitudes of this flux are 0.01 K mls. It is possible to have BL cooling and SBL formation in regions of convergence, where warm air advection over a colder surface can provide the cooling in the absence of radiative cooling. Convergence sweeps together the surrounding cold air to make a deeper andor colder SBL than would have otherwise occurred via local processes. The equations (12.2.4a  b) can be used, recognizing that Div is negative and w is positive.;Advection. Often the largest term in the heat budget of the SBL is advection, yet it is the one least often considered or measured. Schaller and Wichmann (1985) and Carlson and Stull (1986) have demonstrated that advective heating rates can easily range between  2 Kh, where the heating rate is given by;Advection.
