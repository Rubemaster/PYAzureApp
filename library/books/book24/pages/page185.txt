In a statically stable environment, turbulent venical motions are acting against the restoring force of gravity. Thus, buoyancy tends to suppress turbulence, while wind shears tend to generate turbulence mechanically. The buoyant production term (Term 1lI) of the TKE budget equation (5.1 b) is negative in this situation, while the mechanical production term (Term IV) is positive. Although the other terms in the TKE budget are cenainly imponant, a simplified but nevenheless useful approximation to the physics is possible by examining the ratio of Term III to Term IV. This ratio, called the flux Richardson number, Re, is given by;Re  y au. (5.6.1 a) (u.u.) ...!. I J dx. J where the negative sign on Term IV is dropped by convention. The Richardson number is dimensionless. The denominator consists of 9 terms, as implied by the summation notation. If we assume horizontal homogeneity and neglect subsidence, then the ahove equation reduces to the more common form of the flux Richardson number (J (w9 v ) Rr  ....,. () au () av uw Tz vw az;For statically unstable flows, Rr is usually negative (remember that the denominator is usually negative). For neutral flows, it is zero. For statically stable flows, Rr is positive. Richardson proposed that Rr   I is a critical value, because the mechanical production rate balances the buoyant consumption of TKE. At any value of Rr less than  1, static stability is insufficiently strong to prevent the mechanical generation of turbulence. For negative values of Rr the numerator even contributes to the generation of turbulence. Therefore, he expected that Row IS turbulent (dynamically unstable) when Rf  1 Row BECOMES laminar (dynamically stable) when Rf  1 We recognize that statically unstable flow is, by definition, always dynamically unstable.
