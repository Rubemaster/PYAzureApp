For this case of strong turbulence, the linear and exponential models are not significantly different. However, all three models give different SBL heights h  133 m for the wellmixed model, h  266 m for the linear model, and h  398 to 531 m for the exponential model. In spite of the fact that h is poorly defined (and probably should not be used), the bulk depth scale, H9 is well defined for all profile shapes.
