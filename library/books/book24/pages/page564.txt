(After Nicholls and Leighton, 1986).;If fine resolution modeling of the flux divergence is required, a parameterization such as proposed by Hanson and Derr (1987) and Hanson (1987) could be used. Otherwise, a simpler approach allows all of the flux divergence to occur across a small fixed distance such as 30 m. Rogers, et a!. (1985a) modeled the change in net longwave flux across the top (AI T) and bottom (AI B) of the cloud as;A 1. crSB (T 4 T 4 ) UiT  P c, cloud top  sky (13.2.2a);M. crSB (T 4  T 4 ) B P Cp surface cloud base (13.2.2b);M. crSB (T 4  T 4 ) B P Cp surface cloud base (13.2.2b)where (1  Ii  Ii) is the net longwave radiation, positive upward.;13.3.1 Cloudtop Entrainment Instability in Stratocumulus;Lilly (1968) first suggested that the warm air entrained into the top of a stratocumulus cloud might cool and sink if it were initially dry enough to support considerable evaporative cooling of the neighboring cloud droplets. His criterion for this unstableentrainment state was AEZ8e  0, for AEZ8e  8e just above cloud top  8e just below cloud top Randall (1980) and Deardorff (1980) recognized that the virtual potential temperature was a better measure of buoyancy and instability. and suggested a minor modification to Lillys criterion
