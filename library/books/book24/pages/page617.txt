These plumes are as wide as the city, and can be transported hundreds of kilometers downstream (Fig 14.21). In the absence of wind, closed circulations analogous to the seabreeze can form over the city (Fig 14.23).;The portion of boundary layer between the roof tops and the ground is known as the urban canopy layer, by analogy with plant canopies.(Oke, 1987). Within this region we find the urban canyons, ducting and trapping of air flow, and multiple reflections of radiation previously discussed. Above that is the turbulent wake layer, where the wakes and IBLs from the individual buildings and surface patterns can still be discerned (Fig 14.24). Still higher is the surface layer, where the momentum and heat budgets feel the average effect of the urban area, but where individual wakes are not important. Finally, the urban mixed layer extends to the top of the urban boundary layer, which itself might be an internal boundary layer within the largerscale flow.;Fig. 14.24 Layers within the urban boundary layer. (After Oke. 1987).
