Our fundamental understanding of the boundary layer comes from measurements. Most measurements are made in the field, some are made in laboratory tank or wind tunnel simulations, and some are samples from numerical simulations. Theories and parameterizations, such as presented in earlier chapters, are valuable only if they describe the observed boundary layer behavior. In this chapter we will outline the measurement categories, systems, field experiments, and techniques that are available to acquire a variety boundary layer data. Details of instrument design and operation will not be covered here, but they can be found in other references (see review by Lenschow, 1986).;To make boundary layer measurements, we need three components (1) a detector or sensor, (2) an encoder or digitizer, and (3) a data logger. Most detectors are devices for which the physical characteristics (size, resistance, etc) change as a function of the variable being measured. Thus, virtually all detectors are analog in nature, providing a continuously varying output as a function of continuously varying meteorological conditions. This output signal must then be sampled to produce a discrete digital record, using some sort of encoder or analogtodigital converter. The resulting discrete series of data must be recorded, often on magnetic tape, magnetic disks, or optical disks. Instrument system or instrument package is the name given to the set of all three components listed above. Additional components are also required (4) an instrument platform, (5) a means of calibration, and (6) display devices. Platforms such as a tower or aircraft are
