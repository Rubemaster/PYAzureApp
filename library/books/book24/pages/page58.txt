This turbulence is produced in primarily the u,2 and v,2 components. Daysof both strong winds and strong heating will have both sources of turbulence. For night, Fig 2.9c shows how the static stability suppresses the TKE, causing it to decrease rapidly with height. Turbulence is produced primarily near the ground by wind shears, although the enhanced shears near the nocturnal jet can also generate turbulence. Not apparent in this figure is the observation that nocturnal turbulence is sometimes sporadic happening in turbulent bursts followed by quiescent periods.;Flux is the transfer of a quantity per unit area per unit time. In BL meteorology, we are often concerned with mass, heat, moisture, momentum and pollutant fluxes. The dimensions of these fluxes are summarized below, using SI units as the example
