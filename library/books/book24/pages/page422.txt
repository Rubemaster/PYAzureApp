(h) Radiosonde.;The classical white louvered instrument shelter, called the Stevenson screen, is mounted on a stand to place the instruments inside at a height of about 2 m above the local ground level. The shelter protects the instruments from the sun, but it also filters out much of the smaller scale turbulence. As a result, we can expect to measure mean quantities such as temperature, humidity, and pressure within the shelter. Otherwise, this platform is not used very often for micrometeorological measurements.;A mast is a pole upon which instruments can be placed at a variety of heights. Sometimes scaffolding is used to erect a short tower. A typical mast height is 10 m to 50 m. It is relatively inexpensive, and can be erected with simple equipment. Because of its limited height, it is primarily useful for surface layer measurements. Sensors are often placed closer together at the bottom of the mast than at the top, because profiles of temperature, wind, and humidity vary approximately logarithmically with height. For example, at the Minnesota experiment (see Table 101), temperature sensors were placed at z  0.5, 1,2,4,8, 16, and 32 m. Such masts can be easily transported and erected for a field program, and then dismantled when the experiment ends. Wires carry the signals down the mast to a data logger or data trailer close by.
