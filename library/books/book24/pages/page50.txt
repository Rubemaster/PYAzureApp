Often we need to find the average of a derivative of a dependent variable. For example, let A be dependent on both t and s, where s is an independent variable such as x, y, or z. In this case, we must use Leibniz theorem;(2.4.2f) where Sl and S2 are the limits of integration. For the special case where Sl and S2 are constant with time, we can simply interchange the order of integration and differentiation;Multiplying both sides by liS gives, where S  S2  Sl Sr (2.4.2g);This special case is not always valid for variable depth boundary layers. Suppose we wish to find the timerateofchange of a BLaveraged mixing ratio, r, where the BL average is defined by integrating over the depth of the BL i.e., from zO to zZj Since Zj varies with time, we can use the full Leibniz theorem to give;This special case is not always valid for variable depth boundary layers. Suppose we wish to find the timerateofchange of a BLaveraged mixing ratio, r, where the BL average is defined by integrating over the depth of the BL i.e., from zO to zZj Since Zj varies with time, we can use the full Leibniz theorem to gived  S   S  ar d z. z. r    1 dt 1  Zj at  r(t, Zj)Tt (2.4.2h);d  S   S  ar d z. z. r    1 dt 1  Zj at  r(t, Zj)Tt (2.4.2h)where Zj  represents a location just above the top of the BL. Finally, lets reexamine the spectral gap. If our averaging time is 30 minutes to I hour, turbulent fluctuations will be eliminated, leaving the longerperiod time variations. As we saw in Fig 2. J, the 30minute mean wind speed changes over the period of a few hours. Thus, we can take the 30minute average of the timederivative of variable A to find how A varies over longer periods
