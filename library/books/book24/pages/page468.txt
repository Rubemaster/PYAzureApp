Transilient Models. Fiedler (1984) demonstrated that the TDBU model can be considered to be a special case of the nonlocal transilient closure model. Since the transilient approach explicitly models eddies mixing across finite distances, it can easily model the mixing associated with thermals rising in the ML. Local gradients are not used. Instead, differences between moving parcels and the surrounding environment determine the amount and direction of mixing. Fig 11.15 shows a simulation of ML evolution observed near the Cabauw tower (Stull and Driedonks, 1987). The subset of grid points that were turbulent in this 1D transilient model are shaded in the figure, and indicate the whole turbulent domain including the entrainment zone. Other measures of ML depth, namely the height at which a parcel rising from the surface would first become neutrally buoyant, and the height of most negative heat flux, are both indicated. The four phases of ML evolution are evident in this figure.;Comparison of transilient modeled and observed boundary layer depth for Cabauw, during 0600 UTC 31 May to 0600 UTC 1 June, 1978. (After Stull and Driedonks, 1987).;Transilient simulations of the evolution of potential temperature and heat flux during the daytime hours of the same case as the previous figure.
