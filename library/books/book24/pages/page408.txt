In each city block ( 0.1 km by 0.2 km ), there are 20 houses, where each house has nearly a square foundation (10 m on a side) and has an average height of 5 m. Calculate the value of the surface stress acting on this neighborhood when a wind speed of 10 rns is measured at a height of 20 m above ground in statically neutral conditions. Express the stress in Pascals.
