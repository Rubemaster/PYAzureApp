Range from lidar (km)lidar images of the aerosolladen boundary layer, obtained during the FIFE field experiment in Kansas. (a) Convective mixed layer observed at 1030 local time on 1 July 1987, when winds were generally less than 2 mls. (b) Slightlystable boundary layer with sheargenerated turbulence, observed at 530 local time on 7 July 1987. Winds ranged from 5 mls near the surface to 15 mls near the top of the boundary layer.
