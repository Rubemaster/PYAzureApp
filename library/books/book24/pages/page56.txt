Problem. Suppose that we erect a short mast instrumented with anemometers to measure the U and W wind components. We record the instantaneous wind speeds every 6 s for a minute, resulting in the following 10 pairs of wind observations;Find the mean, biased variance, and standard deviation for each wind component. Also, find the covariance and correlation coefficient between U and W.;1 Ow  1.18 msuw  1.10 m2s2 ruw  0.85 (dimensionless);Discussion. Thus, the turbulent variations of W are more intense than those of U, even though the mean wind speed for W is zero in this example. U and W tend to vary in opposite directions on the average, as indicated by the negative values for the covariance and the correlation coefficient. The magnitude of the correlation coefficient is fairly high (close to one), meaning that there are just a few observations where U and W vary in the same direction, but many more observations where they yary oppositely.;The usual definition of kinetic energy (KE) is KE  0.5 m M2, where m is mass.

When dealing with a fluid such as air it is more convenient to talk about kinetic energy perunit mass, which is just 0.5 M2. It is enticing to partition the kinetic energy of the flow into a portion associated with the mean wind (MKE), and a portion associated with the turbulence (TKE). By taking advantage of the mean and turbulent parts of velocity introduced in section 2.3, we can immediately write the desired equations;unit mass, which is just 0.5 M2.
