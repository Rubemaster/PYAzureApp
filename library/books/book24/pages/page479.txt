MIXED LAYER 471uniformly mixed in the vertical regardless of their source altitude, as expected in a well mixed layer (Nieuwstadt and van Dop, 1982). This timeaveraged statistical behavior should not be confused with the instantaneous looping of smoke plumes (Fig 11.26c). Such dispersion within MLs has been observed during the Condors field program (Kaimal, et aI., 1986). It has also been simulated with LES models (Deardorff, 1972 Lamb, 1978), and parameterized using asymmetric matrices in transilient turbulence theory (Stull, 1988). As mentioned before, pollutants transported up from the surface by thermals are trapped beneath the capping inversion. Certain types of cumulus clouds (see Chapter 13) can break through the stable entrainment zone to vent pollutants and moisture out of the boundary layer into the free aunosphere.;Problem 1 Given a cloudfree ML with constant we  0.1 mis, and a constant divergence of Div  5 x 10.5 SI, find the ML depth versus time. The initial conditions are   0 at t  to  O.;Solution We can integrate the continuity equation from the surface up to zi to find the subsidence velocity at the ML topw I   Div  z. L z I (11.2.7a);When this is used in (1 1.2.2a), we get the prognostic equation
