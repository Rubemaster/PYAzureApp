Each of these tenns is now dimensionless. The last tenn, a dimensionless dissipation rate, will not be pursued funher here. The von Karman constant, k, is a dimensionless number included by tradition. Its importance in the log wind profile in the surface layer is discussed in the next section. Investigators have yet to pin down its precise value, although preliminary experiments suggest that it is between about 0.35 and 0.42. We will use a value of 0.4 in most of this book, although some of the figures adopted from the literature are based on kO.3S. Tenn III is usually assigned the symbol, ,and is further defined as  zL, where L is the Obukhov length. Thus,
