304 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOOYor spectral domain). This process is also known as Fourier decomposition. The flrst equation performs the inverse transform, converting from frequencies back into physical space.;Perform a forward Fourier transform to flnd the 8 coefflcients, Fq(n). To check your results, perform an inverse transform to conflrm that the origin time series is recreated. Remember that the Fq(n) coefflcients are complex, each having a real and an imaginary part Fq(n)  Freal(n)  i Fimag(n) .;. Solution N  8 and 6t  15 min. Thus, the total period is P  N6t  2 h. Equation (8.4.1b) must be used to find Fq(n). For those computer languages that accept complex numbers, (8.4.1b) can be programmed directly, where each of the A(k) data points has a real part equal to the value listed in the table, and an imaginary part of zero. For hand calculation, we can use Eulers formula to translate (8.4.1b) back into sines and cosines;As an example. for n  O. all of the cosines of zero are unity and all of the sines are zero. This leaves;As an example. for n  O. all of the cosines of zero are unity and all of the sines are zero. This leaveswhich is just the mean of A. For our case Fq(O)  7.0  0.0 i . For n  1 we cant make such a simpliflcation. so we are forced to sum over all k for both the real and imaginary parts. This gives us Fq (1)  0.28  1.03 i. Continuing this procedure for all other n yields;which is just the mean of A. For our case Fq(O)  7.0  0.0 i . For n  1 we cant make such a simpliflcation. so we are forced to sum over all k for both the real and imaginary parts. This gives us Fq (1)  0.28  1.03 i.
