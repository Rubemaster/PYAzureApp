tP. When P is small, we will find one value for U, and when P is larger, we mightfind a different value. In fact, U (P) is probably a smoothly varying function of P. Given the instantaneous measurements of U(t) shown in the table below a) Plot U vs t.;find a different value. In fact, U (P) is probably a smoothly varying function of P. Given the instantaneous measurements of U(t) shown in the table below a) Plot U vs t.b) Plot U vs P for P  0 to 60 min. (A calculator or computer might make the job easier.) c) Comment on the relationship between the spectral gap and your answer from part (b).
