Solid lines correspond to the equations, while the shaded region indicates the range of values observed in the data. After Businger, et al. (1971).;We can simplify term IV of the dimensionless TKE equation (5.7a) by choosing a coordinate system aligned with the mean wind, assuming horizontal homogeneity,neglecting subsidence, and using the definition that u.2  (u w )s;neglecting subsidence, and using the definition that u.2  (u w )skz au Term IV   u. az;Based on this dimensionless term, we can define a dimensionless wind shear, GM, bykz au  M u. az (5.8a);This parameter is primarily useful for studies of surfacelayer wind profiles and momentum fluxes. In chapter 9 we will use M in similarity theory to estimate momentum flux (as given by u) from the local mean wind shear. This is particularly valuable;This parameter is primarily useful for studies of surfacelayer wind profiles and momentum fluxes. In chapter 9 we will use M in similarity theory to estimate momentum flux (as given by u) from the local mean wind shear. This is particularly valuablebecause it is easy to measure mean wind speeds at a variety of heights in the surface layer,
