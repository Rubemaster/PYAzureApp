Because one of the primary avenues for studying turbulent flow is the stochastic approach, it is desirable to have a good working knowledge of statistics. This section will survey some of the basic methods of statistics, including the mean, variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation. Those readers having an adequate background on statistics might wish to skim this section.;2.4.1 The Mean t s e Time ( ), space ( ), and ensemble ( ) averages are three ways to define a mean. The time average applies at one specific point in space, and consists of a sum or integral over time period P. For any variable, A(t, s), that is a function of time, t, and space, s;NI t I  .

The spatial average, which applies at some instant in time, is given by a sum or integral over spatial domain S;N I s sA (t)  L A(t,j)j  0 or sA (t) t J A(t,s) ds (2.4.1 b);NIe 1  A(t,s)  N ..J Ai (t,s);e 1  A(t,s)  N ..J Ai (t,s)i  0 (2.4.lc);In the equations above, t1t  PIN and t1s  SIN, where N is the number of data points. For laboratory experiments, the ensemble average is the most desirable, because it allows us to reduce random experimental errors by repeating the basic experiment. Unlike laboratory experiments, however, we have little control over the atmosphere, so we are rarely able to observe reproducible weather events. We are therefore unable to use the ensemble average. Spatial averages are possible by deploying an array of meteorological sensors covering a line, area, or volume. If the turbulence is homogeneous (statistically the same at every point in space, see Fig 2.4) then each of the sensors in the array will be measuring
