A kinematic fluxsuch as we is nothing more than a statistical covariance. We will usually leave out the word kinematic in future references to such fluxes. As before, we can extend our arguments to write various kinds of eddy flux;Vertical kinematic eddy heat flux we (2.7.1a);Vertical kinematic eddy moisture flux wq (2.7.1b);Vertical kinematic eddy moisture flux wq (2.7.1b)xdirection kinematic eddy heat flux ue (2.7.1c);Vertical kinematic eddy flux of Vmomentum  uw (2.7.1d)
