The development of higherorder closure (usually meaning anything higher than frrstorder closure) was closely tied to the evolution of digital computer power. Although the use of highermoment equations for turbulence forecasting was suggested in the early 1940s, the large number of unknown variables remained a stumbling block. Then, around 1950, Rotta and Chou and .others suggested parameterizations for some of the unknowns. By the late 1960s, computer power improved to the point whre second order closure forecasts for clear air turbulence and shear flows were first made. In the early 1970s, the United States Environmental Protection Agency began funding some secondorder closure pollution dispersion models, and by the mid 1970s a number of investigators were using such models. In fact, secondorder closure appears to have started before oneandahalforder closure. In the late 1970s, some thirdorder closure models also started to appear in the literature, with many more thirdorder simulations published in the 1980s. The set of secondorder turbulence equations includes not only those from oneanda halforder, but it includes second moment terms as well (Wichmann and Schaller, 1986). Using the same idealized example as above, consider a dry environment, horizontally homogeneous, with no subsidence. The additional governing prognostic equations are;(4.4.1b) for uju, and (4.4.3c) for we. The resulting set of coupled equations is;(4.4.1b) for uju, and (4.4.3c) for we.
