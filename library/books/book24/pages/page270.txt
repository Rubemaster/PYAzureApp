 O. C ) iL 0.1 GI;Fig. 7.6 Idealized Madison radiation budget for example 7.3.3.;Discussion The radiation terms in this equation are plotted in Fig 7.6 for the 24 hour period. As expected, there is net heating during the day and cooling at night. Heating starts almost an hour after sunrise, and ends roughly an hour before sunset.;bouom are the values just above and below the boundary. It can also be thought of as aconductivity, because a given sdifference (voltage potential) yields a greater flux (current) if the conductivity is greater. The transport velocity is usually parameterized as a function of some measure of turbulence appropriate to the type of interface;CDM at zO (7.4b) and at z  Zj (7.4c)
