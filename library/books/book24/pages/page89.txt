To a close approximation, air in the atmosphere behaves like a Newtonian fluid. Thus, the expression for viscous stress from section 2.9.3 allows us to write term VI as;(I) a aUi au.

Substituting this back into (3.2.3a) gives the form for the momentum equation that is most often used as a starting point for turbulence derivations
