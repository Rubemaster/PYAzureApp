CLOUDS 557realistic for the midlatitude marine stratocumulus studied by Nicholls and Leighton (1986), but less realistic for the arctic stratus clouds studied by Curry (1986). Typical liquid water paths vary between about 10 and 1000 gm2. Fravalo, et aI. (1981) find that the flux profiles are particularly sensitive to the liquid water content distribution. The bulk cloud albedo, ac and absorption, bc are used to find the net shortwave fluxes at the top and bottom of the cloud (KT and KB respectively, positive for upward flux)  (1  ac) KJ..;K  (1  ac  bc) KJ.. (13.2.1d);The second equation above describes the transmission of downward solar radiationthrough the cloud. The downward solar flux at the top of the cloud deck, KJ.., is always negative, and can be found from (7.3.1b). The albedo and absorption are a function of the liquid water path and the solar zenith angle, as shown in Fig 13.6 (Stephens, 1978). Stephens also presents a parameterization for these curves. One must be careful using either the figures or the parameterization to ensure that the sum of the albedo and absorption do not exceed one (a problem for large liquid water paths and small zenith angles).;100 0.2 20 40 60 80 100 20 40 60 80 Solar zenith angle (degrees) Solar zenith angle (degrees) 13.6 The variability of (a) cloud albedo and (b) shortwave absorption as determined by a theoretical model for changes of solar incidence and liquid water path (W pl. The surface albedo is zero and a tropical moisture profile is assumed. The contours are the fraction of the incident downward fiux at the cloudtop reflected or absorbed. (After Stephens, 1978).;Fig 13.7 shows an example of the long wave radiative flux profile through a stratocumulus deck, and the associated heating rate. Water droplets are such efficient absorbersemitters of IR radiation that the cloud essentially behaves as a black body. The changes in radiative flux associated with the cloud occur with an efolding length of only about 30 m, causing a sharp cooling spike at cloud top and heating spike at cloud base.
