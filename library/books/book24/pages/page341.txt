n, then coherence and phase spectra (described next) are not significant (Le., unreliable)forthatfuency. The coherence spectrum, Coh, is defined by;This is essentially a nonnalized amplitude, and is a real number in the range 0 to 1. It acts very much like a frequency dependent correlation coefficient. Note that in some of the literature Coh2 is defined as the coherence, rather than Coho Like the amplitude spectrum, it is not a function of phase shift. Finally, a phase spectrum, 1, can be defined as;This is essentially a nonnalized amplitude, and is a real number in the range 0 to 1. It acts very much like a frequency dependent correlation coefficient. Note that in some of the literature Coh2 is defined as the coherence, rather than Coho Like the amplitude spectrum, it is not a function of phase shift. Finally, a phase spectrum, 1, can be defined astan 1  Q  Co (8.8.2g);This can be interpreted as the phase difference between the two time series A and B that yielded the greatest correlation for any frequency, n. The phase spectrum can be used to infer the nature of the physical flow. For buoyancy waves, 9 is characteristically 900 out of phase with w while for turbulence, the two variables either in phase or 1800 out of phase.;Problem Given the time series from section 8.4.2 for humidity, and the time series below for vertical velocity, w
