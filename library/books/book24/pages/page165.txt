Little is known about this tenn. When averaged over a horizontal area larger than about 10 Ian by 10 km, it is often assumed that there is little horizontal variation in TKE, thereby making the advection tenn negligible. This is probably a good assumption over most land surfaces. On a smaller scale, however, it is clear that this tenn must be important. For example, picture a reservoir of water cooler than the surrounding land. The lack of heating over the reservoir would allow turbulence to decay in the overlying air, while air over the adjacent land surfaces could be in a state of active convection. A mean wind advecting air across the shores of this reservoir would thus cause significant change in the TKE budget. Over ocean surfaces, the advection tenn would probably be negligible even on the small scales.;Production.
