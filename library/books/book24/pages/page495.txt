(After Vachalek, et aI., 1988).;We learned in this chapter that the ML has a welldefined top, and is usually in quasi eqUilibrium with the surface forcings. These factors allowed us to describe relatively simple models for ML characteristics and evolution. In the next chapter, however, we will learn that the stable boundary layer has a poorlydefined top, and is rarely in equilibrium with the surface. As a result, Chapter 12 reviews other techniques that can be used to describe the stable boundary layer. Clouds, which can be a part of either stable or convective boundary layers, are described in Chapter 13.;Agee, E.M., 1984 Observations from space and thermal convection a historical perspective.
