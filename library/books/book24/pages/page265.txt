256 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOOYwater. Also. the heat capacity (p Cv) of water is about 4000 times larger than that of air. meaning that a lot of heat can be absorbed into water with little temperature change. Thus. the diurnal cycle of radiation is almost completely balanced by a corresponding diurnal variation of energy transport into the sea (Fig 7.3d). In addition. the nearly constant sea surface temperature with time results in a nearly constant heat and moisture flux. and associated slow temporal changes in air temperature and humidity.;Q  Ki  K.1.

IR) radiation emitted up;1.1.  long wave diffusive IR radiation down;The downward fluxes are negative by definition. and upward are positive. Each of these terms represents the sum of direct and diffuse radiation components crossing a locally horizontal plane such as the surface. Fig 7.5 shows a typical diurnal cycle for these radiation components in clear skies at a land surface. Although this equation was written here in kinematic flux form where each term has units of Kms1 it could also have been written in energy flux form.;Fig. 7.5 Surface radiation budget components for 30 July 1971. at Matador.
