The boundary layer in high pressure regions over land consists of three major parts a very turbulent mixed layer a lessturbulent residual layer containing former mixedlayer air and a nocturnal stable boundary layer of sporadic turbulence. The mixed layer can be subdivided into a cloud layer and a subcloud layer. Time markers indicated by SlSS will be used in Fig. 1.12.
