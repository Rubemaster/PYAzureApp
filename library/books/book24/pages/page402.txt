394 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYanalysis gives 1tl  f Su(f)  (Zj  )2f3, 1t2  f Zj ID, and 1t3  Z  Zj. These are plotted in Fig 9.14 for the u, v, and w components of the onedimensional spectra (Kaimal, et aI., 1976). Notice that the peak in these curves corresponds to a wavelength approximately equal to the ML depth. This connrms our earlier statement that the most energetic eddies are the large ones that are produced on the scale of the boundary layer. In situations such as flow over complex terrain, new length scales might be introduced into the flow based on the scales of the terrain irregularities (panofsky, et aI., 1982).;In different parts of the boundary layer, we typically nnd that the nature of the flow is dependent on some scaling parameters, and not dependent on others. For example, in the surface layer we expect turbulence and mean proflles to be related to zL, but in the ML we nnd that zZj is more appropriate than zL. To help organize or knowledge about the relevant scaling parameters, Fig 9.15 relates parameters to identifiable parts of the unstable BL, while Fig 9.16 does the same for the stable BL. In Fig 9.1Sa, the regions that are independent of L or Zj are indicated. In Fig 9.15b, the regions are listed along with the variables that are relevant for each region. We fmd;Fig. 9.15 Schematic diagrams show idealized limits of validity of various scaling techniques for the unstable boundary layer.
