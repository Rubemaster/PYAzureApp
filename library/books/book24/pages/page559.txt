CLOUDS 553by assuming that all the potential energy is convened into kinetic energy (Rogers, et aI., 1985)  (2.CAPE) 12 (13.1.5b);This scale can be used to model the overshoot of the cloJd top above the LOC. The evaporative available potential energy (EAPE) can be defined similarly as (13.1.5a), except for the negative buoyancy associated with the evaporation of liquid water within a sinking cloudy parcel (Betts, 1985). This can be used to study cloudtop entrainment.;Problem Assume that the following measurements of (p, sL rT) were obtained in a cloud and the surrounding environment, respectively (80 kPa, 304.1 kJkg, 16.5 glkg)cloud and (80 kPa, 307.0 kJlkg, 10 g!kg)env Is the cloudy parcel positively or negatively buoyant?;  T In(pJp) 1  0.61r  rL  (13.1.6b);  T In(pJp) 1  0.61r  rL  (13.1.6b)where the overbar represents an average over the layer between Po and p. Since we have no information about the temperature between those two levels, we will use the local value of T and rT at P for simplicity. We will assume a reference level of z  0 at Po  100 kPa. Environment In the unsaturated environment, rL  0 and r  rT Thus;Combining this with the previous equation givesgz (13.1.6d)
