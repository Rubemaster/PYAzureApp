Although there were no latent heating effects during this time period, advection might be important. There were insufficient measurements to calculate the advective contributions to temperature change on this night. Instead, it is left as an exercise for the reader to back out the advective contribution, given the data in Fig 3.10. Andre, et al. (1978) made a similar analysis of the relative importance of teons in the heat budget equation. Fig 3.11 shows that radiation played a much larger role for the Wangara SBL just after sunset, but that turbulence just above the ground increased in importance later in the night. Wind speeds (Fig 3.12) observed at night in the Wangara field experiment showed the characteristic nocturnal jet with peak wind speed of about 14 ms at 200 m above the ground. The simulated profiles shown in the same figure demonstrate the difficulty of forecasting winds at night. Nevertheless, the simulated wind profiles are useful in studying the relative importance of teons in the momentum budget equations (3.5.3 c and d). For this particular case, Fig 3.13 shows that the Coriolis teons were much more important in causing accelerations than were the turbulence effects.
