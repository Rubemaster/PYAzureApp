58 BOUNDARY LAYER METEOROLOGYhas two subscripts, while the unit vector is a vector and always has just one subscript. Three fundamental rules apply within summation notation two concern repeated indices within anyone term, and the other concerns nonrepeated (free) indices.;Rule (b) Whenever one index appears unsummed (free) in a term, then that same index must appear unsummed in all terms in that equation. Hence, that equation effectively represents 3 equations for each value of the un summed index. This insures that all terms are tensorally consistent with the other terms in the equation.
