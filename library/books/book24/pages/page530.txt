The scenario of Fig 12.17 a corresponds to a late afternoon situation where the ground has been wanned by the sun, and where the temperature decreases adiabatically with height within a deep ML. In any plane at constant height above sea level, the higher terrain in the west causes the temperature there to be wanner than the temperature in the east. This creates the horizontal temperature gradient of the previous example, and causes negative geostrophic wind gradients at all heights within the ML (indicated by the thermal wind vectors labeled T.W. in Fig 12.17a).;At night, the ground cools the adjacent air, but not the air higher in the residual layer. This reverses the thermal wind at low altitudes in the SBL, but leaves the thermal wind unchanged higher in the residual layer (Fig 12.17c). The resulting geostrophic wind has a peak at low levels (Fig 12. 17d), assuming a southerly surface geostrophic wind. The actual wind has an even more predominant jet, resulting from drag at the surface (Fig 12.17d).
