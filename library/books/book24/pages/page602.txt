( z02 ) aIBL  0.75  0.03 In z (14.2.1 b);Fig 14.9 shows the idealized evolution of the staticallyneutral logarithmic wind profile as a function of fetch, for the case of flow from a smooth to a rough surface. At fetch xl (see Fig 14.8) only a shallow layer feels the increased roughness. At greater distances, deeper layers feel the increased roughness. Above the top of the IBL (i.e., above the kink in the lines), the wind maintains a profile characteristic of the upwind roughness (Beljaars, 1987).;SmedmanHogstrom and Hogstrom (1978) and Rao, et al. (1974) have shown that real wind profiles often exhibit a transition zone between the equilibrium IBL and the PBL aloft (Fig 14.10a). Also, Claussen (1987) suggests that the change in roughness can be felt a small distance (x  300 zo) upstream of the boundary, resulting in a modification of the upwind profile (Fig 14.lOb). Flow near the ground is slightly reduced for a change from smooth to rough, and flow aloft accelerates slightly. In many parts of the world, there is a patchwork of surface features such as towns, farms, forests, lakes, etc. As sketched in Fig 14.11, this leads to IBLs within IBLs, with many kinks in the logwind profile (Oke, 1978). When we combine kinks due to IBLs with curvature of the wind profile in diabatic conditions and curvature associated with a nonzero displacement distance, we find a very complicated wind profile. When hills are also considered, the result is complex indeed (Beljaars, et al., 1987).
