. Fig l3.9 shows an idealized conserved variable plot of an environmental sounding. Measurements within clouds, plotted as the data points in Fig 13.9, lie on, or close to, a straight line connecting a point on the environmental sounding corresponding to cloud base or subcloud layer air, and another point on the environmental sounding at the height of cloud top. The fact that most of the measurements fall on the same straight mixing line indicates that air originating from cloud base and cloud top are mixed together in various proportions and left within the cloud.;If environmental air from other levels between cloud base and cloud top were entrained into the cloud, then data points would lie between the environmental line and the mixing line drawn in Fig 13.9. Since few such data points are usually observed, we must conclude that most of the air within the cloud came from cloud base and cloud top (Blyth
