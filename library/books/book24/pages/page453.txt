After Wilczak. 1984).;Idealized horizontal and vertical circulation patterns, ensemble averaged over many ramp structures, are sketched in Fig 11.4. High perturbation pressures at the surface below the downdraft regions are associated with divergent horizontal circulations, while beneath the plume updraft there is convergence and a surface low.;Fig. 11.5 Smoothed average vertical cross sections ot (a) rta Sl  (b) wu. and (c) wT(u.a1L) based on a composite ot many plumes.
