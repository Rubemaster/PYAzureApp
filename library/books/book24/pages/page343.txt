Also listed is a subtable with co and quad spectral components of Gwq, the resulting values of Am, Coh2, and the phase angles in degrees. These are plotted in Fig 8.12. Finally, the simple spectrum of the wq time series is listed.;Discussion The biased variances of the wand q time series are 2.0 and 5.0, respectively. From Table 82, we see that the sum of the Gw and Gq spectral components equals their respective variances. This is always a good check to do with the analysis.

Also, the covariance w q ,  3.0, which agrees with the sum of the Cocospectral components. Looking at the original time series, we see that w is usually positive when q is negative, as confIrmed by the negative covariance. Thus, we anticipate that w and q are 1800 out of phase. The phase spectrum supports this. In fact, the only phase values which are substantially different from 1800 are those for which the amplitude (Am) values are small, suggesting that these phase values cant be trusted.
