Willis, 1985). In the bottom 23 of the ML (Fig 11.20b) there is a predominance of cool downdrafts. At the top of the ML, however, we see a peak associated with cool updrafts (Fig 11.2Oc). In fact, there is a broad peak associated with both updrafts and downdrafts that are cool. These are the tops of thermals overshooting into the entrainment zone and then sinking back down.;Fig. 11.20 Joint relative distributions of temperature and vertical velocity fluctuations at heights of (b) ZlZI 0.21 and (c) ZlZI 0.99 in the convective mixed layer (after Mahrt and Paumier, 1984, and Deardorff and WilliS, 1965).

(e) 7 rrrr t o.;Associated with the updrafts and downdrafts are corresponding horizontal convergence zones under thermals, and divergence above. The whole process is a circulation that moves air up and down in the mixed layer with a time period on the order oft.  zw., namely about 5 to 15 min. When the tops of the thermals rise into the statically stable air of the entrainment zone, they become negatively buoyant. This causes a deceleration of the rising thermal, and eventually leads to its sinking back down into the mixed layer. This process is sometimes called penetrative convection (Scorer, 1957 Deardorff, et aI., 1969, Stull, 1973).
