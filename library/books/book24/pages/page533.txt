Also, midlatitude nights last only 8 to 16 h, depending on the season and latitude. Thus, the full cycle of the oscillation might not be realized before daytime mixing destroys the nocturnal jet.;Table 121. Example of an inertial oscillation.;Statically stable environments support buoyancy waves, so we expect to find waves within the SBL (Gossard and Hooke, 1975). Weakly turbulent SBLs are usually filled with waves. Fig 12.19 shows a sodar record of waves near the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory tower (Hooke and Jones, 1986). This figure clearly exhibits the ubiquitous superposition of waves of various wavelengths and amplitudes.
