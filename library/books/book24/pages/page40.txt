Turbulence is an intrinsic part of the atmospheric boundary layer that must be quantified in order to study it. The randomness of turbulence makes deterministic description difficult. Instead, we are forced to retreat to the use of statistics, where we are limited to average or expected measures of turbulence. In this chapter we review some basic statistical methods and show how measurements of turbulence can be put into a statistical framework. Usually, this involves separating the turbulent from the nonturbulent parts of the flow, followed by averaging to provide the statistical descriptor. The role of spectra in this separation of parts is also described. Although at flrst glance we see a labyrinth of motions, turbulence may be idealized as consisting of a variety of differentsize swirls or eddies. These eddies behave in a wellordered manner when displayed in the form of a spectrum. Statistical descriptors such as the variance or covariance are of limited usefulness unless we can physically interpret them. Variances are shown to be measures of turbulence intensity or turbulence kinetic energy, and covariances are shown to be measures of flux or stress. Aux and stress concepts are explored further, and Einsteins summation notation is introduced as a shorthand way to write these variables. The concepts developed in this chapter are used extensively in the remainder of the book to help describe the turbulent boundary layer.;Since we have lived most of our lives within the turbulent boundary layer, we have developed feelings or intuitions about the nature of turbulence that can be reflned to help us classify and describe this phenomenon. Consider figure 2.1 for example, which shows the nearsurface wind speed measured during a 2.5 hour period. A number of features stand out.
