zO Awhere Div is the horizontal divergence. The last term on the right can be integrated and rewritten in terms of the mean large scale vertical motion, wL acting at the top of the ML (i.e., subsidence). Upon combining the above two equations and dividing by A, we fmd;(11.2.2a)where wL is negative for subsidence. When active clouds are present that vent air out of the top of the ML, the volume conservation equation can be rewritten as (Stull, 1985);(l1.2.2b)where JA is the fraction of sky covered by active clouds, and we is the average vertical velocity (positive upward) within the clouds at height Zj. When there are no clouds and no subsidence, (l1.2.2a) shows that the mixed layer top rises at a rate equal to we Subsidence can reduce the rise rate, or even push the ML down. Subsidence, however, can never inject air into the ML, because entrainment is controlled by we In convergent situations, the ML top can rise much faster than we Also, the total derivatives on the left side of both equations above can be split into local derivative and advective parts. Thus, advection of higher or lower ML depths into a region contribute to the local change, and should not be neglected.;Thermodynamic (Encroachment) Mixed.Layer Growth. One of the simplest ways to forecast ML depth and temperature is to focus only on the thermodynamics, and neglect the dynamics of turbulent entrainment. For example, consider the early morning potential temperature sounding sketched in Fig 11.12a. If later in the morning the temperature reaches a value 91, then the mixed layer depth at that time is Zjl assuming that the potential temperature within the whole mixed layer is constant with height. The amount of heat needed to reach this state is indicated by the shading in Fig 11.12a, and is given in units of Km. Obviously more heat is required to reach a deeper ML depth with a warmer ML temperature.
