In the last section we encountered heat fluxes with three components and momentum fluxes with nine components. It is very laborious to write a separate forecast equation for each of these nine fluxes, but seemingly necessary if we want to better understand the boundary layer. To ease the burden, we can employ a shorthand notation known as Einsteins summation notation. With just one term, we can represent all nine of the momentum fluxes. In this section, we first define some terms, then state rules with some examples, and finally show how summation notation and vector notation are related.;Let m, n, and q be integer variable indices that can each take on the values of 1, 2, or 3. Let Am represent a generic velocity vector, Xm represent a generic component of distance, and om represent a generic unit vector (a vector of length unity and direction in one of the three Cartesian directions). By using indices as subscripts to these generic variables, we can define;Let m, n, and q be integer variable indices that can each take on the values of 1, 2, or 3.

They represent distinctly different quantities that are not interchangeable. To help distinguish between these two quantities, remember that the Kronecker delta is a scalar and always
