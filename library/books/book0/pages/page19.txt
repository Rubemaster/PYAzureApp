 Rebecca J Barthelmie 20where   (, , ) is the 3component wind vector and   (cos  sin  , cos  cos  , sin ) is the unit directional vector representing the orientation of the laser beam. Here  is the elevation angle and  is the azimuth angle of the laser beam. Because the emitted laser pulse has a finite spatial extent, the backscattered radiation received at any moment is from a collection of aerosols illuminated by the laser pulse. Therefore, a radial velocity () measured at a location is a volumetric average of radial velocities within a probe volume centered at that location.;Figure 42 Schematic of the coordinate system employed in Eq. (8) where u1u, u2v and u3w.; A pulsed lidar emits a laser pulse of high energy characterized by its wavelength (), pulse duration () and pulse energy (). The returned signal is sampled with a sampling interval  and the range distance of the nth sample is resolved as 2 where c is the speed of light. Samples are binnedgated
