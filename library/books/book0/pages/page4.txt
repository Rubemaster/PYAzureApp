1 Introduction and motivation The purpose of this document is to briefly review some applications of remote sensing technologies to atmospheric flow conditions in the offshore environment with a specific focus on the wind energy industry. Our objective is not to present a comprehensive review of the entire body of prior research on in situ and remote sensing technologies, or to describe in detail the theoretical foundations of atmospheric conditions in the marine environment. Rather, we seek to document illustrative examples of previous research, and to use those to contextualize and summarize best practice recommendations for the offshore wind energy industry.;(3) Wind measurement devices based on optical remote sensing (groundbased, airborne, and satellite based techniques and applications (Hasager et al. 2008)) have been extensively developed over the past thirty years, in part in response to the demands of the wind energy industry. In Sections 4 and 5, we focus on groundbased and satelliteborne instrumentation, and provide a prcis of the technologies, uncertainty analyses, and best practice recommendations.
