A CW lidar represent instantaneous wind velocities and can have a very high temporal resolution (e.g., 0.002 seconds or 500Hz sampling frequency for the CW WindScanner from DTUWind (Ris)). For a pulsed lidar, each individual spectrum is derived from the signal from one laser pulse returned from a range gate therefore, its temporal resolution is determined by the number of pulses used for averaging (typically of the order of 1 second) and the pulse repetition frequency which specifies the number of laser pulses emitted per second by the lidar.;        is the equivalent sample number over which the averaging is taken. Here  isthe number of spectra or laser pulses giving the averaged spectrum,  is the observation time of a measurement from a range gate, and  is a measure of the correlation time scale of the pulse profile.;     SNR represents the effective number of photoelectrons coherently detected per observation time (Frehlich and Yadlowsky 1994). SNR is the signal to noise ratio.;   0.11 represents the independent sample numbers of the signal per range gate.;The equation above illustrates that spectrum averaging (increasing ) can reduce the standard error. All parameters except SNR in Eq. (9) are determined through lidar design. SNR is the ratio of the average heterodyne signal power to the average noise power and it can be estimated using the following equation (Huffaker and Hardesty 1996);Comparison between the observed SNR (median of 4600 observations) and the predicted SNR from Eq. (10) are shown in Figure 43. The agreement is very good even with the assumption that the backscatter and absorption coefficients are constant. The deviation of the peak location from the focal distance is due to the large 2 at this measurement site.
