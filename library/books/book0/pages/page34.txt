35  Rebecca J Barthelmiethe fact that scatterometerbased wind data are frequent in time and available over the long term is valuable for offshore wind resource assessment. Studies have shown that wind data from scatterometers can provide extremely useful information about inter and intraannual variability of wind speed (see section 2) (Capps and Zender 2010 Furevik et al. 2011 Karagali et al. 2014 Karagali et al. 2013 Liu et al. 2008).; There is increased emphasis in terms of the stateoftheart to integrate data from the different instrument suites into offshore wind resource estimates (Hasager et al. 2015).; There is a highdegree of uncertainty in extrapolating from the measurement height for satellite products to the heights of relevance to the wind energy industry (Badger et al. 2016).; SARscatterometer data can be used to develop initial wind resource maps and to characterize long term variability in wind speeds, they should be used as guide to site an offshore meteorological mast or groundbased remote sensing instruments for detailed assessment (Hasager et al. 2008).
