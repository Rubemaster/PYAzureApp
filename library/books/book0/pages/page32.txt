Currently, a priori knowledge of wind direction is needed for SAR wind retrieval because NSRC is acquired from a single antenna. The input wind direction is most commonly derived from either; The orientation of kmscale streaks visible on SAR images. The orientation of these streaks is aligned with wind direction, and they can be identified with imaging processing methods such FFT (Furevik et al. 2002), wavelet methods (Fichaux and Ranchin 2002) and gradient methods (Koch 2004). However, because wind direction 180 can cause the same streak orientation, there is 180 ambiguity.; Numerical weather prediction models. For example, the APLNOAA Wind Retrieval System (ANWRS) uses wind direction from the Global Forecast System (GFS) to retrieve wind speed from Radarstat12 data (Monaldo et al. 2014).; Scatterometers, if a SAR and scatterometer overpass each other simultaneously (He et al. 2005).; Insitu measurements where they are collocated with the SAR image (Christiansen et al. 2006).;New retrieval methods without required wind direction input can be found in (Dagestad et al. 2013).;The swath width is relatively narrow for SARs (100500 km) (Dagestad et al. 2013). The narrow swath causes the sample number of SARbased wind speed observation to be low at one location since the overpass rate is low. The sample number can be further reduced during winter time if the area included in SAR images has ice coverage. For example, it takes one day to acquire one sample at high latitude under the large swath mode and more than five days at the equator for the RADARSAT1 (RSI 1995). There were only 1009 samples and 63102 samples per month in total from 2003 to 2010 useful for wind resource assessment in the Baltic Sea (Hasager et al. 2011). Nonetheless, new instruments are being launched increasing the number of scenes available.;Wind speed retrieval from SAR images is limited to the range 224 m s1. The estimated wind speed from SAR data has a standard deviation of about 1.02.0 m s1 when evaluated against insitu measurements and model predictions (Hasager et al. 2008). Comparison with cup anemometer wind speeds versus SAR at Egmond aan Zee and Horns Rev found linear regression fits (and R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of y0.91x0.42 (R20.81) RMSE  1.47 ms1, and y0.98x0.14 (R20.88) and RMSE  1.26 ms1 (Hasager et al. 2015). The main source of uncertainty is the wind direction used for wind speed retrieval. For example, wind direction gradient in a SAR pixel can cause errors since uniform direction is assumed for wind retrieval. Errors are also introduced when atmospheric stability is not neutral because wind speed at 10 m height is based on extrapolation using the logarithmic law. If present, obstacles cause high returns and hence introduce positive bias.;SAR wind mapping is a useful tool for offshore wind resource assessment because SAR data can provide observations of wind speed variation over coastal areas at a resolution relevant to the size of offshore wind farms (Beaucage et al. 2008 Hasager et al. 2005 Monaldo et al. 2014). The wind speed spatial pattern derived from SAR data was used to extrapolate insitu measurements to create the Great Lake Wind Atlas (Doubrawa et al. 2015). While SAR data can provide good estimation of the annual mean wind speed, the limited sample number to date can introduce large uncertainty in estimating wind power density (Hasager et al. 2004 Hasager et al. 2011). Theoretical analyses show that, if the wind speed distribution is described using the Weibull distribution, about 70, 175 and 2000 samples are required to estimate the scale factor, the
