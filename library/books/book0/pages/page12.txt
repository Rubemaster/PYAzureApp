 kinetic energy (e.g. cup and propeller anemometers); cooling (e.g. hot wire or film anemometer); effective speed of sound in a moving reference frame (e.g. sonic anemometer).;Of these the majority of in situ measurements for the offshore wind energy industry conform to the second and fourth classes, although pitot tubes are have been employed for wind measurements on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, (Cho et al. 2011)) and on wind turbine blades and in wind tunnels during aerodynamic testing (Cooperman and Martinez 2015).;Properties of cuppropeller anemometers and wind vanes and guidelines on insitu measurements are well documented (Barthelmie et al. (2005) Brock and Richardson (2001) IEC (2005b) Pedersen et al. (2006) (Wyngaard 1981), and thus they are only briefly described here. A cup or propeller anemometer is used to measure the horizontal wind speed by virtue of rotation of one component of the anemometer (Figure 32 and Figure 33), and provide a scalar mean wind speed which is lower than the vector mean (Monahan 2011). The angular velocity of the rotor connected to the cups or propeller is linearly proportional to the horizontal wind speed for the cup anemometer or the wind velocity component along the axis of rotation for the propeller anemometer. The linearity is a function of anemometer design parameters and the coefficients (i.e., the slope and intercept) should be determined individually through wind tunnel calibration. A transducer, which can be a current generator or opticalpulse counting generator, is connected to the rotor to record the angular velocity that is used to estimate the incident wind speed using the calibrated linear response coefficients.;Figure 32 Cup anemometer and wind vane (Sourcewww.campbellsci.com)
