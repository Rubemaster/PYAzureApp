Radial velocities at the same range can be used to estimate the horizontal wind speed at the height associated with that range this is the socalled arc scan method (Wang et al. 2015). A low elevation angle is preferred for arc scan applications in order to reduce the effect of nonzero vertical velocity on the estimated wind speed. An RHI scan obtains observations on a vertical slice in the atmosphere by varying the elevation angle with a fixed azimuth angle (Figure 46) and are used for investigating flow structures on vertical planes. RHI scans have been used to study the structures and dynamics of low level jets (Banta et al. 2002) and evolutions of vortices in the wake of an aircraft (Kpp et al. 2004) and in the lee of a mountain (Weissmann et al. 2009).;Vertical profiles of wind speed can be obtained with the velocityazimuthdisplay (VAD) technique (used by ZephIR) or the Dopplerbeamswing (DBS) techniques (used by WINDCUBE). The VAD technique that uses PPI scans with 360 azimuth span (Figure 47) was first developed to estimate vertical profiles of wind speed from radar (Browning and Wexler 1968) and has been widely used in wind energy to measure vertical wind shear (Emeis et al. 2008 Pea et al. 2015b). The DBS technique swings the laser beam at the four cardinal directions and the vertical direction sequentially (Figure 48). Vertical wind speed is directly measured with the verticallypointing beam and then the westeast and southnorth wind components are deduced from radial velocities.
