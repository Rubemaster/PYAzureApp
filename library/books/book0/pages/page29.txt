Radial velocities from the two lidars are interpolated to the grid points using the weighted sum of radial velocities within a predefined volume. The twocomponent horizontal wind velocities can be directly derived on each grid point from the radial velocities of the lidars by assuming zero vertical wind speed. Threecomponent wind velocities can also be retrieved with the physical strain of the continuity equation, for example, using the Multiple Doppler Synthesis and Continuity Adjustment Technique (MUSCAT) (Bousquet and Chong 1998). Uncertainties of dual lidar techniques can be found in Stawiarski et al. (2013) and they are mainly related to the scanning geometry configurations. One common issue of dual lidar techniques, which was experience in several dual lidar applications, is the difficultly of synchronizing two lidars. Because of the probe volume and the different scanning geometries configured on different lidars, beams from two lidars can intersect within a spatial and temporal window. Therefore, wind velocities from dual lidar measurements are temporal averages, which require the assumption of stationarity.;The triple lidar technique can directly measure the instantaneous wind velocity by pointing their beams at the same location and was tested recently as a solution for wind measurements over complex terrain (Wang et al. 2016c). A synchronized triple lidar system with a centralized computer controlling the orientations of the beams from the three lidars has been recently developed Vasiljevic (2014) and applied to quantification of the spatial variability of nearsurface flow (Berg et al. 2015).;Figure 49 Schematic of the dual lidar virtual tower technique for offshore wind measurements (Image source www.pnnl.gov)
