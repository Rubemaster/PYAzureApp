The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) has sponsored the development of recommended practices for offshore wind turbine deployment (Offshore Compliance Recommended Practices Recommended Practices for Design, Deployment, and Operation of Offshore Wind Turbines in the United States (AWEA OCRP 2012)). It mirrors the major regulatory stages framed in 30 CFR 585 (Trager 2014) and addresses most aspects of the life cycle of a wind turbine facility (excluding the initial permitting) project design and design basis manufacturing construction, installation, and commissioning operation, inspection, and safety systems and decommissioning. It is intended for use with fixedbase offshore wind structures in U.S. federal and state waters and consistent with the IEC large wind turbine standards, applies to turbines with a swept area  200 m2. Beyond this, and the other recommendations cited herein, there are numerous other regulations, standards, and guidelines relevant to the offshore wind industry, including
