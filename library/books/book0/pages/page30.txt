Calibration and classification of lidar devices II. Procedures for site assessment III. Procedures for turbine assessment;These are also subdivided so that in addition to general practice for ground based lidar and nacelle mounted lidar, working groups have addressed issues of particular relevance to offshore including use of floating lidar, httpwww.ieawindtask32.orgwpcontentuploads201604IEA;The most comprehensive recommended practice report is by IEA Task 32 Working group.
