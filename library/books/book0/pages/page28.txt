There is always uncertainty in making assumptions required for wind velocity retrievals in complex flows (as described above), but lidars are poised to become the best instrument for observing the spatial variability of complex flows regardless. The solution to this challenge is the duallidar and triplelidar techniques which directly measure two and three components of the wind velocity at one location simultaneously from noncollocated two and three lidars, respectively. The dual or triple lidar techniques do not require the flow homogeneity assumption employed for single lidars.;Three types of dual lidar techniques have been applied and tested in various field experiments. The first one is the virtual tower technique first used by Calhoun et al. (2006) and Collier et al. (2005) to measure wind speed profiles in the urban atmospheric boundary layer. Virtual towers are formed on the intersecting lines of RHI scans made by two noncollocated lidars. By assuming zero vertical wind speed, the horizontal wind velocity can be directly measured at locations where the beams from the two lidar intersect. The virtual tower technique, as shown in Figure 49, can be used to measure wind velocity profiles offshore by placing two lidars on the coast. The second dual lidar technique is the coplanar technique (Hill et al. 2010). Two noncollocated lidars are coordinated to perform RHI scans with the same azimuth angle. The RHI scans are aligned with the baseline connecting the two lidars so that radial velocities are measured on a coplanar vertical plane. The horizontal and vertical components on the plane can be retrieved without any assumptions. Therefore, the coplanar technique is suitable for studying flow structures in vertical planes such as the mountain waves (Hill et al. 2010) and downslope flows (Cherukuru et al. 2015). The third dual lidar technique is able to observe wind velocities in a 3dimensional space using two noncollocated lidars
