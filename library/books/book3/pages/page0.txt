Box 1589, Solomons MD 20688, USA;The services of ecological systems and the natural capital stocks that produce them are critical to the functioningof the Earths lifesupport system. They contribute to human welfare, both directly and indirectly, and therefore represent part of the total econorllic value of the planet. We have estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes, based on published studies and a few original calculations. For the entire biosphere, the value (most of which is outside the market) is estimated to be in the range of US1654 trillion (10 12) per year, with an average of US33 trillion per year. Because of the nature of the uncertainties, this must be considered a minimum estimate. Global gross national product total is around US18 trillion per year.  1998 Elsevier Science B.V.
