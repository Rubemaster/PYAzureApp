Figure 3. Ranking of the variant scenarios according to stakeholders.;Figure 3. Ranking of the variant scenarios according to stakeholders.ranking of the Investor shows a clear disfavour for Scenario 1, which is the one with lower over all economic gains, whereas the rest of the scenarios are ranked more or less in similar position. The Project Developer showed analogous preference with the Investor. Scenario 1 is clearly dis favoured but not to the extreme extends as in the Investors ranking. Scenarios 2, 3 and 4 can be considered also almost indifferent to the Project Developer. When comparing all rankings together, it can be clearly seen that there is no alternative that ranks optimal for all stakeholders. Scenario 1 is the most preferred for some and the most disfavoured for others, making this scenario incompatible. To a certain extent, this is also the situation for Scenario 3. Scenarios 2 and 4 are ranked more neutral, without extreme difference between each stakeholders ranking. Between those two alternatives, Scenario 2 could be a better compromise variant because it has the lowest difference between the higher and lower ranking. In conclusion, a new alternative could be studied taking as a reference the variant scenario 2. The evaluation of criteria and their weights should be also reviewed by the decisionmakers and stakeholders to better represent the reality with the criteria, and to better express the stakeholders preferences. Then, the PROMETHEE II method should be run again and see how the newly defined alterative ranks.
