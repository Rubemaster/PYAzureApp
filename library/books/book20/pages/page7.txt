A number of other criteria have been assessed based on data taken from similar cases in the literature and adjusted to the circumstances, magnitude, and par ticularities of the specific case study. For a number of qualitative assessed criteria, a relative index has been established to indicatively provide for a comparative evaluation of the variant scenarios. A more analytic presentation of the criteria assessment process is subsequently unfolded.;The annual energy production (AEP) is calculated using the PARK module in WindPRO. The wind climate in the site is obtained by transferring climatological data from the nearest mete orological station available, namely Trawscoed weather station, 1215 km away from the site (Metoffice.gov.uk 2014). Wake interaction losses are taken into account and a reduction of 10 due to turbine downtime is considered. PARK calculates both the AEP and capacity factors and they give exactly the same information, one can calculate the capacity factor from the AEP and vice versa. Nevertheless, the capacity factor is used here as it is a better value to compare between wind projects of variant installed capacity. The capacity factor calculated in WindPRO for Scenario 3 is 36.9 which is higher than the one assumed by the developers (30) in their scoping document (SSE Renewables NantyMoch Scoping Document 2010). A reference capacity factor of 31, slightly higher than the one used by the developers, is used in Scenario 3 instead of the value obtained from WindPRO. Scenarios 2 and 4 have the same hub height with scenario 3 and their capacity factors are only adjusted accordingly to keep comparison consistency. To do so a correction factor of 0.84 is applied. On the other hand, the capacity factor in Variant 1 is not corrected as its hub height is much lower, 50 m height, so the energy content will be different than in the reference scenario. Having no reference values to compare with, the coefficient obtained from WindPRO is assumed. Table 3 shows the capacity factors finally used in this study.
