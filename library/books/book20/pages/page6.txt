The park layout is defined compact and centred in the area with highest wind resources. Scenario 2 consists of 31 wind turbines Vestas V90, 2.0 MW, with total installed capacity of 62 MW. The turbines hub height is 95 m. This scenario has exactly the half number of turbines than the reference scenario. Its layout is defined by using the layout of the original proposed project and discarding the most dispersed turbines, keeping the rest of turbines in a compact group. Scenario 3 is the current original wind project proposal. It consists of 62 generic wind turbines of 2.0 MW. The total installed capacity is 124 MW. The turbines models and manufacturer are not disclosed by SEE Renewables in their public reports. It is a common practice in the sector that the developers keep the possibility to change to another supplier in a later stage of the project. A generic wind turbine model is selected, with 2.0 MW rated power and 146.5 m total height. For consistency with scenarios 2 and 4, the hub height is kept at 95 m. Therefore, the turbine rotor diameter shall be approximately 100 m. The park layout is kept as the developers have designed. Scenario 4 is based on the employment of the largest capacity wind turbine that is available in the market for onshore applications with Classification IIA. That is Gamesa G128, 4.5 MW. The number of wind turbines is calculated to match the same installed capacity than in the reference scenario, 124 MW. Using 28 units of Gamesa G128, the total installed capacity is only a little higher, 126 MW. An overall presentation of all developed variant scenarios can be found in Table 1.;Given the background of local strong opposition to the wind farm, the criteria selected to compare each scenario include more socioenvironmental type of parameters into the decisionmaking process. Thirteen criteria are defined and presented below together with their particular way of assessment in the context of this case study (Table 2). Different ways of criteria assessment have been applied. For the energy produc tion criterion, the wellknown WindPRO software has been employed. WindPRO is a Windows modularbased software suite for the design and planning of wind farms (httpwww.emd.dkwindprofrontpage). It has been developed by EMD International AS and has been widely used for wind power project planning, design and resource assessment (Ozerdem et al. 2006 Hong and Mller 2011 Albani et al. 2013). For the assessment of a number of eco nomic and environmental criteria, the also renowned RETScreen software (www.retscreen.net) developed by the Ministry of Natural Resources Canada is used. RETScreen is an Excelbased clean energy project analysis tool that helps decision makers quickly and inexpensively deter mine the technical and financial viability of potential renewable energy, energy efficiency, and
