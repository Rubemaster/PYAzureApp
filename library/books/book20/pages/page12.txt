The investor puts high in the agenda the economic criteria, while the project developer shows a more balanced approach to criteria prioritisation.;PROMETHEE II is employed to provide for a compromise solution to the problem. The PROMETHEE indifference threshold has been set to 0. In the case of the preference thresh old p, a value equal to the difference between the maximum and the minimum for each criterion gj divided by n, the number of variants scenarios, was adopted as below (Haralambopoulos and Polatidis 2003);By connecting the preference threshold with the total number of scenariovariations, the dis criminative power of the method is emphasised the more alternatives there are, the more one needs a finer threshold to discriminate among them. This has the added advantage that it incorpo rates the analysts expertise in defining the various scenarios in such a way that relative distance between them is smoothed out with intermediate steps.;The net flow calculated with PROMETHEE II for each scenario is plotted to provide an easy visual comparison. The graphs for the five considered stakeholders in this study are consecutively shown in Figure 3. The Opposition Group has a clear preference of Scenario 1, with smaller turbines, over the rest of scenarios. Scenarios 2 and 4 are almost ranked the same, but much lower than Scenario 1. Scenario 3 (the current development proposal) is the one ranked lower, as expected. The Environ mentalist NGO has a very similar ranking as the Opposition Groups but less extreme. Scenario 1 is still the preferred variant but not with such a big difference over the rest. For the Regional Authority the alternatives are ranked quite close to each other. There is total indifference between scenarios 2 and 4 Scenario 1 is slightly preferred while Scenario 3 is slightly disfavoured. The
