14 H. Polatidis and J.B. Morales;In this paper a methodological framework for increasing the actual applicability of wind power projects has been established and applied in a case study in UK. The framework is based on MCDA techniques that can perform an integrated analysis and comparative evaluation of a number of potential projects that are a variation of a preexisting actual wind power project proposal that faces implementation difficulties. The process starts with the development of a number of variant scenarios and proceeds with the identification of pertinent criteria that are used to evaluate the developed variants. The criteria incorporate resourcebased, economic, environmental, societal and technological attributes that are considered relevant for an overall sustainability assessment of the potential variant projects. Particular thoughtfulness is given to the socioenvironmental criteria, since it possibly could be the case that they are not adequately incorporated in the design of the original project. Subsequently, an MCDA technique is employed to identify a suitable compromise solution among the created project alternatives. In the context of this study the PROMETHEE II outranking method is chosen due to its simplicity, ease of use, transparency, sound presentation of results and clear meaning of the parameters included. Finally, a number of decisionmakers are invited to participate in the weighting of the criteria according to their point of view. The result of the process could be a more applicable variant project alternative or the identification of a new way of searching for a compromise. The methodology is tested in a case study of a wind farm in the UK where strong opposition has arisen. Three variant project alternatives have been established and together with the initial proposal are successively comparatively evaluated. Thirteen criteria have been identified and assessed via particular software andor own calculations, assessments and adjustments based on data found in similar cases in the literature. Five indicative types of stakeholders have been iden tified as appropriate to participate in the specific decisionaiding process. In a roleplay workshop their preferences are defined and their weights are calculated indirectly using a hierarchical rank ing method. Results appear to identify a new direction of how a more applicable project could be established. It should be stressed that the aim of this paper is not to interfere with the par ticular permission application process but merely to complement to it and the results found and presented here are of an indicative nature. Nonetheless, the whole process, methodology, and application could be useful for practitioners in the field.;Afgan, N. H., M. G. Carvalho, and M. Jovanovic. 2007.
