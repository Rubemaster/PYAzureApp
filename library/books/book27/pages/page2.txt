In 2004, the policy was modified by the Royal Decrees, which also made changes in the wind tariff system in both 2004 and 2007 (GWEC, 2009). In Spain, the main determinant of tariff is technology, with a close focus on wind predictions. Under Spanish regulations (Alejo, 2011), windfarm owners sell their power to the grid and must predict how much wind power they will be contributing. The windfarm owners need to pay penalties for inaccurate prediction. In other national markets, wind farm owners are not penalized for prediction errors. However, the burden that this requirement places upon companies has turned into an advantage by leading to more accurate and reliable predictions. Spanish companies have taken the lead in microsite predictionforecasting what will happen at a specific turbine, given the meteorological conditions. The 1997 Electricity Power Act allowed small and medium size power plants to choose either a fixed rate or a premium rate plus the market price. The selection remains in effect for one year, and then wind power producers may choose whether to stay with the selected plan or change to the other option. In 2004, Royal Decree 4362004 stated that wind tariffs should be based on a certain percentage of the average electricity sector tariff (TMR in Spanish). Although the TMR level changes every year, the wind tariff has generally been approximately 8090 of the TMR. In 2007, Royal Decree 6612007 changed the wind tariff policy by introducing two new features use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the detailed adjustment of rates. The use of the CPI initiated the linkage of the tariff with the realtime price of electricity. The regulation sector also released a correction factor of 70.25 in order to benefit both end users and small and mediumsize power companies. In the end, although the rate increases slightly each year, the tariff generally remains stable, and the utility companies are able to tolerate a certain degree of annual inflation.;2.1.3. Denmark Wind energy in Denmark has proved to be an expensive way to reduce CO2 emissions it saves 2.4 million tons of CO2 per year, under a subsidy averaging 128 per ton of CO2 (CEPOS, 2009). Denmark ranks 9th in the world in cumulative wind capacity. However, it has experienced difficulties since 2000 because of the unstable policy support given to wind power development. The case of Denmark shows the sensitivity of capacity growth to stimulation policy. In the 1990s, the Danish government released policies that were very supportive to wind power, and which caused rapid capacity growth in the initial period. Under heavy subsidies, there were more than 4000 wind turbines in Denmark in 2000,;2.1.3.

Denmark ranks 9th in the world in cumulative wind capacity. However, it has experienced difficulties since 2000 because of the unstable policy support given to wind power development. The case of Denmark shows the sensitivity of capacity growth to stimulation policy. In the 1990s, the Danish government released policies that were very supportive to wind power, and which caused rapid capacity growth in the initial period. Under heavy subsidies, there were more than 4000 wind turbines in Denmark in 2000,twothirds more than in Britain although Denmark was only a fifth the size of Britain (GWEC, 2009). Danish installed wind capacity was 343 MW (76 of total capacity installed in Western Europe), with an average growth rate of 21. However, the original subsidies were too high, and became a tax burden on consumers. In order to stimulate industrial consumption of renewable energy, taxes were adjusted such that the utility tax for Danish households was 2.5 times higher than the industrial utility tax. Denmark has the worlds highest tax burden, and taxes and charges on electricity for household consumers are the highest in the EU 25. Consequently, in 2001, the newly elected Danish government reformed the subsidy policies related to wind power development.;Fig. 4 shows the significant growth trend in Danish wind power capacity from 1990 to 2011, a period that bridged across the 2001 policy reform. In the 1990s, wind power capacity grew rapidly at an average rate of more than 500 MW per year, while the industry received very strong support from government. In the 2000s, the capacity increase stalled because of the sudden elimination of beneficial policy. For instance, the installed wind capacity in 2000 was 637 MW, but it suddenly dropped to 107 MW in 2001 (with a substantial rebound in 2002) caused by uncertainties about the policy, and in the years from 2004 to 2008, there were barely any capacity increases in Denmark. This phenomenon clearly shows the influence of tariff policy on capacity growth. The 2000 policy introduced major changes in wind power subsidies newly installed turbines still received a fixed tariff of 4.4 centskW h, but no further subsidies. For existing turbines, the tariff remained the same, but the subsidy (3.6 centskW h) remained in effect only for very limited hours. Furthermore, from 2003 onward, all renewable energy immediately received the market price. Financial subsidies were replaced with green certificates. At the same time, in order to share the cost of the wind power subsidy, the energy price for consumers was raised to the highest in Europe (more than twice the British price). This change led to a public antiwindpower campaign, in which the government was pressured to explore other renewable sources. Policy support for wind power in Denmark was obviously overbeneficial in the 1990s, enabling a high growth rate at the beginning but leading to a policy reversal in the 2000s. Over beneficial tariff incentives do not necessarily help achieve CO2 reductions. According to CEPOS (2009), the cost of Danish wind power capacity to consumers is exacerbated by the countrys inability to use surplus electricity. Nearly all the excess wind derived power is exported to neighbouring countries, further depressing the price. Subsidies paid through taxation are also;Fig. 3.
