Energy Policy 53 (2013) 4150feedin tariffs, which are charges paid by a power transmission company to a power generation company. The paper will evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of Chinas current feedin tariffs on wind power and investigate the extent to which the feedin tariff policy has facilitated the sectors sustainable growth. International experience with onshore and offshore wind power will be useful in answering these questions. Section 2 of this paper reviews the literature pertinent to the earliestadopting countries, which started wind power development in Europe in the 1980s. The methodology described in Section 3 includes both conceptual and analytical frameworks. Section 4 evaluates Chinas wind power sector, and conclusions and policy recommendations are provided in Section 5.;Modern systems for wind power utilization were introduced to the world approximately 30 years ago. Since then, tariffbased stimulating policies have played a significant role in accelerating the development of wind power. Both Europe and the U.S. have received substantial recognition for wind power development however, because each individual state in the U.S. has its own regulations, this paper considers only European cases as reference points. In China, unlike Europe, government intervention plays a large role in promoting wind power development.;In this section, we shall focus on Germany, Spain and Denmark, all of which started developing wind power in the 1990s and introduced policy reforms around 2000. With the support of improved wind policies, Germany and Spain have achieved favourable environments for wind power development. Denmark, on the other hand, experienced a large decrease in development because of ineffective financial incentives.;2.1.1. Germany In 2011, Germany had 27.214 GW of wind capacity, which was the largest in Europe, represented 14 of global capacity (GWEC, 2011). Wind power promises to provide 30 of Germanys renew able energy supply in 2020, and 60 in 2050. Moreover, wind power is expected to produce 3040 of the total electricity;2.1.1.

A feedin tariff, called the Electricity Feed Law, was introduced in Germany in 1991. It was replaced by the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG in German) in 2000. The initial Electricity Feed Law was essentially a test of a feed in tariff, since Germany was among the first countries to connect wind energy into the electric grid. The purpose at that time was to stimulate further development of the wind industry. The EEG, which was applied to the wind power market when the stimula tion strategy was more mature, mainly considered wind resources and technology as the two determinants of tariffs. In term of grid connections, power from renewable resources had priority over power from traditional resources. The 2000 EEG introduced a fixed tariff, effective for a period of between five and 20 years. After that period, it could be reduced to a basic level. The year limit depended on local wind resources. In areas with good wind conditions, wind farms would receive the initial fixed tariff for fewer years. For areas with less wind resource, wind farms could receive the fixed tariff for longer periods. To increase turbine installation efficiency, the EEG cancelled compen sation for locations with a yield of less than 60 of the reference wind resource (GWEC, 2009). As shown in Fig. 2, wind power development remained at a very low level in the 1990s and then increased steadily after 2000. Policy incentives played a large role in this process. Instead of simply enabling development of wind farms to meet the 2020 and 2050 targets, the EEG maximized the advantages of wind farm locations and resource availability. It set the reference yield as a benchmark to determine the period of the initial tariff before the transition to more beneficial rates, based on the level of wind resource. Both fixed and basic tariffs have annual reduction rates. Driven by technology improvements, the tariff for a wind project devel oped in the year following the introduction of a new feedin rate could be reduced by a certain percentage (GWEC, 2009 p. 11). Advances in wind power technologies bring down the investment cost and, accordingly, the tariff rate decreases year after year. However, since the tariff is determined by both technology and wind resources, it can increase again if the wind resources of a particular year are poor. For example, the 2009 tariff went up because of the lack of wind resources that year.;2.1.2. Spain In the 1990s, Spanish wind power development was targeted for improvement. A new policy mechanism was implemented in 1997, and growth in power generation capacity mainly occurred after 2000. Fig. 3 shows the growth trend of Spanish onshore;Fig. 1.
