Although China is not ready to open its renewableenergy sector to market forces, policy guidance should be devised to lead regulations in a marketdriven direction. The three European countries discussed here did not confront completely free mar kets however, they are approaching marketdriven policies. Chinas wind power is still in its initial stages, and is not ready to replace thermal power. Policy supports should play a key role in leading its growth. Wind power in China is considered young in comparison with Europe. At this stage, China should learn from European experience. Simply increasing subsidy levels may be helpful to release the cost pressure in the short run it does not solve the problem for longterm development. Allaround technical and instrumental improvements are urgently required and can only be realized in a sound and meaningful policy environment.;Alejo, E., 2011. New Technologies in Spain Wind Power.
