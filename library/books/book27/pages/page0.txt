c Key components to exam Chinas wind power.c Evaluation of Europe could be helpful.;c Evaluation of Europe could be helpful.c China has to remove institutional barrier.;In the past 20 years, China has paid significant attention to wind power. Onshore wind power in China has experienced tremendous growth since 2005, and offshore wind power development has been on going since 2009. In 2010, with a total installed wind power capacity of 41.8 GW, China surpassed the U.S. as the country with the biggest wind power capacity in the world. By comparing the wind power situations of three typical countries, Germany, Spain, and Denmark, this paper provides a comprehen sive evaluation and insights into the prospects of Chinas wind power development. The analysis is carried out in four aspects including technology, wind resources, administration and timespace frame. We conclude that both German and Spanish have been growing rapidly in onshore capacity since policy improvements were made. In Denmark, large financial subsidies flow to foreign markets with power exports, creating inverse costbenefit ratios. Incentives are in place for German and Danish offshore wind power, while China will have to remove institutional barriers to enable a leap in wind power development. In China, crosssubsidies are provided from thermal power (coalfired power generation) in order to limit thermal power while encouraging wind power. However, the mass installation of wind power capacity completely relies on power subsidies. Furthermore, our study illustrates that capacity growth should not be the only consideration for wind power development. It is more important to do a comprehensive evaluation of multisectorial efforts in order to achieve longterm development.  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For instance, Chinas wind power capacity increased from 4,200 kW in 1980 to 41.8 GW in 2010. China surpassed Germany and Spain in 2009, and then surpassed the 40.2 GW capacity of the U.S. in 2010 to be ranked number one in the world in total wind power capacity. As shown in Fig. 1, the annual rate of capacity increase from 2000 to 2010 was around;50. China will have 150230 GW of installed wind power capacity by 2020 (Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), 2009). This paper aims to investigate whether existing supportive policies are optimal for assisting Chinas wind power capacity growth, which is a popular topic that receives high attention from worldwide researchers. Most voices nowadays encourage China to increase wind capacity from different aspects, for instance, Li, H. Guo, S. and Wang, B. have pointed out the importance of on shore wind power technical innovations in terms of accelerating capacity growth, whereas He, J., Zhao, X., and Yang, S. raised their supportive recommendations of developing offshore wind farms. The argument of this paper is that capacity growth should not be the only objective of Chinas wind power development at this stage, since neither policy schemes nor technology are completely built to fit in Chinas scenario. The focus of this paper is on policy scheme development in terms of tariff instruments, specifically,;Contents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirectjournal homepage www.elsevier.comlocateenpol;03014215  see front matter  2012 Elsevier Ltd.
