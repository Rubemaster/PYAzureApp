This excessive support is obviously unsustainable it helped Danish wind power development reach a shortterm peak, but tax refunds and output subsidies soon became heavy burdens on the budget (Morthorst, 1999 p. 11). While the Danish government wished to encourage capacity growth, overinvestments in the early stages of wind power development were not effective.;2.1.4. China Both Germany and Spain are emphasizing the technology factor. Germany additionally considers the sizes of power producers, while Spain relies on technical support of wind forecasting, which is another way to maximize resources. In the case of China, there are very limited policy incentives based on either technology or resource distribution, but considerable emphasis on financial investments, which is very similar to the Danish policy of focusing on heavy subsidies. China has three financial sources for its subsidies the clean development mechanism (CDM), governmen tal subsidies, and electricity sales. CDM provides a large amount of international financial aid, with each kW h of wind power receiving 8 cents (CNY) in subsidies but the CDM funding criteria exclude many domestic wind projects. In contrast, governmental subsidies are a major force in accelerating the development of wind power. In 2010, China invested 103 billion CNY, at 32.72 annual growth, representing 26.14 of its total power sector investment (Cheng et al., 2011). Fig. 5 shows that Chinese wind power subsidies grew rapidly from 2002 (138 million CNY) to 2008 (2.38 billion CNY). In China, part of the profit from thermal power is used to subsidize wind power. In 2009, such crosssubsidies for renewable energy were raised from 0.2 centkW h to 0.4 centkW h, and in 2011, the thermal power charge was increased by 2.6 centskW h to support another increase in the crosssubsidy to 0.8 centkW h. Since 2006, tariff rates have been determined on the basis of bidding. Provinces with rich wind resources, such as Inner Mongolia, Jilin, and Gansu, adjusted tariffs inside each province based on the lowestcost bids for building new wind power projects. As a result, the annual growth of Chinas wind power market reached 60 in 2006, followed by three consecutive years (20072009) of more than 100 growth in installed capacity (GWEC, 2009). In 2009, the national development and reform commission (NDRC see Li et al., 2011) released NDRC Pricing Reg. (2009) 1906, which divided Chinas onshore wind resource into four categories and each category has a different benchmark tariff. The government applied price floor, which means the result of bidding is limited to a certain minimum price, to prevent the price;2.1.4.

The government applied price floor, which means the result of bidding is limited to a certain minimum price, to prevent the pricefrom going below the cost (China Renewable Energy Committee, 2009). As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1, floor prices of the four categories vary from 0.51 to 0.61 CNYkW h, reflecting the concept that the better the average wind conditions, the lower the tariff level should be.;Offshore wind power has advantages in comparison with onshore wind power. For instance, wind tends to blow more consistently over the ocean than on land, coastal regions are generally denser with respect to energy consumption, impact on the landscape is minimized, and noise sources are further away from residential areas. On the other hand, high installation and maintenance costs, plus lack of expertise and experience, are currently major concerns for offshore wind power development. In most countries, offshore wind power systems are implemented by large companies because of the high cost of investment and long period of financial return. Europe has around 10 years of experience in developing offshore wind power, while China has only 12 years. Worldwide, offshore wind capacity growth is still in a testing period, with the potential for further improvement. In this section, we will look only at Germany and Denmark as case studies, since Spanish offshore wind power development is at a disadvantage because the majority of wind companies there are small or mediumsize.;2.2.1.
