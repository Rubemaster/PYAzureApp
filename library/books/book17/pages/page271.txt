Figure 7.3 Species composition of birds recorded at offshore platforms in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (a, b) and in the German North Sea (c, d), as bymeans of visual observations (a, c) and by automated flight call recordings (b, d). Other wading birds in (a) comprise herons, egrets, ibises and the like, unidentified calls in (b) include Catharus thrushes, orioles, tanagers and nonpasserines such as herons. Data in (a) from Russell (2005), (b) from Farnsworth  Russell (2007), (c) from Hill et al. (2014a) with supplemental information from the authors, and (d) from Hppop et al. (2012);The majority of nocturnally migrating birds typically departs within the first 13 hours after sunset (e.g. Drost 1931 Alerstam 1990 kesson et al. 1996 Schmaljohann et al. 2009 2011 Mller et al. 2016) when navigationrelevant twilight cues become available (e.g. Cochran et al. 2004 Muheim et al. 2006 Sjberg  Muheim 2016). There is however, considerable variation in observed nocturnal departure times, mainly due to an individual combination of intrinsic and current extrinsic factors. As such, individual body condition and ambient wind conditions define the main drivers of departure decisions in general (Mller et al. 2016) (see Figure 7.4) and at ecological barriers in particular (Schmaljohann et al. 2009 Mller et al. 2016).
