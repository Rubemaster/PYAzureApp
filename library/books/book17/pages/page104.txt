Wind farms will induce artificial upwelling, implying thatnutrient levels will increase in the productive zone and thereby ultimately increasing primary production. A more comprehensive analysis requires a coupled physical biogeochemical model, and probably also expertise on how ecosystem regimes may change in response to increased nutrient levels. However, it is an interesting exercise to provide some possible numbers on the induced productivity. As a reference, it is assumed that the North Sea has an area of 750,000 km2 and annual production is roughly 3050 g carbon (C)m2 per year (Richardson  Pedersen 1998 Richardson et al. 2000 Heath  Beare 2008), or thus roughly 2040106 t Cyear for the entire North Sea. The North Sea may not be the best example since the southern North Sea is well mixed and nutrients originate from rivers rather than from upwelling. However, this area is used here as there are many plans for offshore wind farms. The calculations will be relevant for the northern rather than the southern North Sea. Readers should note that these calculations use new annual production this is different from total annual net production, which includes recirculation of nutrients. Total annual net production is frequently a factor of two larger than new production.;The calculations made here are based on some simplifications that may influence the results significantly. It is therefore not a best estimate but rather a simple and rough calculation to highlight the possible impact of the artificially induced upwelling. The assumptions are
