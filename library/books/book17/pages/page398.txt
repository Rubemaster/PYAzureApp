Figure 9.7 Great Blackbacked Gull Larus marinus the species ranked by Furness et al. (2013) as the most vulnerable to collision with turbines of all 38 seabirds or species strongly associated with the sea, occurring in Scottish waters. The list included Whitetailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla, a species known to be particularly vulnerable to collision with turbines onshore (de Lucas  Perrow 2017), which was ranked fourth. (Martin Perrow);Work on sensitivity indices was extended by Wade et al. (2016) to reflect uncertainty around some of the factors used for particular species. Although the Furness et al. (2013) vulnerability rankings remained broadly similar to those of Garthe and Hppop (2004), the uncertainty indices identified species for which data were more robust. As such, they also inform qualitative discussion of any assessment results, particularly for those species where uncertainty around their vulnerability is highest. In addition, uncertainty can be used to identify areas for strategic monitoring and research.;Bradbury et al. (2014) built on the methods of Furness et al. (2013) to develop a sensitivitymapping tool for seabirds in English waters (SeaMAST). Sensitivity in this case is governed by areas of higher use by different seabirds, which in turn is likely to be linked to the distribution of breeding colonies in the breeding season, as
