The fish showed a strong seasonal variation in presence at the turbines. During summer and autumn, many of the fish were highly resident as they were present for an extended period and detected on a daily basis. By the end of December, however, most of the fish had left the area and throughout the winter very few detections were encountered. In the spring of the following year, some of the fish reappeared (Figure 5.9). Based on triangulation, the receivers allowed the exact position of the fish when sending out an acoustic signal to be calculated. This further allowed the link between fish position and habitat type to be established. The turbines with scour protection form artificial hard substrates with rocks and pebbles, while the surrounding area consists of sandy sediments. Although soft sediments dominate the study area and only small patches of hard substrates are available, most of the detections from tagged fish were over or in close vicinity to the hard substrates (Figure 5.10). More than 95 of the calculated positions were situated within a 50 m range from the wind turbines, revealing strong aggregation behaviour of the study fish towards the hard substrates.;Figure 5.9 Detection plots of tagged Atlantic Cod over time (upper) overview from the entire study (lower) detail from 25 May 2011 to 19 October 2011.
