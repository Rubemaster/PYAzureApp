Table 1.1 Overview of the environmental effects of the varying activities involved in construction, operation and decommissioning of an offshorewind farm that typically require assessment.a;The aim of this chapter is to provide an introduction to offshore wind as the basis for subsequent technical chapters. Specifically, this chapter will aim to provide a description of the physical components of an OWF, the installation and operational requirements, the key legislative tools employed in the consent process and the basics of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). The breadth of engineering required to build a wind farm is sufficient for a weighty tome of its own. Therefore, detail in this chapter is limited to the basics required to understand what exactly developers are seeking permission for and where opportunities for interaction with environmental receptors may arise. As legislation can vary between countries, this chapter will only provide examples from a range of countries active in offshore wind, to enable the reader to understand the variances between countries. Specific examples will be provided for the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, China, Japan, Taiwan and the USA.
