Although more work is needed before accurate statements onenvironmental impacts can be made, there is increasing evidence that wind farms do have a local influence on the environment (Baidya Roy  Pacala 2004 KirkDavidoff  Keith 2008 Baidya Roy  Traiteur 2010 Baidya Roy 2011 WalshThomas et al. 2012 Zhou et al. 2012, 2013 Zhang et al. 2013 Takle 2017). Local influence is mainly derived from the increased turbulence levels due to the turbines. More turbulence means more mixing and the turbulent exchanges of heat and moisture are altered and, in general, the surface becomes drier. The exact response depends on the vertical stratification, but most often it is expected that in the presence of turbines the surface will become cooler in the daytime while the surface grows warmer during the nighttime. It may also be noted that if projections for future windenergy requirements are true, it is likely that wind farms will have an impact on the global climate (Keith et al. 2004 KirkDavidoff  Keith 2008 Santa Maria  Jacobson 2009 Wang  Prinn 2010 Vautard et al. 2014). The projections indicate that the global climate will not change much, but that there will be regional changes in temperature that exceed 1C. This is mainly the result of the increased drag that the turbines place on the atmosphere. It is also likely that the changes in atmospheric temperature and wind directions, and perhaps also storm tracks, will have an impact on the water cycle (Takle 2017). This has not been studied to the same extent, but may be an important effect to consider in future studies.;In the same way that each wind turbine will have a particular wind wake that stretches downwind, and spreads upwards and downwards to the surface, the wind farm, as a collection of turbines, will leave a similar pattern behind itself. The wake behind an entire wind farm has been much less studied than the wake behind each turbine, for the simple reasons that the wake behind each turbine is (i) easier to study and (ii) has considerable economic value as it connects directly to energy production and windfarm optimisation. Thus, the extent of the wind wake behind large wind farms is much less understood than the wake from each turbine. Nonetheless, it may be claimed with some certainty that the wind velocity is reduced by, say, 1030 and possibly up to 50, compared to the surrounding area (Christiansen  Hasager 2005 Fitch et al. 2012 Ludewig 2013, 2015) The size of the wake
