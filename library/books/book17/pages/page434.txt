The consent for wind farms within foraging range of a variety of breeding seabirds at large colonies such as Bempton Cliffs within the Flamborough Head and Filey Coast SPA, with connectivity to the Hornsea sites (Langston  Teuten 2018), and the four wind farms in the Firth of Forth, with connectivity to a number of colonies including those within the Forth Islands and Fowlsheugh SPAs (Cleasby et al. 2015), provides an invaluable opportunity to test the link between reproductive status and displacement for species such as Northern Gannet. Outside the breeding season, this species strongly avoids operational wind farms (see Vanermen  Stienen, Chapter 8), but if it is not displaced during the breeding season, it is likely to be vulnerable to collision, especially as an aerial foraging species that encroaches into the risk zone when foraging compared to commuting (Cleasby et al. 2015) (see Collision with turbines, below).;That at least some species are displaced from operational wind farms begs the question of what causes the negative response. Compared to construction, operational noise levels are much reduced, as is vessel traffic, thereby suggesting that the visual disturbance of the turbines is the dominant factor. However, it may not simply be the presence of spinning blades that is disruptive, as some studies suggest that the standing structures are as equally scary as the structures with moving parts, as was the case for Common Eider Somateria mollissima in the study by Larsen and Guillemette (2007). Similarly, Harwood et al. (2017) provide some evidence of the apparent avoidance of standing structures by Sandwich Tern, all the more surprising for an agile, fastflying seabird.;In general, however, studies have not routinely distinguished between possible sources of disturbance from the turbines and thus the wind farm as a whole, including noise, shadow effect or movement of the blades. In other cases, the patterns observed may be caused indirectly through changes in the distribution and abundance of prey, rather than linked directly to the activity itself (see Foodweb and indirect effects, below). Teasing apart causal and proximate factors remains a particular challenge bearing in mind that even with rigorous and intensive monitoring coupled with
