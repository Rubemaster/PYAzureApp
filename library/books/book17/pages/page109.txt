(Christiansen  Hasager 2005 Fitch et al. 2012 Ludewig 2013, 2015). Christiansen and Hasager (2005) and Fitch et al. (2012) find and predict that the deficit in the wind stress is about 2030, while Ludewig (2015) finds a deficit in the wind stress that is up to 70. Variation in results will influence the predictions of the wind wake effects from wind farms, and their consequences on upper ocean dynamics and marine life. More research on this subject is clearly needed.;Figure 3.5 Offshore windfarm (OWF) induced change in the 10 m wind field after 4 h operating wind turbines, simulated with the MEsoscale TRAnsport and Stream (METRAS) model, based on a southwesterly geostrophic wind of 8 ms.
