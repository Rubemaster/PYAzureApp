The pathways responsible for any effects and impacts are detailed, with particular emphasis on noiserelated effects and impacts due to the importance of hearing for many species (Box 6.2). The information presented has generally focused on a limited number of species that are of particular importance within Europe, particularly the Harbour Porpoise and Harbour Seal. As such, the chapter is naturally biased towards these two species but the experience gathered from studies on existing wind farms may provide valuable material to inform potentially critical projects in areas where such experience is not available (Tougaard  Mikaelsen 2017).;Potential effects and impacts of anthropogenic noise upon marine mammals range from negligible effects in relation to a single short disturbance event, to direct physical and even fatal injury. The latter may occur from exposure to very high levels of sound such as from shock waves from explosions damaging internal organs or airfilled body cavities (Young 1991). Noise thus may cause auditory and nonauditory effects.;A framework of potential impacts proposed by Richardson et al. (1995) has been widely adopted, including in windfarm studies. This suggests four zones of auditory noise impact for marine mammals (1) zone of audibility (2) zone of responsiveness (3) zone of masking and (4) zone of hearing loss, discomfort and injury.;The zone of audibility is the threshold at which a noise is detectable above background noise and above the hearing threshold of an animal, while the zone of responsiveness refers to the threshold above which a behavioural reaction (positive or negative) to the noise is elicited. Above a certain noise level this may result in disturbance in form of cessation or modification of normal activities such as feeding, social interactions and vocalisations, and displacement including animals leaving the water in the case of seals (Richardson et al.
