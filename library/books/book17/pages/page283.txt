Weller et al. 2016 Taylor et al. 2017). A further expansion of this technology via an increased number of strategically positioned stations offers new opportunities to assess the temporal and regional movement patterns of individual species (Lagerveld et al. 2017 Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5).;Many migrating birds avoid entering or crossing wind farms (Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Masden et al. 2009 Plonczkier  Simms 2012 Aumller et al. 2013 Dierschke et al. 2016). For example, Environmental Impact Assessment studies in the context of wind turbine construction in the German Bight revealed a significant reduction of species numbers in the direction of a wind farm (Aumller et al. 2013 Hill et al. 2014b). In divers Gavia spp. and Northern Gannets Morus bassanus, common migrating seabirds in the German Bight, the observed migration event rate reduced to onethird in the direction of a wind farm (Aumller et al. 2013). On the other hand, Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo and European Shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis often show strong attraction to OWFs (Dierschke et al. 2016 Vanermen  Stienen, Chapter 8), whereas that of several gull species (Hill et al. 2014b Schulz et al. 2014) and Redbreasted Merganser Mergus serrator is weaker, although still classed as attraction. From this, one might conclude that wind farms have only small barrier effects on migrants of these species.;In general, avoidance rates strongly depend on external conditions (Chamberlain et al. 2006). During the day and under good visibility, flocks of migrating seaducks and geese actively change their flight path at a distance of at least 12 km to avoid entering a wind farm (Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Pettersson 2005 Petersen et al. 2006 Krijgsveld et al. 2011). At Kalmarsund (Baltic Sea), this avoidance behaviour led to displacement in the overall migration pattern of waterfowl by about 2 km after construction of the wind farm (Pettersson 2005). Deviations from the migratory trajectories, however, result in an increase in flight distance and thus in energy expenditure, although avoiding one wind farm will not seriously increase energy expenditure. Masden et al. (2009) measured the detour taken by Common Eiders Somateria mollissima
