The species at risk are identified, although with limited offshore evidence this also draws on previous reviews of collision fatalities at onshore and coastal wind farms such as Cook et al. (2014). Quantitative data such as collision rates per turbine are not reported, as methods of data collection and analysis are not standardised and may not translate to an offshore context. The evidence review is restricted to relatively few seabird species including gulls and terns (Laridae), gannets (Sulidae), skuas (Stercoraiidae) and petrels and shearwaters (Procellariidae), owing to the location of constructed OWFs. While divers (Gaviidae) and auks (Alcidae) may occasionally collide with turbines, they generally fly below rotor height and are more likely to experience populationlevel effects from displacement. Species such as ducks, swans, geese, waders and passerines, which may be exposed to collision risk while on migration, are discussed by Hppop et al. in Chapter 7 of this volume.;The factors that may contribute to collision risk are then examined, including speciesspecific factors, locational factors and sitespecific design (Marques et al. 2014). This is followed by an appraisal, in the context of existing evidence, of sensitivity indices that have been developed to identify collision vulnerability for individual seabird species and to identify sea areas where collision risk may be high.;The review draws on openaccess internet search engines such as Google Scholar for both peerreviewed and grey literature. Search terms used were offshore wind bird and collision. A targeted search for grey literature was also carried out on the websites of UK government departments dealing with planning consent and other sites that collate research on seabirds at OWFs.;Offshore, collision detection has been attempted using a range of methods (Desholm et al. 2006 Collier et al. 2012 Mollis et al.,
