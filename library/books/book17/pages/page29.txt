 Monopile. These relatively simple structures comprise cylindrical steel tubes (Figure 1.6) driven into the seabed to a depth governed by site conditions. They are an economical choice in shallower waters but less suitable in deeper waters or for larger turbine models. The installation process for monopiles usually requires the use of a jackup vessel, which is raised on four steel legs to ensure stability and the precise positioning of the vessel. The jackup vessel will have a heavy lift crane and offshore piledriving hammer on board. The heavylift crane is used to lift the monopile into place with the driving hammer positioned above the pile, then a hydraulicsystem releases a heavy weight down on to the pile, driving it into the seabed. The forces required to drive the pile vary depending on the size of hammer required and will emit varying levels of peak noise when hammering. This noise is of particular concern as it can be harmful to marine mammals, damaging their hearing, either temporarily or permanently, depending on their distance from the source (Table 1.1).;Figure 1.6 Offshore wind substructure designs according to water depth.
