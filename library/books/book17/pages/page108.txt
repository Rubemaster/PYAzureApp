Figure 3.4 Map of the investigation area around test wind farm Alpha Ventus. Wind turbines are marked in blue conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) measurements are marked by red crosses, and the Fino1 platform is marked with a black square. Black arrows indicate the direction of the ship track during CTD measurements along sections west, north, east and south. (After Ludewig 2015);The change in the wind field simulated by METRAS is illustrated in Figure 3.5. In front of the OWF placed in the centre of the model area, there is a surge area with slightly decreased wind speeds. Behind the wind farm a wind wake develops, with a maximum wind deficit of around 70. Two areas with wind speeds increased by about 10 can be found at the flanks of the wind wake. The affected area is approximately 100 times bigger than the wind farm itself, with a wind wake length of more than 100 km. This wind wake is much longer than considered in Brostrms (2008) study, but is consistent with Fitch et al. (2012), for example. In addition, the wind deficit in the wake is stronger than suggested by Brostrm (2008), but here results from different studies do not converge
