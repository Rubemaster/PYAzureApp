Figure 3.3 shows a simulation based on an idealised wind wake from a wind farm of 55 km2 under a wind speed of 7.5 ms and where the wind wake is about twice as long as the wind farm (see also Brostrm 2008). The results show an upwellingdownwelling dipole that is 2040 times as large as the wind farm itself, and where the upwellingdownwelling areas are of about equal size. The resulting vertical velocity is about 0.51 mday and the total upwelling is thus in the order of 2108 m3day. If the upwelling brings nutrientrich water to the surface it will lead to increased primary production (Box 3.4). It is noted that the wind wake used by Brostrm (2008) is based on very crude assumptions it seems likely that the assumed size of the wind wake is actually too small, and increasing the length of the wake will increase the areas ofupwelling and downwelling. The longterm evolution of the upwellingdownwelling pattern also needs further investigation. Nevertheless, both Paskyabi and Fer (2012) and Ludewig (2013, 2015) theoretically confirmed the general predictions of Brostrm (2008). In particular, Paskyabi and Fer (2012) showed that the impact on the ocean may become stronger if the role of surface waves for the airsea exchange of momentum is accounted for. Further details of the study by Ludewig (2013, 2015) are provided below, in Empirical evidence of upwelling and Effects on temperature.;Figure 3.3 Disturbance of the thermocline after 1 day (left panels) and after 5 days (right panels) for a background wind speed of roughly 5 ms (upper panels) and 7.5 ms (lower panels) (see also Brostrm 2008). The red squares represent the position of the 55 km2 wind farm in the simulations. Colours are measured in metres.
