Completed in 2009, Alpha Ventus was the first official offshore wind farm in the German exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The Research at Alpha Ventus (RAVE) initiative, consisting of more than 20 subprojects, accompanied the development,construction and operation of the site. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the influences of wind farms on the marine environment and to improve knowledge about the dynamics and forces that act on turbines. RAVE was sponsored by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) following a resolution by the German Federal Parliament.;The Alpha Ventus wind farm is located in a water depth of about 30 m in the southern part of the German Bight, 45 km north of the island of Borkm (Figure 3.1). The considerable distance of the site from the coast, with prevailing westerly winds, was to guarantee profitable amounts of renewable energy.;Figure 3.1 Position of the Alpha Ventus wind farm (red point) and model area (blue square), which covers 240240 km2 and has an ocean depth of 30 m.
