(Ben Barden); Interarray cables between individual wind turbines and between turbines and offshore platforms use AC of medium voltage, typically 33 kV, although higher voltage designs such as 66 kV are beginning to be used more often. These are advantageous in terms of reducing electrical losses within the array and reducing cable lengths required within the wind farm, as a larger number of turbines can be accommodated on a single circuit. The use of higher voltage interarray cables can, in some cases, remove the need for offshore transformation, and therefore the need for offshore substation platforms, as the interarray cables can essentially transport electricity from the windfarm array directly to shore.
