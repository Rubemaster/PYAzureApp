Although gathering empirical evidence on bird collisions is complicated, research is being undertaken to understand the true collision risk and so better inform collision risk models. Until sufficient evidence is available, however, the precautionary approach is adopted when considering collision risk to seabirds.;Significant progress is being made in understanding the environmental impacts of OWFs (e.g. Huddlestone 2010 Skeate et al. 2012 BSH  BMU 2014 Shields  Payne 2014 Kppel 2017). Researchers have targeted a number of key themes, including the establishment of baseline conditions, behavioural responses of species to the installation and operation of OWFs, and the development of methods to model and measure impacts in a more meaningful way. In addition, several collaborative research programmes have been set up to advance and improve the understanding of environmental impacts of offshore wind, including the registered charity Collaborative Offshore Wind Research Into the Environment (COWRIE) and the Offshore Renewables Joint Industry Programme (ORJIP), which involves several governmental organisations, offshore wind developers, statutory nature conservation bodies, academics and leading experts. Research outputs from both programmes are part of a growing body of evidence that, collectively, will better inform consenting decisions and improve the scientific knowledge base.;The technical chapters in Volume 4 of this series provide further detail on the understanding regarding the monitoring and mitigation of offshore wind environmental impacts. The more typical aspects that require assessment during the various stages of construction, operation and decommissioning are outlined in Table 1.1. The rest of the chapters in this volume provide further detail on the potential effects arising from offshore wind deployment upon coastal processes (Chapter 2), ocean dynamics (Chapter 3), and a range of marine life including benthos or seabed communities (Chapter 4), fish (Chapter 5), marine mammals (Chapter 6), migratory birds and bats (Chapter 7) and seabirds (Chapters 8 and 9).
