Data are shown as mean  1 SE, with the number of samples in parentheses. Highest to lowest numbers over the different periods for each buoy are shown by graded colours from red to orange, yellowand green.;Table 10.2 Number of Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis recorded on navigation buoys in different locations around Sheringham Shoal wind farm during the different periods in the 2014 breeding season prebreeding in April, incubation in May, provisioning in June and postbreedingfledging period in July.;Peak mean counts were observed in the prebreeding period on all buoys (Table 10.2), reflecting the propensity of local breeding birds to range farther at this time, while there is no pressure to incubate eggs or provision chicks. It is also possible that birds on migration to more northerly colonies in the UK such as the Farne Islands or Coquet Island also use the buoys en route. Numbers of terns dropped during the incubation period to the lowest levels in the provisioning period, before rising again once chicks had fledged (Table 10.2). In the fledging and postbreeding period, the northeast and especially the south east buoy held the greatest numbers of terns (Table 10.2), again possibly because of their proximity to foraging areas.;As well as Sandwich Terns, small numbers of Common Tern Sterna hirundo and Common Gull Larus canus were observed utilising buoys alongside Sandwich Terns on occasion. Large gulls, especially Great Blackbacked Gull, were also regularly recorded, with these displacing terns from the buoys.;In 2015, the buoys were removed, presumably as the needs of navigational safety were met by what had become a welllit operational site. While a considerable decline in the density of birds utilising the site (unpublished data) was observed, this could not be entirely attributed to the loss of the buoys, as a result of the coincidental failure of the Blakeney Point colony relative to the rise of the Scolt Head colony at much greater distance from Sheringham Shoal (closest point of 33.5 km).
