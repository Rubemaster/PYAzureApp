Virtually nothing is presently known about collisions of bats with artificial offshore structures. Onshore, mortality rates of bats related to wind turbines vary considerably between sites and range from zero to 70 killed bats per turbine per year (Arnett et al. 2008 Rydell et al. 2010a Brinkmann et al. 2011 Barclay et al. 2017a). Regarding the slow life history of bats with relatively long lives, low natural mortality, and low reproduction rates (Barclay  Harder 2003), increased mortality related to wind power poses a serious problem in bat conservation (Kunz et al. 2007 OShea et al. 2016). Mortality of bats at onshore wind turbines is highest during the migratory seasons (Rydell et al. 2010a) and annual mortalityrates vary with distance of the wind parks to the bats suspected migration routes (Rydell et al. 2010b and references therein). Bats rarely collide with tall, static anthropogenic structures (Crawford  Baker 1981 Barclay et al. 2017a) and the main causes of death in onshore wind parks are collisions with moving blades or barotrauma caused by a sudden change in air pressure (Rydell et al. 2010a Barclay et al. 2017a). Onshore, collisions of bats with turbines blades occur predominantly while foraging for insects (Rydell et al. 2010b), searching for roosts at the nacelles (Cryan  Barclay 2009 Cryan et al. 2014a) or just passing the rotorswept area, mainly during low wind and high temperatures (Arnett et al. 2011 Amorim et al. 2012).;Factors determining bat migration intensity and behaviour may also help to explain the variation in bat mortality at onshore wind farms. According to Cryan and Brown (2007), it is likely that, with the growing trend towards installation of wind farms in offshore waters, turbines will have an impact on bats in marine habitats as well as on land. For some bat species, such as Hoary Bat, this expanded development is considered likely to contribute to potentially serious population declines (e.g. Zimmerling  Francis 2016 Frick et al. 2017).;Migration of bats over the sea seems to be relatively predictable when viewed in context with specific weather parameters (Figure 7.4). Low wind speeds, low illumination by the moon, and dense cloud cover were the main predictors of bat occurrence at a remote North American island (Cryan  Brown 2007). In addition, most registrations of bats at an illuminated offshore research platform in the North Sea coincided with rain, fog, or low stratus (Hppop  Hill 2016). Since records of bats in this longterm study were generally lower than at comparable sites in the North Sea, that is, on the offshore island of Helgoland (Skiba 2007 O. Hppop, unpublished data), the authors concluded that a significant proportion of passing bats may not have been recorded because they flew at higher altitudes than detectable by the recording system (Hppop  Hill 2016). This assumption, in combination with the behaviour of the bats at the platform, as inferred from their recorded echolocating signal, implies that at least some bat species seem to be attracted by illuminated offshore installations for
