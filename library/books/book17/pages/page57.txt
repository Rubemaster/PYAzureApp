An international collaborative effort between academia, industry and regulation is required first to address the gaps in our baselineunderstanding and then to develop effective methods for quantifying the impacts of structures and operations on the marine environment. There are signs of progress in this area but further work, and the funding required to deliver it, is essential to understand the real impacts of offshore wind and replace reliance on models and precautionary estimates with real empirical data. If done effectively, this will achieve the twin aims of gaining a better understanding of the global marine environmental baseline and the subsequent development of suitably robust analytical techniques for assessment and monitoring environmental impacts. This will then facilitate standardisation of international approaches to assessment and regulation, thereby streamlining the consenting process and allowing the continued expansion of offshore wind without compromising our natural environment and resources.;The authors would like to thank the following friends and colleagues for contributing their thoughts and time to this chapter Piers Guy, Andy Paine, Kathy Wood, Mary Thorogood, Eva Philipp, Pietr van Zijl, Judith Jehee, Nicole Kadagies, Kazuaki Hosokawa, Ole Bigum Nielsen, Willem van Dongen, Sam Park, Hannah Hendron and Michael Chang.
