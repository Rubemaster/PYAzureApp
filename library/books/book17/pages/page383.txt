During the 1980s, a new outer harbour of Zeebrugge was constructed on the coast of Flanders, northern Belgium. Two main breakwaters were built and parts of the area betweenthem became very attractive for breeding seabirds, especially gulls and terns. As a result, colonies of international importance (1 of the biogeographic population) have existed since 1989 for Common Tern Sterna hirundo and since 1991 for Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis and Little Tern Sternula albifrons, although the last two species have shown strong fluctuations in population size.;Initially, most terns nested in the western port area. However, further industrialisation of this area and the extension of a tern peninsula along the eastern breakwater, specifically constructed as new breeding habitat, gradually displaced all the terns by 2004 towards the tern peninsula (Figure 9.2). Because of the breeding terns, parts of the harbour area became protected as a Natura 2000 site.;Figure 9.2 The previous and current location of turbines in relation to the tern colony on the eastern port breakwater in Zeebrugge, Belgium.;At that time, along the eastern breakwater, a row of 25 (mostly) 400 kW wind turbines was already present. As a result, during the breeding season many terns collided with the turbines as they undertook regular foraging flights to and from the sea, thereby crossing the row of turbines (Figure 9.3 and
