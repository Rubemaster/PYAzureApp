Scroby Sands offshore wind farm, comprising 30 2 MW Vesta V80 turbines, was installed by E.ON UK Renewables Offshore Wind Ltd adjacent to Scroby Sands, a dynamic sandbar system some 3 km offshore of Great Yarmouth, UK, in late 2003 and into 2004 (Figure 6.7). The site was the second to become operational in the UK. The main bank of Scroby Sands, some 2 km south of the wind farm, was emergent at low water and had been known to support one of the few colonies of Harbour Seals Phoca vitulina along the English east coast for over a century. In contrast, Grey Seals Halichoerus grypus only colonised the area in the late 1950s.;Figure 6.7 Seals hauled out on the main bank of Scroby Sands close to Scroby Sands offshore wind farm.
