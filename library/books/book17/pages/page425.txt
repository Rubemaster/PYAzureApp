The small footprint of turbines, coupled with their wide spacing (generally at least 600 m to 1 km or more), means that the amount of original habitat lost within a wind farm is generally very small, so that the potential for the original fauna present to be routinely displaced is low, even accepting changes in geomorphological conditions (Rees  Judd, Chapter 2) and ocean dynamics (Brostrm et al., Chapter 3). For the more mobile and larger fauna in particular, low levels of disturbance may not lead to any detectable changes in their distribution or abundance. For birds, low levels of disturbance may be expressed as changes in behaviour such as increased vigilance, short redistributing flights or dives of birds from the sea surface, or subtle deviations of birds in flight. At higher levels of disturbance, a change in temporal or spatial use may be exhibited by some species, thereby leading to avoidance and ultimately displacement from otherwise suitable habitat within or close to a wind farm.;Throughout the life of a wind farm, vessels provide a source of disturbance for seabirds and marine mammals. The prospect of disturbance, through both visual and audible cues, is likely to be at its zenith during construction, when many vessels of different types and sizes may be permanently present and active, albeit often within clusters of activity (see Jameson et al., Chapter 1). Even when the wind farm has been built, maintenance vessels generally make daily trips to the site.;However, no studies have managed to separate the effects of vessels from other activities such as noisy construction or the presence of the operational turbines, although vessels in isolation are known to be disruptive for some birds such as divers (Gavia spp.) and seaduck such as scoters (Melanitta spp.), which often flush
