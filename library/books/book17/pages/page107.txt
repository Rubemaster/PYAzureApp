Following on from Brostrm (2008), Ludewig (2013, 2015) considered a much broader and more realistic set of conditions and found that although the findings of Brostrm (2008) were realistic overall, they were, as to be expected, too simplified. Both the windwake and the ocean response are more complex in a realistic situation. Ludwigs study was based on simulations of a coupled atmosphereocean model, the Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM), forced with meteorological data from the three dimensional MEsoscale TRAnsport and Stream (METRAS) model. HAMSOM is a threedimensional baroclinic ocean model, which was developed for shelf seas. Simulations were performed in an idealised test box with a horizontal domain size of 240240 km2 using the assumption of four open boundaries. Moreover, a constant wind forcing with a geostrophic southwesterly wind of 8 ms was prescribed over 1 day. Owing to the limitations of this idealised case, tidal effects have been neglected. In agreement with the real conditions at Alpha Ventus (see Box 3.1), 12 wind turbines were placed in the centre of the model domain and the water depth was set uniformly to 30 m. The model resolution was set to 2.51.5 in the horizontal, approximating to 3 km, and 2 m in the vertical. For more details, see Ludewig (2013, 2015).;Beside these model simulations, some much needed observational evidence that the wind wake from a wind farm may produce upwelling and downwelling was derived from measurements conducted during cruise 141 with the research vessel VWFS Wega between 10 and 13 May 2013 around Alpha Ventus, where 39 conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) profiles were taken. The positions of the CTD profiles are shown in Figure 3.4.
