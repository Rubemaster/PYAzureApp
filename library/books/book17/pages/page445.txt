Figure 10.9 Flight lines of visually tracked (Perrow et al. 2011b) breeding Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis interacting with the navigation buoys installed around Sheringham Shoal offshore windfarm (OWF) in eastern England. A total of 15.7 (n424) of the 2,705 individuals tracked were recorded landing on or taking off from buoys, with n22 of these interacting with a buoy more than once in the same track. Insert Sandwich Terns in situ on a buoy. (Richard Berridge);Combining visual tracking and boatbased surveys, Harwood et al. (2017) concluded that buoys were being used as staging posts by birds on extended foraging trips farther offshore and that buoys were responsible for the increased use of the 02 km buffer area in which the buoys were situated, with a resultant effect on the use of the wind farm.;In the 2014 breeding season, an effort was made to regularly record Sandwich Tern numbers and activity at each buoy during the tracking period (n73 days). A total of n330 counts were made over the breeding season, incorporating the prebreeding, incubation, provisioning and postbreeding fledging periods. The southwest buoy was sampled most frequently (n58) (Table 10.2), in accordance with this being the closest buoy to the inception of most tracks of birds from the Blakeney Point colony on a southwest to northeast flightline (Figure 10.9). The east buoy was the most frequently utilised overall, with the highest mean counts in three of the four periods and the highest mean count overall of 17.8 birds observed in the prebreeding season. The highest single count of terns was 29, on the southeast buoy in mid July, with ten Harbour Porpoises Phocoena phocoena feeding nearby, suggesting that birds were aggregating near a profitable foraging patch. The overall mean count (1 SE) across the entire period and all buoys, was 5.730.37.
