This chapter aims to present a unifying synthesis of the effects and impacts of offshore wind farms upon the different trophic levels of marine life, from seabed communities and fish to marine mammals and seabirds, as well as migratory birds and birds passing over the sea, derived in the previous chapters in this volume. Most information originates from northwestern European waters, the current focus of offshore wind. The installation of turbines and scour protection affects local coastal processes and ocean dynamics, with potential for the windwake effect to generate upwelling over considerable areas, thereby affecting biological productivity. During construction, noisy pile driving may displace sensitive fish and marine mammals and some seabirds. Return may be rapid, although the fish prey base of a breeding seabird was affected in one case. After construction, rapid colonisation of hard surfaces by species such as Blue Mussels occurs. The reef effect, with aggregation of fish including large predators, thereby attracting marine mammals and some seabirds, is generally seen as positive. The displacement of seabirds from operational wind farms is species specific, with divers and Northern Gannet the most sensitive, and has implications for individual fitness. Collision of birds such as gulls is rarely recorded, although sampling such events is technically difficult. Further evidence is required to address concern regarding possible collision of migratory birds and bats. Cumulative effects have barely
