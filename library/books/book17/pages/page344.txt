Figure 8.8 Global Positioning System (GPS) tag with solar panel being fitted to a breeding European Herring Gull Larus argentatus. Rapid evolution of tag technology now allows a wide range of seabirds to be tagged, with the resulting data showing finescale details of the interaction of the individual birds with offshore wind farms. (Misjel Decleer, Flanders Marine InstituteVlaams Instituut voor de Zee);This analysis included nine studies that aimed to assess displacement of divers following the construction of an OWF, resulting in a mean displacement score of 1.4. Except at Robin Rigg, where the analyses were conducted at species level for Redthroated Diver Gavia stellata, divers were mostly analysed as a species group owing to relatively high percentages of birds that remain undetermined. On the other hand, the percentage of Redthroated Divers among positively determined divers was often very high, for example 98 at Kentish Flats, 93 at Alpha Ventus and 91 at Horns Rev 2. Conclusions drawn on the displacement of divers can therefore be expected to hold true for Redthroated Diver. Seven out of nine studies showed strong avoidance of OWFs by divers, six of which were supported by statistical significance, while the two
