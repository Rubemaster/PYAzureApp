 Nehls 2003 Hppop et al. 2006), whereas the flux over, for example, the Caribbean Islands is more equalised (Richardson 1976). Accurate projections of the numbers of passing migrants are difficult to make and depend considerably on the method of observation (Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5). For example, long term daytime migration counts at the offshore research platform FINO 1, situated in the North Sea about 45 km off the nearest coastal island (Hill et al. 2014a), provided estimates of approximately 140,000 birds, of which 15,000 were passerines, crossing the platform at an imaginary line of 620 km orthogonal to the northeastsouthwest main migration direction each year (Hill et al. 2014a). Likewise, Dierschke (2003) estimated from visual daytime observations that about 1 million migrating seabirds, waterfowl and waders passed the remote island of Helgoland each year in a radius of 510 km. Of course, visual observations cannot cover nocturnal migration, and Fijn et al. (2015) calculated total numbers from daytime and nighttime radar observations within an OWF about 1018 km off the Dutch coast. Their data suggest more than 3 million birds (echoes) passing the whole windfarm area of about 27 km2 annually.;The extent of bird migration over the sea is largely dependent on the ecological needs and, as for example in raptors (Kerlinger 1985 Malmiga et al. 2014 Agostini et al. 2015 Nourani  Yamaguchi 2017), on the morphology of the flight apparatus of the respective species or species group. Whereas seabirds commonly avoid flying over land as they depend on open water for foraging andor resting, songbirds, shorebirds and other terrestrial species mainly migrate along the coast as they are not able to rest at sea. At the German Bight of the North Sea, for example, littoral migration seems to be generally more pronounced than offshore migration (Hppop et al. 2006 2010). In contrast, over the Gulf of Mexico, steady wind currents may have shaped a relatively narrow band of intensive migration across the sea to arrive at a preferred stopover location at the northern Gulf of Mexico coast in spring (Gauthreaux et al. 2006 Cohen et al. 2017). At the Great Lakes in eastcentral North America, a great proportion of migratory birds crosses directly, but at some locations birds seem to avoid lake crossing (Diehl et al. 2003).
