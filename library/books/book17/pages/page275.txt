In sunny conditions, soaring raptors often gain height by uplift before crossing the sea in gliding flight, often well above rotor height. But when forced to cross open water in less favourable conditions with no uplift and adverse winds, they generally fly at a lower altitude (Berndt et al. 2005 Corso 2001 Germi 2005 Baisner et al. 2010 Malmiga et al. 2014). During poor weather such as fog, drizzle, rain, low air pressure, headwinds, and strong winds in general, flight altitudes as well as the overall numbers of birds at sea generally decrease (Gruber  Nehls 2003 Hppop et al. 2004 2006 Aumller et al. 2011 Kahlert et al. 2012). Flight heights also change with time of day, which may reflect temporal changes in intraspecific behaviour, such as in thrushes (Myres 1964) or the spectrum of species involved. Over the North and Baltic Seas, general median flight altitude as measured by radar is lowest during the day and highest at night, mostly in the first hours after sunset, which means soon after taking off (Myres 1964 Bourne 1980 Hppop et al. 2004 Kahlert et al. 2012). Flight altitude then decreases continuously throughout the night and briefly increases again around sunrise. Diehl et al. (2003) and Archibald et al. (2017) reported similar dawn ascents from the Great Lakes mirroring the experiences of Richardson (1978a) off eastern North America. At a site in the North Sea close to the Weser estuary where a nearshore wind farm was planned, Walter and Todeskino (2005) could not find any general differences in flight altitudes between daytime and nighttime by means of radar. Instead, they observed considerable variation in flight altitudes between days and seasons and discussed the possible influence of weather parameters. Overall, in their study, most birds flew below 500 m (up to 89) and even below 200 m (up to 61). In conclusion, many species or species groups generally fly in large numbers within or just below the rotorswept area of offshore wind turbines.;The main factors determining offshore bird migration are summarised schematically in Figure 7.4. All the factors shown can be influenced by background factors such as food availability at breeding, stopover or wintering sites, other weather parameters and the availability of adequate stopover habitats (Richardson 1978b 1990 Alerstam 1990 Cresswell 2014 Cooper et al. 2015 and many others).
