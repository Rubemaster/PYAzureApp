Figure 4.3 Artificial substratum in the North Sea providing new habitat for hardsubstratum fauna in the mainly sedentary benthic environment. (WG Ecosystem Functions, Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research);Several floral and faunal zones can hence be distinguished on windturbine foundations, from intertidal sessile taxa such as green, brown and red algae, barnacles (e.g. Semiblananus spp. and Balanus spp.) and Blue Mussels Mytilus edulis in northwestern Europe (Figure 4.4) and Mytilus galloprovincialis in the Mediterranean, to subtidal communities dominated by mobile crustaceans (amphipods, cumaceans and isopods) and anemones such as Metridium spp. (Kerckhof et al. 2010 Krone et al. 2013a de Mesel et al. 2015). Given these changes, the introduction of new and different habitat types leads to an increased local biodiversity, which is one of the most commonly reported changes due to OWFs (Gutow et al. 2014 Lindeboom et al. 2015). At the German wind farm Alpha Ventus, the abundance of macroinvertebrates was 100
