A total of 7,409 seal sightings were made, comprising 4,364 Harbour Seals (59), 2,735 Grey Seals (37) and 310 unidentified seals (4). The mean counts of Harbour Seals, including both adults and pups presumed to have been born onthe bank, and Grey Seals, in each monitoring year are shown in Figure 6.9. During modelling, Skeate et al. (2012) accounted for a number of environmental factors that could influence counts, including wind direction and speed and tidal height, as well as seasonal trends. Significant changes in seal numbers between years could not be explained by other factors. The decline in Harbour Seals during the year of construction without full recovery by the end of the monitoring period was reasoned to be induced by piling noise, but there was also a potential link to increased vessel traffic, to which hauledout Harbour Seals may be sensitive (Andersen et al. 2012 Jansen et al. 2015). In contrast, Grey Seals showed a continued yearonyear increase in numbers after construction, suggesting no effect of construction noise, although shortterm disturbance and displacement during the period of piling could not be discounted as monitoring was not specifically tied to discrete construction events. The increase in Grey Seals was linked with the wider success of the species in the area that also introduced the possibility of competition with Harbour Seals for resources, including space at the haulout, which may have contributed to the failure of Harbour Seals to recover their numbers. Recovery could also have been retarded by the prospect of Harbour Seals being displaced to other haulouts beyond their typical foraging range of up to 45 km, thereby reducing the prospect of an individual encountering and recolonising Scroby Sands (Thompson et al. 1996).
