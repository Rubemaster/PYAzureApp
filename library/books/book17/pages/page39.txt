 Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the NorthEast Atlantic (OSPAR). This convention came into force in 1992 and is the current legislation regulating international cooperation on environmental protection in the NorthEast Atlantic. It combines the 1972 Oslo Convention on dumping waste at sea and the 1974 Paris Convention on land based sources of marine pollution.  Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, otherwise known as the London Convention. This convention came into force in 1972 and defines an agreement to control pollution of the sea by dumping, and to encourage regional agreements supplementary to the convention, such as the Oslo Convention.;The European Union (EU) delivers the requirements of international conventions through a series of European Directives, including several that are key to the development of offshore wind, particularly in countries such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. As the majority of global offshore wind capacity has been installed within EU waters, it is the EU legislation that has framed the context within which offshore wind has been developed. For example; In the UK, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) 200142EC and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 201452EU Directives (as amended). SEA is the assessment of environmental consequences of public plans or programmes, whereas EIA is the assessment of public and private projects considered likely to have significant environmental impacts. Each EU member state has a different approach to the EIA screening process some will consider EIA necessary owing to the number of proposed turbines, while others will base the decision on the energy generation potential of the project.
