 Jacket. Jackets are latticelike structures of tubular steel, typically on four legs, each of which is fixed to the seabed using a pinpile (Figure 1.7). They are highly resistant to force and therefore well suited to deeper water and strong tides or currents. Jackets are generally a more expensive alternative to monopiles, although innovations in design using less steel, such as the twisted jacket, are making them more economical. The initial installation process for a jacket is similar to that of the monopile, using a jackup vessel and piledriving hammer however, the pin piles being used to pin the jacket foundation to the seabed are much smaller (around 1.22.6 m) than for a monopile and therefore require a smaller hammer size and reduced hammer energy. Once the pin piles have been secured into the seabed the jacket is lowered and secured on to the piles.;Figure 1.7 Jacket foundations ready for installation at Ormonde Offshore Wind Farm on the English west coast. (Ben Barden); Tripod. As the name suggests, tripods comprise three legs extending from a central column and fixed in place using pin piles. These extremely stable structures are well suited to deep
