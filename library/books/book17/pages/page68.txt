Figure 2.1 (a) Monopile foundations are by far the most common foundation installed (b) jacket latticetype foundations are better suited to deeper waters with strong tides or currents. (Martin Perrow);Gravitybase structures typically consist of a steel or concrete substructure which rests on the seabed. A wide variety of gravitybase and caissontype foundations have been either designed or installed. The main characteristics include a wide, typically 50 m diameter base made from concrete, typically 5 10 m high, with a tower extending to the surface. The design depends on the application, hydrodynamic regime, water depth (normally shallow to deep water 6070 m) and seabed characteristics. The installation of gravitybase structures may require the dredging of large volumes of material for seabed preparation to create a level and stable surface. Furthermore, the footprint of the gravitybase structure is large, which can cause a significant impact in terms of habitat loss. A 16 m diameter gravitybase foundation without scour protection will have a 200 m2 footprint on the seabed. Peire et al. (2009) describe the ground preparation and installation methods for gravitybase foundations as deployed at the Thornton Bank OWF in Belgium and as shown in Figure 2.2, as follows
