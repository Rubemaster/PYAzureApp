Significant research has been undertaken at Dutch OWFs to understand the impacts of offshore wind on the marine environment. In a similar vein to Alpha Ventus in German waters, research at the OWF Egmond aan Zee, built by Noordzeewind (ajoint venture of Nuon Duurzame Energie and Shell Wind Energy), aimed to evaluate the economic, technical, ecological and social effects of OWFs through the development of a site monitoring and evaluation programme. The site was constructed in the summer of 2006 and has been in operation since January 2007. Monitoring was again undertaken across a range of trophic levels from bivalves (Bergman 2010), to both demersal (Lambers  Hofstede 2009) and pelagic (Ybema et al. 2009) fish, with further special studies on Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua and Sole Solea vulgaris (Winter et al. 2010), as well as birds (Krijgsveld et al. 2011 Poot et al. 2011) and marine mammals (Brasseur et al. 2012 Scheidat et al. 2012). The general effects for all groups over the short term, with a focus on the operational phase, are summarised by Lindeboom et al. (2011).;China is rapidly becoming a major player in the offshore wind industry, having exceeded the installed capacity of a number of European countries in recent years (Figure 1.1). At the time of writing in 2017, China has the greatest offshore wind installed capacity of all nonEuropean countries (Global Wind Energy Council 2015) following the setting of ambitious targets by the government of 5 GW installed by 2015 and 30 GW by 2020 (Carbon Trust 2014a). However, achieving these targets has proved more difficult than anticipated, with only 1.6 GW installed by 2016. The main factors driving the slower pace of development were the lack of a complete local supply chain and the considerable investment and risk associated with developing offshore wind in a new market, which discouraged investors.;The consenting process is much faster in China than in many other nations, taking around 2 years to obtain the various permits required from government agencies. Under the Chinese EIA Law (1999), developers must conduct an EIA for construction projects that have a potential of having a significant environmental impact and submit an Environmental Impact Report to the State Environmental Protection Administration. In 2013, the National Energy Administration (NEA) devolved powers to provincial governments to try to accelerate consenting, although this had
