The proportion of terrestrial bird species and bats migrating over the sea is much higher than one might assume. Especially during autumn migration, remarkable numbers of birds and bats can be recorded offshore. Consequently, the rapid, worldwide advance of offshore wind power facilities may pose a significant threat to migrating birds and bats in terms of increased energy expenditure and higher collision risk. The extent and the behaviour of birds and bats at offshore wind farms (OWFs) are, however, dependent on a variety of intrinsic, environmental, site and speciesspecific conditions. During daytime and under good visibility as well as during clear nights, many bird species avoid entering OWFs, fly well above rotor height or fly between the turbine rows. Under these conditions, effects on flight energetics are mainly negligible and the risk of collision is generally low. In deteriorating weather situations, flight altitudes of birds at sea normally decrease and artificially lit structures may yield particular attraction. As a consequence, energy expenditure as well as collision risk may increase. Bats are observed to fly low over the sea but may also migrate at higher altitudes. However, some bats change their altitude rapidly when they approach tall vertical obstacles and, onshore, bats have been observed to feed near the turbine blades or to roost at the nacelles. Technical and logistical constraints associated with assessing actual numbers of bird and bat collisions with offshore wind turbines remain challenging. Consequently,
