Figure 10.1 Trends in the relative abundance (mean1 SE) of Harbour Porpoise Phocoena phocoena, Grey Seal Halichoerus grypus and Harbour Seal Phoca vitulina in boatbased surveys before (n40), during (n15) and after (n66) piling activity at Sheringham Shoal, UK. Note the decline in abundance of all species during piling relative to values before piling, with increases following the completion of piling. (Martin Perrow);The general response of seals to piling events, as exemplified by that observed at Sheringham Shoal (Figure 10.1), is characterised by shortterm aversion, rapid recovery and the subsequent increase in the use of operational sites, which seem to provide enhanced prey resources (see Colonisation and attraction, below). However, the
