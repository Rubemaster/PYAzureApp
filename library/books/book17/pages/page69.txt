Figure 2.2 Gravitybase foundation installation at Thornton Bank, Belgium. (Modified from Peire et al. 2009); The foundation pits are backfilled.  A twolayer scour protection system is installed around the gravity base.;Structures such as gravity caissons in the case of Nysted in Denmark (Danish Energy Authority 2006) have been installed in various conditions from relatively shallow water and low wavecurrent forcing to slightly deeper water, such as 20 m in the case of Thornton Bank, Belgium, and moderate wavetidal conditions (Peire et al. 2009). Structures tend to be large and heavy, reaching thousands of tonnes. Jacket foundations are typically three or foursided steel structures that are typically 30 m wide and 60 m high connected to the seabed using micropiles and with a tower extending to the surface.
