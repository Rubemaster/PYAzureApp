(Chapter 4) make the point that the sessile macrofaunal community typically colonising the foundations seems impoverished relative to that expected on natural hard substrata in similar oceanographic conditions, with dominance of a few species such as the tube building amphipod Jassa herdmani, anemones (Figure 10.6), hydroids Tubularia spp. and Blue Mussel Mytilus edulis, as well as a range of mobile species such as shrimps, hermit crabs and small fish (Figure 10.7).;Figure 10.6 Mobile fauna such as crabs benefit from the resources provided by colonising species, such as these anemones, favoured by the hard substrata of the windfarm structures.
