GEORG NEHLS, ANDREW J.P. HARWOOD and MARTIN R. PERROW;Marine mammals naturally occur in probably every offshore wind farm (OWF) worldwide. During construction, operation and decommissioning they are exposed to various pressures, of which the high levels of noise produced during pile driving of foundations into the seabed are the strongest, although other sources of noise including vessels may also have some effect. Noise may result in auditory effects with disturbance and resultant displacement, sound masking and even hearing loss, as well as nonauditory effects such as stress and physical injury. Other possible effects include the risk of collision with service vessels and changes to available habitats, including changes in hydrodynamics. Conversely, reef and refuge effects may actively benefit some species, owing to increases in prey associated with windfarm underwater structures or reduction in fishing pressure and disturbance. Studies have tended to focus on a limited range of more abundant species in European shelf seas, including Harbour Porpoise and Grey and Harbour Seals. However, given increases in the geographic extent of developments and potential for developments in deeper water, a greater range of species may become the focus of future studies. A number of studies have demonstrated disturbance and partial displacement of Harbour Porpoises up to distances of about 20 km during piledriving activities, which are reversible within 13 days. Operational wind farms are frequently used by Harbour Porpoise and both seal species and while some attraction has been shown for seals, overall
