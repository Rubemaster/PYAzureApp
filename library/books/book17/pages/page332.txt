Figure 8.5 Modelling results for Common Guillemot Uria aalge in the Bligh Bank study area (a) offshore wind farm (OWF) coefficients and their 95 confidence intervals (b) beforeafter controlimpact (BACI) density estimates for the month with maximum numbers.;This step in the displacement assessment process is the one displaying most variation, some of this variation being the result of rapidly evolving insights and statistical techniques. Whereas earlier reports use basic calculations andor statistical testing to look for evidence of displacement, most recent publications apply much more advanced statistical modelling techniques.;When based on visual observations, raw data are likely to be subject to imperfect detection. As distance to the subject increases, the chance of detection decreases according to a detection function (Buckland et al. 2001). To be able to model such a detection function, the distance to the recorded birds needs to be assessed while surveying, which appears to be common practice. Performing a distance analysis results in speciesspecific detection probabilities, which, in turn, can be used to correct the counted numbers for birds missed during surveying. Detection probabilities tend to be lower for small, darkcoloured birds such as auks (Figure 8.4) than for large species such as Northern Gannet and large Larus spp. gulls. The detection probability may further vary with observation conditions, which can also be included in the modelling process by applying a multicovariate distance analysis (Marques  Buckland 2003).
