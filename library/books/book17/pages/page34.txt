 Subsea export cables between offshore platforms andlandfall may be highvoltage alternating current (HVAC) or HVDC. HVAC remains most common but as wind farms increase in size and move farther offshore, HVDC technology becomes increasingly cost effective.  Onshore export cables are jointed directly to offshore export cables at landfall and then conduct electricity to the onshore substation.;Offshore cables may be laid directly on the seabed or buried using jetting, ploughing or trenching methods. Maintaining burial may be difficult because of the dynamic nature of the seabed. Therefore, additional measures may be used such as rock placement, concrete mattresses or ducting along sections with a higher risk of exposure. At landfall, subsea export cables are brought ashore for connection to onshore cables. This may involve trenching within the intertidal area or horizontal directional drilling underneath it (Figure 1.9). Subsea and onshore cables are then jointed together within an excavated bay typically set back from the landfall. Subsea cables are very large and expensive, and are designed specifically for subsea conditions. Therefore, it is advantageous to limit the total length required by jointing to onshore cables as close to landfall as possible.
