Even with specific knowledge of the literature and participation in meetings, I reached the conclusion some years ago (which is stillmaintained today) that it was difficult for an interested party to judge possible effects on wildlife, and especially the prospects of ecosystem effects generated by ecological interactions between affected habitats and their dependent species, or between species one or more of which could be affected by wind farms. In other words, there was a clear need for a coherent, overarching review of potential and actual effects of wind farms, and perhaps even more importantly, how impacts could be successfully avoided or mitigated. Understanding the tools available to conduct meaningful research is also clearly fundamental.;A meeting with Nigel Massen of Pelagic Publishing in late 2012 at the Chartered Institute of Ecology  Environmental Management Renewable Energy and Biodiversity Impacts conference in Cardiff, UK crystallised the notion of a current treatise and the opportunity to bring it to reality. Even then, the project could not have been undertaken without the significant financial support of ECON Ecological Consultancy Ltd. expressed as my time.;At the outset of the project I did not imagine the original concept (one volume for each of the onshore and offshore disciplines) would morph into a fourvolume series, with onshore and offshore each having a volume dedicated to (i) documenting current knowledge of the effects  the conflicts with wildlife and (ii) providing a stateofthescience guide to the available tools for monitoring and assessment, and the means of avoiding, minimising and mitigating potential impacts  the solutions. I also did not imagine that the gestation time to produce the volumes would be six years or so, or that the offshore volumes would run nearly two years behind the onshore volumes. The offshore industry has developed rapidly in the last few years, and this has meant many potential authors becoming swamped by their workloads within various roles within the industry. Perhaps inevitably, several authors fell by the wayside, and although replaced by others, this caused delays and some stop and start in the process. However, I believe this has meant that the books have benefited by being able to document the rapid progress in the last few years and now having a particularly active team of authors at the top of their game.
