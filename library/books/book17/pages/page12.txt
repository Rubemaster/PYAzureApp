Wind farms are seen as an essential component of global renewable energy policy and the action to limit the effects of climate change. There is, however, considerable concern over the effects of wind farms on wildlife, especially on birds and bats onshore, and seabirds and marine mammals offshore. On a positive note, there is increasing optimism that by operating as reefs and by limiting commercial fishing activity, offshore wind farms may become valuable in conservation terms, perhaps even as marine protected areas.;With respect to any negative effects, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) adopted in many countries should, in theory, reduce any impacts to an acceptable level. Although a wide range of monitoring and research studies have been undertaken, only a small body of that work appears to make it to the peerreviewed literature. The latter is burgeoning, however, concomitant with the interest in the interactions between wind energy and wildlife as expressed by the continuing Conference on Wind Energy and Wildlife Impacts (CWW) series of international conferences on the topic. In 2017, 342 participants from 29 countries attended CWW 2017 in Estoril similar to the numbers of both at Berlin CWW in 2015. There is also evidence of increasing interest within individual countries. For example, the Wind Energy and Wildlife seminar (Eolien et biodiversit) in ArtiguesprsBordeaux, France on 2122 November 2017, relating to both onshore and offshore wind, attracted over 400 participants.
