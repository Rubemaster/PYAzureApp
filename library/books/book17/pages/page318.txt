NICOLAS VANERMEN and ERIC W.M. STIENEN;The huge surface area assigned to current and future offshore wind farm (OWF) developments has raised concern over the impact of displacement and resultant habitat loss on seabird populations. The North and Baltic Seas host most of the worlds OWFs, and numerous local studies have aimed to assess displacement effects on a range of seabirds. Extensive literature review demonstrates that divers, Northern Gannet, Common Guillemot and Razorbill show relatively consistent avoidance of areas occupied by turbines, although not all studies could detect displacement of these species. Spatial variation in observed displacement levels may be due to multiple local factors such as habitat quality, prey distribution, windfarm configuration and location relative to the colony andor feeding grounds. At the other end of the spectrum, Great Cormorants and Great Black backed Gulls appear to be attracted to OWFs, where both species favour roosting on the foundations of the outermost turbines. Common Eider was the only species to show consistently indifferent behaviour among the available studies. Lastly, the response of a number of species, mainly gulls, was found to be inconsistent. Importantly, the ecological consequences of the observed changes in distribution remain poorly understood. Species avoiding wind farms are expected to expend more energy to find alternative habitat, where they may face increased competition with conspecifics, in turn affecting food intake rates. Otherwise, birds attracted to wind farms are likely to be subject to increased collision risk and additional mortality. A quantitative translation of these effects into
