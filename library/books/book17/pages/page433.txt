Figure 10.3 Generalised additive mixed model predictions with associated 95 confidence intervals of Razorbill Alca torda abundance in relation to (a) the sitebuffers (beforeafter gradient) comparison and (b) the sitecontrol (beforeafter controlimpact) comparison. The monitoring years in both cases are 1, 200910 2, 201011 3, 201112 4, 201213 and 5, 201314.
