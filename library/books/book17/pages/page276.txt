Although the first experiments to mark individual bats started in the early 19th century in both North America and Europe (Allen 1921 Eisentraut 1934 Hutterer et al. 2015), many facts about bat migration remain largely unknown and systematic offshore studies (Cryan  Brown 2007 Ahln et al. 2009 Bach et al. 2009 Frey et al. 2012 Lagerveld et al. 2014 Rydell et al. 2014 Fritzn 2015 Hppop  Hill 2016 Peterson et al. 2016) are rare. Whereas birds need to feed regularly at their stopover and wintering sites, some bat species hibernate and thus can spend the winter in areas without access to food (Fleming  Eby 2003 Hutterer et al. 2005). Accordingly, migration distances rarely exceed 100 km (Hutterer et al. 2005). Nevertheless, at least six European (Fleming  Eby 2003 Hutterer et al. 2005) and three North American (Cryan 2003 Hatch et al. 2013) bat species are known to migrate distances up to 4,000 km. Numbers of migrating bats are less well known than numbers of migrating birds but, for example, more than 20 million Mexican Freetailed Bats Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana change from their maternity roosts in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico to their wintering sites farther south in Mexico (Wiederholt et al. 2013). In the Netherlands, probably 50,000100,000 Nathusius Pipistrelles Pipistrellus nathusii migrate in autumn (Lina  Reinhold 1997).;The main migration periods of bats in the northern hemisphere are from April to June and from late July to October (Cryan 2003 Hutterer et al. 2005 Rydell et al. 2014 Peterson et al. 2016). Within Europe, the main migratory direction is from northeast to south west or south from summer to winter, respectively (Hutterer et al. 2005), whereas in North America, movements broadly occur along the northsouth axis and tend to be variable on a speciesspecific andor populationspecific level (Cryan 2003 Cryan et al. 2014b Peterson et al. 2016).;Our general awareness of regular movements of bats over sea has long been hindered by their nocturnality. The first evidence of bat migration off the coasts of Europe goes back to von Dalla Torre (1889), who mentioned the occurrence of numerous bats on the island of Helgoland during migration times. Early published records of North American bats at sea in the Atlantic include reports not
