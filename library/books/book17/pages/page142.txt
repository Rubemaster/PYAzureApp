2006 Kaiser  Pulsipher 2005). As an example, in the northeast Atlantic, Recommendation 983 of the Oslo and Paris Convention (OSPAR) requires that Member States remove the upper structures such as the turbine towers (monopiles), or at least ensure that there is 55 m clearance to allow navigation, whereas the seabed structures can be left in place with the permission and agreement of the national regulatory bodies.;Analogous to structures such as oil and gas rigs, the installation of a wind farm induces changes to the local ecology and environment, eventually reaching a new equilibrium. Studies on physical disturbance in the marine environment, such as laying of pipelines, aspects of construction and beddredging activities, have concluded that even after such disturbances have ceased, many marine systems do not revert to the prestressor state (Elliott et al. 2007 Mazik  Smyth 2013 Duarte et al. 2015). Hence, it is arguable whether there would be a return to the preconstruction state following full decommissioning of a wind farm. For instance, in sandy sediments, upon which many of the earliest wind farms were built, scour can be as deep as 1.38 times the monopile diameter (Whitehouse et al. 2011) and so an extensive amount of scour protection may have been installed to protect the foundations. Hence, its removal is likely to generate adverse change to the new ecological equilibrium that has developed over the 2030 years of operation.;The approach of leaving in place an artificial reef, with benefits for commercial and recreational fishing plus the reduced costs for developers, needs to be weighed against operational challenges of leaving parts in place, where these challenges relate to safety of navigation, ongoing maintenance costs, issues in relation to liability of the reef and potential for the spread of nonindigenous species. This would need to be assessed on a sitespecific basis with all of these factors being considered (Smyth et al. 2015).
