A few birds from the high American Arctic are also part of the huge East Atlantic flyway but most North American bird species utilise a system of three different American flyways, again in huge numbers. Some will avoid following the Central American land bridge and instead directly cross the open Gulf of Mexico (Atlantic American flyway, light blue in Figure 7.1). The East Asian Australasian flyway encompasses large parts of East Asia and extends from Arctic Russia and North America to the southern limits of Australia and New Zealand (yellow in Figure 7.1), with over 50 million migratory waterbirds, including 8 million waders. Hugenumbers of passerine and nearpasserine migrants use this flyway too, many travelling to southeast Asia from breeding grounds in eastern and central Siberia (BirdLife International 2010).;Many migrating birds and bats almost inevitably meet anthropogenic offshore structures such as wind farms or oil and gas producing platforms at least twice a year, especially in the North and Baltic Seas or in the Gulf of Mexico. The dimension of worldwide offshore wind energy development raises several concerns over its effects upon wildlife. Nearly 88 (12,631 MW or 12.6 GW) of the worldwide offshore wind capacity is installed in waters off the European coasts (GWEC 2017). Overall, in 2016, there were 81 European offshore wind farms (OWFs) consisting of 3,589 turbines in ten northwest European countries. Installations in the North Sea account for 72 of all offshore wind capacity in Europe (GWEC 2017). The remaining 12 of the global offshore wind installations are located mainly off the coasts of China, Japan, and South Korea (GWEC 2017).;Governments of other countries are also setting ambitious targets for offshore wind power development. For example, beyond the first Rhode Island OWF which consists of five turbines and became operational in 2016, there are currently 17 projects off the Atlantic, Pacific and Great Lakes coasts in the USA under various stages of development (AWEA 2017 GWEC 2017). Worldwide, the trend is moving towards larger areas and increasingly taller and more powerful wind turbines, resulting in an increase of OWFs in both the horizontal and vertical scales. For example, the average rotor diameter of offshore wind turbines is expected to rise from currently slightly over 105 m in 2017 to around 125 m in the early 2020s with a simultaneous increase in power from an average of 6 to 12 MW (Deign 2018). Individual turbine types will soon reach a height of 260 m and a rotor diameter of 220 m, with a rotor swept area equivalent to 38,000 m or seven American football fields (GE 2018). There are presently no foreseeable limits on development.
