This chapter focuses on experiences from the northwest European continental shelf, where the first rounds of OWFs have been concentrated. Specifically, experiences from the UK are explored, where the first wind farms in 1030 m water depth were installedin regions with moderate to highmagnitude wave and tidal exposure. Results have been extracted from the peerreviewed literature, grey literature, indepth review of Environmental Impact Statements and review of Monitoring Reports from licence conditions. These have been synthesised into national reports for the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the NorthEast Atlantic (OSPAR) and other international reporting mechanisms (OSPAR Commission 2008). Since the early 2000s, the design of structures, installation techniques and mitigation methodologies have advanced significantly from simple monopiles in shallow water (1020 m) with postinstallation scour protection, such as at Scroby Sands OWF, to complex jacket structures in relatively deep water (3050 m) at the East Anglia One OWF. In parallel, understanding of the scale of the impacts on coastal processes has also improved, with targeted licence conditions and research programmes funded by the UK Government, The Crown Estate and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).;Changes to hydrodynamic and coastal processes resulting from OWFs include any change in water flow around the devices, any influence on the seabed sediments, such as scouring and suspension of seabed sediments into the water column, any influence on sediment transport patterns and any influence that devices may have on coastlines. The last factor also includes changes to hydrodynamic conditions such as tidal flow, tidal height and wave heights that may have an effect on either pelagic or benthic habitats, or both.;The most common foundation type is the monopile, but with increasing numbers of jacketstyle foundations in deeper waters (Box 2.1). There is a reasonable body of evidence of the effects associated with these structures on coastal processes and the effects of related scour protection and cabling and cable protection. The Themes section discusses the impacts of OWF structures on the key physical processes on the continental shelf before describing the use of chemicals in the OWF sector and exploring mitigation methods.
