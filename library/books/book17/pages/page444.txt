The visual tracking method established by Perrow et al. (2011b) was used to investigate the response of breeding Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis to the construction and operation of Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm (Greater Wash in Eastern England) from April to July from 2009 to 2015 inclusive. Sheringham Shoal is 19.5 km at its closest point from the Blakeney Point colony within the North Norfolk Coast Special Protection Area. Visual tracking involves followingindividual birds in a highspeed rigidhulled inflatable boat, mirroring the birds track and recording all behaviours.;Of the 2,705 birds tracked, a moderate proportion (15.7) interacted with the eight navigation buoys distributed around the perimeter of the wind farm. Interactions included beginning the track from a buoy or the track was interrupted or ended as the bird landed on the buoy for a variable amount of time (Figure 10.9). Observations showed buoys were being used for resting and roosting (perhaps even overnight) and as a platform for social behaviours, including a full range of courtship displays such as posturing, food presentation and passing, as well as copulation. Preening and washing were frequently observed on and around buoys, and ten birds were found roosting on the water near the northwest buoy on one occasion. Food passes were also observed on the sea surface around marker buoys and display flights in the vicinity of buoys were commonplace in the prebreeding season.;Figure 10.9 Flight lines of visually tracked (Perrow et al. 2011b) breeding Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis interacting with the navigation buoys installed around Sheringham Shoal offshore wind
