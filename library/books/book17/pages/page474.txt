Significant plans are now also in place in numerous other countries in the world for rapid expansion of wind farms, in their surrounding seas with different trophic conditions and a different set of dependent wildlife (Jameson et al., Chapter 1). The lessons learned from northwestern Europe must be incorporated into planning, using the monitoring and modelling tools and potential mitigation strategies outlined in Volume 4 of this series. However, until further research fills the knowledge gaps, the uncertainty of impacts should be embraced by avoiding conflict through careful selection of sites and even turbine locations bearing in mind that some turbines typically have greater impact than others (Perrow 2017). This will be vital to achieve Kiesecker et al.s (2011) visionof a winwin for wind energy and wildlife.;I am indebted to all the other 27 chapter authors and 3 additional box authors for their knowledge and hard work in preparing their chapters. The considered comments of Nicolas Vanermen of INBO on two earlier drafts of this manuscript are also greatly appreciated. I am deeply grateful to SCIRA Offshore Energy for funding the (as yet) unpublished work in relation to Sheringham Shoal, excerpts of which are presented here, and to E.ON for funding the previously published work in relation to Scroby Sands. Andrew Harwood kindly redrew Figure 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.10 and 10.11, as well as co authoring Box 10.2 with Richard Berridge, both of ECON Ecological Consultancy Ltd. Philip Pearson and Daniel Hercock of the RSPB kindly provided data gathered by RSPB staff and volunteers on recent counts of terns in Box 10.3.;4C Offshore (2018) Events of Cirrus Shell Flat Array.
