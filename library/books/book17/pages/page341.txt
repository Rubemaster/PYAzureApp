As Great Cormorants need to dry their feathers in between foraging bouts, the presence of abovewater constructions is a critical precondition to their being able to forage offshore for longer periods. As such, birds are now present in areas that were previously inaccessible, often resulting in very distinct increases and distributional concentrations (Leopold et al. 2013). At the Thornton Bank OWF, the majority of Great Cormorants was observed roosting on the turbine foundations (89), with a clear preference for outer rather than inner turbines. Great Blackbacked Gulls, by foraging on the wing and resting on the sea surfacewithout waterlogging, do not suffer from the same ecological restriction as Great Cormorants. Nevertheless, they did show a strongly comparable preference for the foundations at Thornton Bank, with 79 of the birds observed roosting on turbine foundations and concentrating along the windfarm edge (Figure 8.7). During operation of the Horns Rev OWF, all records of resting or perching cormorants and 91 of the gull records were made on turbines at the edge of the wind farm (Petersen et al. 2006). Apart from increased roosting possibilities, both species may also be attracted to OWFs because of improved food availability resulting from the attraction of fish to the turbine foundations andor the exclusion of commercial fishing and, at least in the case of Great Blackbacked Gull, possibly also because of benthic communities colonising the intertidal zones of the foundations (Leonhard  Pedersen 2006 Leonhard et al. 2011 Leopold et al. 2013 De Mesel et al. 2014 Reubens et al. 2014). Whatever the incentive, a concentration of birds staging at outer turbines points towards a collision of the opposing forces of avoidance and attraction along the edge of the wind farm.
