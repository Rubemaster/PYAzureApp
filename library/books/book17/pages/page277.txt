Our general awareness of regular movements of bats over sea has long been hindered by their nocturnality. The first evidence of bat migration off the coasts of Europe goes back to von Dalla Torre (1889), who mentioned the occurrence of numerous bats on the island of Helgoland during migration times. Early published records of North American bats at sea in the Atlantic include reports notonly of single bats, but also of flocks of up to 200 individuals passing by (e.g. Nichols 1920 Norton 1930 Thomas 1921 Allen 1923 Griffin 1940 Carter 1950). These, and numerous later records of bats from platforms, ships and remote islands (e.g. Cryan  Brown 2007 Skiba 2007 Ahln et al. 2009 Pelletier et al. 2013 Lagerveld et al. 2014 Petersen et al. 2014 Fritzn 2015 Hppop  Hill 2016 Peterson et al. 2016), render it highly unlikely that all movements can be explained by vagrancy or wind drift alone, as is often assumed.;Bats crossing large bodies of open water have been recorded over the North Sea (Skiba 2007 Lagerveld et al. 2014 Petersen et al. 2014 Hppop  Hill 2016), Baltic Sea (Ahln et al. 2009 Rydell et al. 2014 Fritzn 2015), the Mediterranean Sea (Amengual et al. 2007 Pereira et al. 2009) and the Atlantic Ocean (Hatch et al. 2013 Pelletier et al. 2013 Petersen et al. 2014 Peterson et al. 2016), as well as off the Pacific coast (Cryan  Brown 2007 Pelletier et. al. 2013). A satellitetracked Black Flyingfox Pteropus alecto flew from Papua New Guinea to west Australia and back, crossing 150 km of open sea (Breed et al. 2010). Also, several Large Flyingfoxes Pteropus vampyrus were recorded crossing the Straits of Malacca (around 50 km of open sea) between Malaysia and Sumatra (Epstein et al. 2009). Nonetheless, bat migration presumably concentrates along the coastlines (uba et al. 2012 Rydell et al. 2014). Migrating bats sometimes accumulate in large numbers at stopovers on peninsulas or islands before they embark on open sea crossings (Ahln et al. 2009 Rydell et al. 2014), where one can expect large numbers and hence a higher risk of collision with anthropogenic structures. Radio telemetry revealed that during autumn migration, half of the tagged Silverhaired Bats Lasionycteris noctivagans departed from Long Point across Lake Erie (minimum crossing distance 38 km) while half departed along the shoreline (McGuire et al. 2012). Conversely, Hatch (2015) observed that Silverhaired Bats and Eastern Red Bats Lasiurus borealis travel east to west along the Lake Erie shoreline as opposed to flying longer distances over open water.
