Habitats Directive, Council Directive 9243EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. All cetaceans are listed in Annex IV(a) of the Habitats Directive (EU 1992) and as such all Member States are required to establish a system of strict protection under Article 12(1). Bottlenose Dolphin Tursiops truncatus, Harbour Porpoise Phocoena phocoena, Harbour (or Common) Seal Phoca vitulina and Grey Seal Halichoerus grypus are also included as Annex II species requiring the designation of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). With respect to offshore wind farms, Article 12 of the Habitats Directive is of special importance as it prohibits (a) all forms of deliberate capture or killing of specimens of these species in the wild and (b) deliberate disturbance of these species, particularly during the period of breeding, rearing, hibernation and migration. In the context of the directive, the term killing includes injury which might impair survival and is thus relevant in relation to noise immissions and hearing impairment of cetaceans. The Habitats Directive further requires Member States to conduct appropriate assessments of any project, which may affect protected areas of the Natura 2000 network.;Cetaceans further receive international protection under Appendix II or III of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention 1979). Sixteen species of cetacean are also protected under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn or CMS Convention 1979, which came into force in 1985).;The international Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans in the Baltic and North Seas 1992 (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic area 2001 (ACCOBAMS) provide further protection under the auspices of the Bonn Convention. The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the NorthEast Atlantic (OSPAR) has also prescribed a series of programmes of Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQOs), such as a project aimed at reducing by catch of Harbour Porpoises to below 1.7 of the best
