(Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Pettersson 2005 Petersen et al. 2006). In the UK, early studies included fundamental research into the potential effect of wind farms on the distribution of Common Scoter Melanitta nigra, governed through their habitat preferences and bivalve mollusc prey resource (Kaiser et al. 2006), and the interactions of breeding Little Tern Sternula albifrons and their prey with Scroby Sands wind farm (Perrow et al. 2006 2011a). Scroby Sands also saw the first impact study on seals in the UK (Skeate et al. 2012), mirroring earlier studies in Denmark (Teilmann et al. 2006). In European waters, the potential for construction noise to have farreaching impacts upon cetaceans then became the focus of research (Tougaard et al. 2009 Thompson et al. 2010 Scheidat et al. 2011).;Technical challenges shape the nature of the data gathered, and the offshore wind industry has been obliged to be at the cutting edge in order to develop appropriate and meaningful survey, assessment and monitoring methods. Digital (camera) aerial (aeroplane) surveys for birds (and marine mammals) have replaced visual surveys (Buckland et al. 2012 Webb  Nehls, Volume 4, Chapter 3), and sophisticated techniques such as radar, thermal devices, video and integrated systems have been implemented to monitor collisions passively (Desholm et al. 2006 BMU  BSH 2014 Skov et al. 2018 Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5). In theory, this removes the need for intense human effort under challenging conditions, as illustrated by Pettersson (2005), who lived in the Utgrunden lighthouse to monitor the response of migrating waterfowl. Nonetheless, the data produced by remote techniques still generally demand human verification and analysis.
