2002) and four postconstruction years (20032007, except for 2006). In each of the seven years, three or four aerial surveys were conducted between January and early April along 26 northsouthoriented transects at 2 km intervals. The authors goal was to model finescale abundance patterns of Longtailed Ducks Clangula hyemalis (Figure 8.1) over time in relation to the construction of the wind farm, in a way that reflected environmental heterogeneity in the study area and accounted for important sources of uncertainty.;Figure 8.1 Male Longtailed Duck Clangula hyemalis in summer plumage. The Baltic Sea is an important wintering area, with around 1.5 million individuals in 20072009, representing a decline of around 65 compared to an earlier census in 19881993 (HELCOM 2017). The area around Nysted wind farm supports a relatively low density at less than five individuals per km2. (Joris Everaert);Using all survey data available, a multicovariate distance analysis was performed to correct the counted numbers of Longtailed Ducks for varying detectability. Based on the Akaike information criterion, survey, sea state, behaviour, group size and observer were all selected as covariates to model the detection function. This detection model was then used to estimate the number of seaducks present in each
