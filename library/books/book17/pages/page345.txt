This analysis included nine studies that aimed to assess displacement of divers following the construction of an OWF, resulting in a mean displacement score of 1.4. Except at Robin Rigg, where the analyses were conducted at species level for Redthroated Diver Gavia stellata, divers were mostly analysed as a species group owing to relatively high percentages of birds that remain undetermined. On the other hand, the percentage of Redthroated Divers among positively determined divers was often very high, for example 98 at Kentish Flats, 93 at Alpha Ventus and 91 at Horns Rev 2. Conclusions drawn on the displacement of divers can therefore be expected to hold true for Redthroated Diver. Seven out of nine studies showed strong avoidance of OWFs by divers, six of which were supported by statistical significance, while the tworemaining studies could not find convincing signs of displacement. The change in diver abundance was often found to be strong, with reductions in numbers of 67 at Egmond aan Zee (OWEZ), 73 at Thanet, 94 at Kentish Flats and 90 at Alpha Ventus (Leopold et al. 2013 Percival 2013 2014 Welcker  Nehls 2016).;Northern Gannets too seem to be sensitive to displacement by OWFs, with a mean score of 1.6 from the results of nine post construction monitoring studies (Figure 8.9). Six studies reported strong avoidance, with five of these showing a significant change or effect, compared to one reporting moderate avoidance and two without apparent adverse effect. Where detected, displacement seemed to be strong, with reductions of 93 at PAWP, 74 at OWEZ, 95 at Greater Gabbard, 79 at Alpha Ventus, 82 at Bligh Bank and 97 at Thornton Bank (Leopold et al. 2013 APEM 2014 Welcker  Nehls 2016 Vanermen et al. 2016 2017).;Figure 8.9 A number of studies show that Northern Gannets Morus bassanus are displaced from offshore wind farms, at least in the autumn winter months. Whether this pattern persists for breeding birds provisioning chicks will be tested with new wind farms planned relatively close to colonies in the UK. (Koen de Vos)
