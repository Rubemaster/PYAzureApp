A last important knowledge gap is the relationship between adult body mass and expected survival over the remainder of the year, which would help to quantify aforementioned carryover effects. Accordingly, there is no empirical information on the effectof fledging chick mass on postfledging survival (Searle et al. 2014).;While this theme has focused on the possible ecological impact of avoidance responses, it is important to note that seabird species that are attracted to OWFs will face increased collision risk. Whether resulting from displacement or collision, being long lived and late maturing, seabirds are highly sensitive to additional levels of adult mortality (Croxall  Rothery 1991 Sther  Bakke 2000), highlighting the need to keep working towards a reliable impact assessment framework in the light of future largescale OWF developments.;While a single OWF generally affects only small numbers of birds relative to their population sizes, the cumulative impact of all current and future developments may be severe and potentially even greater than the sum of single windfarm impacts (Masden et al. 2010a). As set out above (see Spatiotemporal variation in observed displacement effects and Ecological consequences), displacement affecting birds during the nonbreeding season at a location several thousands of kilometres away from the colony may have fitness consequences that only become apparent a few months later during the breeding season or even in the years thereafter. Ideally, a cumulative impact assessment would therefore include all existing and new windfarm developments within the yearround distribution range of the species or population under study. In practice, however, cumulative impact assessments are generally performed on smaller geographic scales coinciding with legislative units, for example to assess the impact of multiple windfarm developments on bird populations within Special Protection Areas (SPAs) or national boundaries.;Given their strong displacement response and high conservation status, several cumulative impact assessments have been performed for wintering Redthroated Divers. Garthe and Mendel (2010) calculated that displacement by all current and proposed OWFs in German North Sea waters would affect 1,450 individuals. As OWFs and shipping exclude each other in marine spatial planning, disturbance by shipping traffic is expected to affect another 2,700
