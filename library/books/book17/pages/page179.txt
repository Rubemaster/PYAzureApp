Knowledge on the association between fish and wind turbines is slowly growing and highlights that fish are attracted to the structures (Figure 5.6), which leads to questions about how ubiquitous this association is for each marine wind turbine or wind farm and whether there are differences over time. The general grouping of fish and their position in the water column, such as pelagic and demersal species, and how trophic and predatorprey interactions may change in an area as a result of the installation of an OWF, are shown in Figure 5.5. Several benthic (bottomdwelling)species, namely the European Eel, sculpins (Cottidae), and typical reefassociated species such as Goldsinny Wrasse Ctenolabrus rupestris, Eelpout Zoarces viviparous and Lumpsucker Cyclopterus lumpus, have been recorded in higher densities around turbines than in the surrounding waters and seabed in European waters (Wilhelmsson et al. 2006 Couperus et al. 2010 Bergstrm et al. 2013). A metaanalysis focusing on demersal and relatively stationary fish suggested that often only a few benthic and semi pelagic hardbottom associated species display large increases in local numbers, while densities of some softsediment associated species commonly remain unchanged or decrease (Ashley et al. 2014). However, more mobile pelagic species such as Horse Mackerel Trachurus trachurus, and demersal fish including Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua (Figure 5.7) and Pouting Trisopterus luscus have been recorded in large shoals closely associated with wind turbines (Couperus et al. 2010 Bergstrm et al. 2013). Catch rates of Pouting were noted as being nine to 100 times higher around wind turbines compared with surrounding sandy bottoms in a study by Reubens et al. (2013a).;Figure 5.6 Underwater images showing large numbers of fish around wind turbine towers in Swedish waters. (Dan Wilhelmsson)
