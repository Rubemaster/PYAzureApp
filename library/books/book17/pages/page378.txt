In the southern hemisphere, where petrels and shearwaters nest in high numbers near coastal wind farms, they have regularly been recorded as collision victims (Hull et al. 2013 Bull et al. 2013). Fatalities have included Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus, Fairy Prion Pachyptila turtur, Sooty Shearwater Ardenna grisea, Shorttailed Shearwater Ardenna tenuirostris, Common Diving Petrel Pelecanoides urinatrix, Whitefaced Storm Petrel Pelagodroma marina and Wilsons Storm Petrel Oceanites oceanicus. Although pelagic species such as petrels and shearwaters have not been recorded as fatalities at coastal wind farms in northern Europe and the USA, this is most likely because their ranges are rarely likely to overlap with terrestrial wind farms.;Evidence of collision avoidance is potentially easier to record than collision itself as events should, according to theory, be more frequent. However, avoidance may occur at a range of scales. These were initially defined by Cook et al. (2014) with modifications added by Skov et al. (2018) as (1) macroavoidance, involving total avoidance of the windfarm footprint and in some cases a buffer around its perimeter of up to 3 km (2) mesoavoidance, describing any within windfarm responses to the turbines, such as flying between rows, sometimes with a specific buffer around the rotor swept zone e.g. 10 m and (3) microavoidance, being a last minute action to avoid collision with the blades within any defined buffer. An overall avoidance rate would combine all these factors.;Where seabirds avoid wind farms during both construction and operation they cannot collide with the infrastructure. Studies in the Dutch North Sea estimated that 28 of all birds avoided the wind farm entirely (Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Petersen et al. 2006). Vanermen and Stienen discuss avoidance and displacement from the
