To help structure the Themes of this chapter, the information provided in each chapter on the six groups considered in this volume, namely seabed communities, fish, marine mammals, bats, migratory nonseabirds and seabirds, was summarised according to the evidence for effects and impacts (Table 10.1). As in the equivalent chapter in the onshore Volume 1 (Perrow 2017), the Themes classified the main effects across faunal groups under the following headings Disturbance and displacement, Colonisation and attraction, and Collision with turbines. In addition, it was important to consider Foodweb and indirect effects under a specific heading, because these invariably occur to a greater or lesser extent asoffshore wind farms alter physical processes and ocean dynamics, and as communities and ecological functioning change following the installation of new hard substrates available for colonisation. The evidence for Incombination and cumulative effects, as the sum of the effects from different factors and wind farms, and Population scale impacts, as the sum of effects upon individuals from all factors and sites within the range of a species population, was then summarised.;Table 10.1 Summary information on how the different faunal groups have been treated and studied in relation to wind farms, and the main effects and impacts that have been revealed.
