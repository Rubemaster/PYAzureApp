Figure 5.11 Platform diagram and map of the study area. The platform midwater habitat encompasses the hard substrate of the platform structure from the water surface to 2 m above the seafloor, whereas the platform base habitat is the bottom 2 m of the platform structure. The platform structure consists of outer vertical pilings and horizontal crossbeams as the platform jacket, with the vertical oil and gas conductors in the centre. Note that this is a general display diagram and the designs of these structures vary from platform to platform. The 16 platforms (filled circles names in all capital letters) and seven natural reefs (open circles) used in the study were surveyed for at least 5 and up to 15 years between 1995 and 2011.
