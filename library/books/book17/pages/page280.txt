American (ac) and European coasts (dh). Data in (a)(c) are from a long term automated recording survey at 31 study sites in North America 441.6 km from the nearest coast and at seven coastal sites in 20092014 (Peterson et al. 2016). Data in (d) stem from autonomous recordings at two wind farms 1523 km from the Dutch North Sea coast in 2012 (Lagerveld et al. 2014). Data in (e) stem from longterm autonomous acoustic recordings at the research platform FINO 1 in the German Bight, 45 km from the nearest coast, in 20042015 (Hppop  Hill 2016). Data in (f) stem from systematic observations of bats over the sea in resund, Kattegat and the southern Baltic Sea, at distances of 11.819.1 km from the nearest coast, in 2005, 2006 and 2008 (Ahln et al. 2009). Data in (g) and (h) stem from autonomous recordings in the German Baltic Sea in 2012 at the working platform Riff Rosenort, 2.2 km from coast (g), and at the island Greifswalder Oie, about 10 km from the coast (Seebens et al. 2013).;Figure 7.6 A surprisingly broad spectrum of bats has been detected offshore, including (a) Hoary Bat Lasiurus cinereus in the coastal North Atlantic and (b) Particoloured Bat Vespertilio murinus in the Baltic Sea. (a) Jens Rydell (b) Stefan Weiel;Despite the distance from the mainland, the intensity of bat migration over the sea seems to be highly dependent on low or moderate wind speeds (Cryan  Brown 2007 Ahln et al. 2009 Lagerveld et al. 2014 Hppop  Hill 2016 Peterson et al. 2016). Dense cloud cover seems to be an important predictor of bat occurrence offshore, such as at a remote island (Cryan  Brown 2007) or an isolated offshore platform (Hppop  Hill 2016). The influence of precipitation, fog, and air pressure on bat occurrence at sea is somewhat unclear or at least site specific. Departures of radiotagged migratory tree bats close to Lake Erie were more likely to occur on nights with higher barometric pressure, lower wind
