Within the various designs of OWFs, chemicals are used for a variety of purposes in the turbine and foundation pieces as well as offshore substations (Table 2.1). Also included are chemicals usedduring construction by jackup vessels, cable layers and crew transfer vessels, and during operation and maintenance activities, with decommissioning activities being envisioned as tending to be the reverse of construction. To the best of the authors knowledge, only two OWFs have been decommissioned to date (2017), the earliest OWF built at Vindeby in Danish waters and the Swedish site at Yttre Stengrund. Two turbines have also been removed at Robin Rigg OWF on the west coast of the UK. The various designs of structures used by the OWF sector involve the use of chemicals in open and closed systems. Open systems can vent into the open sea, including biocides from open piles via Jtubes, whereas chemicals such as fuels are retained within closed systems.;Chemical contamination relates to the potential unlicensed release of chemicals into the marine, terrestrial or atmospheric environment. The likelihood of release and potential for mitigation are provided in Table 2.2. Note that drill tailings arising from the insertion of a monopile can be licensed for release at authorised disposal sites based on an EIA. Contamination effects are possible during the construction phase of OWFs, such as from accidental pollution incidents. At the time of writing, only two types of such incidents associated with OWF construction have been reported in the OSPAR maritime area, suggesting that such events are rare. The
