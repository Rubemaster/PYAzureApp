It is first important to note that any discussion of population impacts is invariably hampered by the difficulty of defining the population adequately. Onshore, the National Wind Coordinating Committee (2003) suggested that it may be more appropriate to determine the biological significance of impacts, bearing in mind that any cumulative increase in anthropogenic take could be argued to be of biological significance. In general, a focus on specific populations of defined protected areas or on national or international populations, as tends to occur in EIA and especially Appropriate Assessment in Europe, simplifies the issues somewhat.;Populationlevel impacts stem from effects on components of individual fitness such as reproductive output and the prospects of survival. Even onshore, where more studies have been conducted, and for birds, probably the taxon with the most available information, very few studies have demonstrated that wind farms affect individual fitness through displacement, and therefore there is little prospect of populationscale impacts (Htker 2017). There are, however, a few examples of populationscale impacts as a result of collision mortality of individuals in species such as Whitetailed Eagle at Smla in Norway (see Dahl, Box 8.4 in de Lucas  Perrow 2017) and Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos at Altamont in California (Katzner et al. 2016). The emerging prospect of populationscale impacts onshore is perhaps because a number of rigorous longterm studies have now been conducted. This contrasts with the situation offshore, where there are currently no examples of populationscale impacts of collision mortality, perhaps stemming from the difficulty of measuring and quantifying collision (see Collision with turbines, above, and King, Chapter 9), coupled with the relative immaturity of the industry.;However, the coastal wind farm at Zeebrugge has had detectable effects upon several species of terns at the scale of the regional population (Everaert  Stienen, Chapter 9, Box 9.1). This reinforces that even a single wind farm or development area could have an impact on a particular population, as has been seen onshore. Nevertheless, the prospect of populationscale impacts intuitively increases as incombination and cumulative effects grow (see In combination and cumulative effects, above), as was clear from the few modelling studies cited by Vanermen  Stienen (Chapter 8)
