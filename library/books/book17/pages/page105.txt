 Total volume of upwelling As a starting point, a wind driven upwelling of about 2,000 m3s is assumed (see Potential ecosystem effects, Box 3.2 and 3.3), although the exact number is unknown for a realistic wind farm.; Annual production of carbon If the wind blows on 100 days a year in the productive season, this results in 16,000 t C per year in artificially induced primary production. If the area of the upwelling is 20 times as large as the wind farm, this corresponds to about 33 g Cm2 per year in new annual production, which is the same as the lower estimate from the literature outlined above. The estimate of the increased annual productivity from a single wind farm is about 0.5 of the total production in the entire North Sea, thus 20 wind farms would correspond to, say, a 2 increase in productivity for the entire North Sea.; Total herring production If the weight of wet fish is about ten times the weight of C in fish, this implies that an additional 160,000 t of Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus may be produced per year. If 1 kg of herring is worth 1, the total value is 160 million per year.  Total production of salmoncod If 10 is transferred from Atlantic Herring to Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar or Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua according to trophic efficiency, then 16,000 t salmoncod per year may be produced.
