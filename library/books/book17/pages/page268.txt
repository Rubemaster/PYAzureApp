During the day, migrating landbirds can often be observed to follow the coastline and to refrain from crossing open water (Drury  Keith 1962 Hppop et al. 2010). Nocturnal migrants seem generally less sensitive to a landsea transition and rather cross water bodies in broad front migration (Myres 1964 Bruderer  Liechti 1998 Diehl et al. 2003 Archibald et al. 2017). However, several exceptions were found where coasts guide the routes of nocturnal migrants, such as in the Netherlands, Germany, and Nova Scotia (Richardson 1978a Jellmann 1988 Buurma 1995). Over the course of a night, the proportion of migrants redirecting along or towards the coast or even reversing their flight direction may increase (Bruderer  Liechti 1998 Fortin et al. 1999 Hppop et al. 2006 Horton et al. 2016 Nilsson  Sjberg 2016 Archibald et al. 2017).;Radar observations revealed that the density of migrating landbirds is highest near continental margins, but significant migrations have also been detected more than 3,000 km from land (Williams  Williams 1990). Migrating terrestrial bird species repeatedly cross large bodies of water such as the Mediterranean Sea (Fortin et al. 1999 Meyer et al. 2000 Agostini et al. 2005 2015) or the Gulf of Mexico (Robinson et al. 1996) the latter including the tiny, 34 g Rubythroated Hummingbird Archilochus colubris. Birds are also known to island hop before making the 800 km Caribbean Sea crossing to South America (BirdLife International 2010), and within the Atlantic American flyway, a few small songbird species even fly large distances over the western Atlantic Ocean to avoid detours along the coast (DeLuca et al. 2015).;Soaring birds, such as storks, pelicans, and many (broadwinged) raptors, are generally dependent for lift on thermals created by the differential warming of the lands surface or updrafts created by topography (Kerlinger 1985 Baisner et al. 2010 Malmiga et al. 2014 Miller et al. 2016 Nourani  Yamaguchi 2017). Most long distance migratory birds of prey appear especially reluctant to fly even short distances over water, and instead migrate mainly, if not entirely, over land and circumvent larger bodies of water. They tend to concentrate in large numbers at isthmuses, islands and other geographic bottlenecks to take the shortest sea crossings (Williams et al. 1977 Looft  Busche 1981 Kerlinger 1984 1985 Meyer et al.
