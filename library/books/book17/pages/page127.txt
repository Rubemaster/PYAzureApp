The most obvious habitat change coinciding with the constructionof an OWF is undoubtedly the introduction of artificial hard substrata. The windturbine foundation, erosion or scour protection layer (Figure 4.2) and possible cable toppings all contribute to the introduction of habitat for hardsubstratum epifauna typically in a predominantly softsediment environment, representing up to 0.5 ha (monopile foundation) to 1.2 ha (gravitybase foundation) artificial hard substratum added to the marine environment per square kilometre of windfarm area (Rumes et al. 2013).
