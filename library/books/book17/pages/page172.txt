EMFs are emitted into the local environment mainly from subsea cables as a result of wind turbines generating electricity (Gill et al. 2012b Thomsen et al. 2015). There are two main types of cable highvoltage alternating current (HVAC) and highvoltage direct current (HVDC). Both types emit magnetic fields into the surrounding environment and HVAC also directly induces electric fields within the adjacent seawater (Figure 5.3). Furthermore,movement through the magnetic fields, either by an animal swimming or via tidal stream or water currents, induces electric fields (Figure 5.3). Both components of the EMF (i.e. magnetic and electric fields) propagate outwards at a decreasing rate with distance from the cable source, thereby creating an EMF zone in the water around the cable of several tens to hundreds of metres, which scales up as the cable current and voltage increase (Thomsen et al. 2015 Copping et al. 2016). The EMF zone will also extend along the length of a cable and will be associated with all cables within the array and in the export cables to shore (Gill et al. 2014). Thus, the emitted EMF may constitute a potential extended barrier to movement for sensitive migratory species in shallow coastal waters, such as migratory eels (Westerberg  Lagenfelt 2008).
