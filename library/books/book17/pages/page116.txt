As a final remark, the upper ocean may respond strongly to the presence of large OWFs as predicted by a solid theoretical foundation. Moreover, this chapter also presents some observational evidence that reinforces the point that theoretical predictions are reliable, although more observations on the wind wake and the upper ocean response are needed to confirm those theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the response to more realistic windfarm configurations needs to be assessed, along with more detailed analyses on the effects of increased upwelling and downwelling on the marine ecosystem. The indication from limited study to date is that the response in the ocean covers a much larger area than the wind farm itself. Accordingly, if large wind farms become abundant, the interaction between wind farms will start to play an important role. The focus so far has been on the shortterm ocean response, and evaluation of longterm change needs further study.
