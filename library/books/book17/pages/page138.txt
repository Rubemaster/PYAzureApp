On a local scale within the Belgian part of the North Sea, during a fouryear study, specific age groups of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua and Pouting Trisopterus luscus were shown to be seasonally attracted towards offshore wind farms, showing high site fidelity (Reubens et al. 2013 Reubens et al., Box 5.1, Chapter 5). The fish fed upon the dominant epifaunal prey species present (Figure 4.5) and growth was observed throughout the period for which the fish were present, indicating extra biological production on a local scale (Reubens et al. 2013). However, not all fish species may benefit from these hotspots for instance, stomach content analysis showsthat hardsubstratum associated organisms were an insignificant food component of pelagic Atlantic Mackerel Scomber scombrus and Horse Mackerel Trachurus trachurus caught within the German Alpha Ventus wind farm (Figure 4.6), with these fish showing a significantly reduced degree of stomach fullness compared with those caught outside the wind farm (Krone  Krgefsky 2013).;Figure 4.5 Large predators such as large mobile crabs, fish and starfish profit from the shelter and the additional food source, such as these Blue Mussels Mytilus edulis, provided by offshore windfarm structures.
