 Location provides opportunities (for habitat creation) as well as threats (to the local biota and habitats), and both need to be considered together.  Climate change will increase the variability of an already highly variable system, making it increasingly difficult to detect the effects of the wind farm and its structures.;This chapter mainly draws on experiences from northwestern European waters as this region is the focus for offshore wind, although theoretical considerations and other evidence is also given for sites elsewhere, such as in the USA. The review builds on previous work by the authors and their collaborators and uses both primary and secondary published and peerreviewed literature as well as grey literature in the public domain. Unfortunately, there are many studies and much information held by the offshore wind industry that are not yet publicly available. In addition, the chapter covers both empirical results and theoretical considerations, especially as the number of publicly available studies is still relatively limited and the consequences of wind farms for individuals, populations and communities are still poorly understood.
