Decommissioning guidance for OWFs in the UK sea area generally recommends a full removal of all components together with the associated disturbances that this would cause to the benthos. However, legislation at both EU and national level could allow for a partial removal of components in some cases (Smyth etal. 2015) (Box 4.4). Provisions exist at a national level for example, Danish law allows for partial decommissioning in cases where full decommissioning would lead to an environmental hazard (CCC 2010) and Dutch law only requires monopiles to be cut to 4 m below sea level (CCC 2010), suggesting that leaving benthic components of wind farms in place may be possible in both Danish and Dutch waters. In UK waters, the recommendations (DECC 2011) suggest removal of the foundations and monopile, but leaving the scour protection in situ, and several site decommissioning plans cite this as their option, often mentioning artificial reefs as a reason (see a review of these plans in Smyth et al. 2015). Finally, in Belgian waters, a full restoration of the area to its original state is required.;International Maritime Organization (IMO) Guidelines and Standards for the Removal of Offshore Installations and Structures on the Continental Shelf and in the Exclusive Economic Zone IMO Resolution A.672 (paragraph 3.5) states that where entire removal would involve an unacceptable risk to the marine environment, the coastal State may determine that it need not be fully removed. And the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the NorthEast Atlantic (OSPAR) Windfarm Guidance 20083 (paragraph 93) correspondingly states that if the competent national authority decides that a component of the windfarm should remain at site (e.g. parts of the piles in the seabed, scour protection materials), it should be ensured that they have no adverse impact on the environment, the safety of navigation and other uses of the sea. This guidance especially links to a provision in the OSPAR document Decision 983 on the Disposal of Disused Offshore Installations, which states in paragraph 8d that The assessment of the disposal options shall take into account impacts on the marine environment, including exposure of biota to contaminants associated with the installation, other
