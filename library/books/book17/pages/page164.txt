There is opinion that there are positive andor negative effects, and hence the view here is that positive and negative impacts are terms that depend on how they are defined and who is interpreting them. The evidence for effects on fish was considered as changes orresponses of biological or ecological relevance, whereas impacts on fish were defined as biologically or ecologically significant changes, responses or effects, following the definition of Boehlert and Gill (2010). It was anticipated that the focus when interpreting whether impacts occurred would be on the biologically significant effects on species, although the consequences for species assemblages and the wider community also needed to be taken into account when attempting to translate impacts to the local marine ecosystem. Therefore, the evidence for effects on species was considered and, where possible, the species assemblages as well, as this provided the opportunity to present the case for or against, better or worse, and also to address future direction of research and topic knowledge gaps, particularly where the effects may translate further into ecological impacts.;To consider why and how fish may be affected by OWFs, it is necessary to identify and determine the knowledge of ecological effects of OWFs on fish. As such, the starting point is to look at the biological attributes that may make the fish more or less likely to be affected, before considering the evidence with respect to OWFs.;The majority of fish species that inhabit the waters where OWFs have been developed or are planned have life histories that will bring them into contact with the developments. It may be a single life stage, such as adult spawning aggregations for reproduction, or multiple life stages, for example the egg and juvenile developmental stages. The key considerations are the lifecycle stage of the fish, the duration of exposure and the spatial overlap of the OWF with the fishs functional habitat linked to a particular life stage (Gill 2005 Inger et al. 2009).
