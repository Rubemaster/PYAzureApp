The single most significant habitat change associated with OWFsis the shift from an openwater (pelagic) environment to one with new, hard surfaces and a more complex threedimensional structure (Boehlert  Gill 2010 Wilhelmsson et al. 2010 Dannheim et al., Chapter 4). This shift is depicted in Figure 5.4, where the focus is on the physical habitat features that are likely to influence the presence or absence of fish within an area. As a consequence, one would expect significant changes in the trophic structure of an ecosystem where fish are a major component, in terms of both local biological production, that is, biomass, and trophic linkages within the ecosystem (Figure 5.5). This is discussed further in Ecological change, below.;Figure 5.4 Depiction of the habitats available to fish before offshore wind farm (OWF) installation (left of dashed vertical line) and once the wind farm has been installed. Note the increase in hard surface and the potential changes to hydrodynamics.
