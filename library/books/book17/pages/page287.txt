Turbine collision fatalities are the key factor when assessing the ecological impact of wind farms on birds and bats (for the extremely diverse situation onshore, see de Lucas  Perrow 2017 and Barclay et al. 2017a). Offshore, collisions with artificial structures are extremely difficult to quantify. On the one hand, there are serious logistical and methodological constraints (Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5) and on the other hand, collision risk depends on a broad set of different ecological variables, whichinfluence overall migration intensity, such as seasonal timing, weather and wind conditions, individual body conditions, intensity of migration, flight height, group of species and location (Figure 7.4). These variables may also mutually counteract or even cumulatively add up their possibly negative effects.;There may also be a difference in collision risk depending on the type of structure, for example static platforms with lattice towers and guy wires or power lines versus smooth, columnar wind turbines with rotating blades (Hill et al. 2014b Brenninkmeijer  Klop 2017 de Lucas  Perrow 2017). As previously noted, lights also play an important role as a potential attractant to both birds and bats (e.g. Ballasus et al. 2009 Gauthreaux  Belser 2006 Hppop  Hilgerloh 2012 Longcore et al. 2008 2012 Voigt et al. 2017) (Box 7.1). What is striking, however, about the collision mortality data from onshore wind farms is the relative absence of largescale fatality events, compared with those recorded at tall communication towers supported by guy wires, where collisions of hundreds of birds occur at times in a single night (Kerlinger et al. 2010).;Offshore and nearshore bird collisions have been reported from a variety of anthropogenic structures, mainly lighthouses and lightvessels, but also from platforms and brightly illuminated ships (Clarke 1912 Wiese et al. 2001 Ballasus et al. 2009 Vaughan 2009 Bocetti 2011 Ronconi et al. 2015). The vast majority of recorded fatalities were nocturnal migrants, mainly passerines, attracted by light under adverse conditions such as haze or drizzle. In principle, mass collisions are rare episodic events, but hundreds to thousands of birds may be affected in a single night. This box presents a brief chronology of evidence stretching back nearly 140 years.
