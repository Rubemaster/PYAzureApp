Figure 7.2 (a) Waterfowl (e.g. Darkbellied Brent Goose Branta bernicla), (b) waders (e.g. Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola, Sanderling Calidris alba, Purple Sandpiper Calidris maritima, Dunlin Calidris alpina, Ruff Philomachus pugnax, Bartailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres), and (c) passerines (e.g. Snow Bunting Plectrophenax nivalis) are the major groups of birds (other than seabirds) detected during visual offshore observations in the North Sea. (a, b) Jochen Dierschke (c) Martin Perrow;Since the early voyages of Columbus, large numbers of passerines and shorebirds migrating from eastern North America to the Caribbean and South America have been reported from ships crossing the western North Atlantic (Williams et al. 1977). In Europe, the first written evidence of offshore landbird migration goes back to the sixteenth century, when incredible swarms of birds were described for the tiny remote island of Helgoland in the North Sea (Stresemann 1967). For its inhabitants, the huge number of birds was a welcome supplement to their poor diets. Later, bird collectors and scientists became aware of the surprising dimension of offshore bird movements (Gtke 1895 Dierschke et al. 2011 Hppop  Hppop 2011). Offshore migration was confirmed by innumerable observations on other, sometimes far more remote islands, in both the old and the new world (Gosse 1847 Gundlach 1861 Drury  Keith 1962 Williams et al. 1977 DeSante  Ainley 1980 Williams  Williams 1990 Yong et al. 2015), on lighthouses or lightvessels (e.g. Blasius 18931894 Clarke 1912 Hansen 1954 Gauthreaux  Belser 2006 Vaughan 2009).;The intensity of offshore bird migration is generally higher in autumn than in spring and it peaks during the night and the early morning hours (e.g. Hppop et al. 2006 Fijn et al. 2015). Migration intensities offshore vary substantially from day to day and are concentrated on a few days and nights, namely in areas with rapidly changing weather conditions such as the North Sea (Gruber
