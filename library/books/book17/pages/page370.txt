The development of offshore wind energy is projected to increase in scale and distribution around the world although seabird collision is perceived as a major ecological risk. This chapter aims to review the existing evidence of seabird collision and avoidance at offshore wind farms (OWFs) and, where this is unavailable, at onshore and coastal turbines. It finds that few collision studies have been undertaken at constructed OWFs and empirical evidence of collision of seabirds is rather limited. However, both onshore and offshore, gull species are the most regularly reported collision victims followed by terns at coastal and onshore sites. A case study of tern mortality shows that this may be significant. In general, emerging evidence suggests that seabirds tend to avoid offshore wind farms at a range of scales with empirical avoidance rates now calculated at above 99. This is well above the original default rates based on land birds at onshore wind farms. A review of the factors influencing collision risk, including speciesspecific and windfarm specific factors and general location, showed that the percentage of time spent flying at collision risk height appears to be most important. In this case, as technology advances with larger turbines, the proportion of birds at risk height is likely to reduce. A review of the seabird sensitivity indices developed to understand the vulnerability of individual species to collision, and to identify collision risk in sea areas where development may be planned, concludes that they are most useful to identify species for impact assessment and as a strategic planning tool. They may also help to
