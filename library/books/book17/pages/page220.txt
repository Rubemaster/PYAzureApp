Most offshore turbines have been installed on steel foundations that are anchored by large steel piles driven into the seabed by hydraulic hammers. While for jacket and tripod foundations piles of a moderate diameter of 23 m are usually used, monopiles have reached diameters of 8 m and the use of 10 m monopiles has been envisaged. The piles are driven into the seabed to depths of 2040 m with several thousand blows of up to 4,000 kJ at a frequency of 3040 blowsminute.;Impact pile driving of large steel foundations radiates substantial levels of lowfrequency impulsive noise into the water column, which can propagate over large distances. Pile driving noise consists of short pulses of 0.10.3 seconds.;The averaging start and stop times T1 and T2 are chosen arbitrarily, but in a way that the sound event lies in between T1 and T2 (Figure 6.4). T0 is 1 second that is, the SEL is the level of a continuous sound with a duration of 1 second and the same sound energy as the impulse. The SEL is independent of the blow rate.
