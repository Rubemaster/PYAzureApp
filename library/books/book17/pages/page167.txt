Habitat features influence the distribution and community composition of fish, and this is most pronounced when it comes to bottom habitats. A range of factors may influence the fish community structure in association with different types of bottom habitats, such as structural factors including complexity, surface structure, void space and number of interior spaces, and habitat area degree of isolation in relation to equivalent habitats composition of prey items predators and the surrounding seabed (Grove et al. 1991 Kim et al. 1994 Lan  Hsui 2006). The importance of different factors varies between species, trophic groups and spatial use patterns of fish (Moffit et al. 1989 Grove et al. 1991 Kim et al. 1994). Many reefassociated fish are limited by the availability of shelter sites, and often the amount of suitable habitat is suggested to be limiting during certain life stages, for example the early benthic phase or spawning (Chojnacki 2000 Hunter  Sayer 2009).;OWFs have defined periods during which the changes to the marine environment that may affect fish will differ, namely the pre construction surveying and construction, operation and decommissioning phases (level 1 in the environmental effects framework in Figure 5.1). The preconstructionconstruction and the decommissioning phases are expected to have the strongest influence on fish in terms of acute, shortterm effects (Figure 5.1), as they represent the greatest amount of structural and habitat change, and are the busiest periods in terms of boat traffic and the noisiest times over periods of several months. However, more interest is emerging in the longterm operational phase (2030 years), where the structures represent new habitat and environmental attributes which are likely to cause some response in the fish over time through chronic, longterm effects (Figure 5.1). Furthermore, in this
