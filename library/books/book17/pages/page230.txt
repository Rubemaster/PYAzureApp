According to Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA) licence conditions, Skeate et al. (2012) used aerial surveys aboard a Cessna 150 aerobat aircraft flying at around 300 m to assess the response of Harbour and Grey Seals using haulouts for a fiveyear period from 2002 to 2006 before, during andafter the construction of Scroby Sands. In each year, between 10 and 15 surveys were undertaken at low water at regular intervals in the period from April to October inclusive, according to licence requirements, meaning that no surveys were undertaken during the period of pile driving from 21 October 2003 to 1 January 2004. During each survey, a series of images designed to cover the entire emergent bank was taken with a digital SLR camera. The resultant images were displayed in Abode Photoshop, where the seals could be identified to species level through a combination of size, body shape, muzzle shape, colour and haulout pattern, with further identification of sex and age in relation to pups whenever possible (Figure 6.8).;Figure 6.8 Aerial image of typical patterns of Harbour Seal (left of line) and Grey Seal (right of line) haulouts with colourcoded identification of species and age for illustrative purposes in the former, as follows yellowHarbour Seal adult orangeHarbour Seal pup pinkGrey Seal bull light blueGrey Seal cow.
