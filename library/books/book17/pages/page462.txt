2013 (Table 10.3, Figure 10.13). What may have been a pair of Roseate Terns Sterna dougallii, the UKs rarest breeding seabird, was observed in 2013 (Figure 10.13), with another seen in 2018 (RSPB, personal communication). Data from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) now suggest that the Common Terns breeding as a qualifying species at the nearby Breydon Water Special Protection Area are now entirely located on Scroby Sands.;Figure 10.13 Part of the Common Tern Sterna hirundo colony at Scroby Sands in 2013 that included a possible pair of Roseate Terns Sterna dougallii (middle and right in flight). Up to 200 pairs of Little Terns Sternula albifrons have bred since 2010, and Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis recolonised in 2013 after an absence of 37 years. (Martin Perrow)
