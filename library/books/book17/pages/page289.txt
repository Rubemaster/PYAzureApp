Catharus ustulatus (9.2), Common Yellowthroat Geothlypis trichas (8.7), Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus (7.9), Redeyed Vireo Vireo olivaceus (7.0) and Blackpoll Warbler Setophaga striata (5.5). The change in beam characteristics in 1989 to a narrower and less powerful beam resulted in a drastic reduction in avian mortality at the lighthouse.;Illuminated oil, gas and research platforms may also attract birds in large numbers despite their much less intensive lights compared to lighthouses and lightvessels. Attracted birds may die after collision with infrastructure, and overexposure to heat from or incineration in flares (Ronconi et al. 2015). For example, Bourne (1979) had assumed annual mortality in flares to be a few hundred birds per platform.;Mller (1981) estimated that within only 6 hours during a night in October, some 120,000 birds of at least 37 species passed a research platform in the German part of the North Sea. Undoubtedly attracted by the platforms lights, many birds crashed into the lamps along the catwalks surrounding the platform. A total of 248 fatalities were found, 52.5 of which were Song Thrushes Turdus philomelos, alongside Meadow Pipits Anthus pratensis (14.5), and Eurasian Skylarks (12.1) and other songbirds. Right after switching off the deck lights, the number of birds at the platform dropped dramatically, as did the number of fatalities.;On an illuminated research platform with an 81 m lattice tower in the southern North Sea, a total of 767 birds of 34 species, mainly thrushes, Common Starling and other passerines, were found on 45 of 160 visits from October 2003 to December 2007. Collisions were estimated to be at least 150 birds per year (Hppop et al. 2016).;The episodic nature of bird fallout related to attraction to lights at offshore structures has made it difficult to quantify mortality. Moreover, many victims fall into the water and are washed away. In the Gulf of Mexico, it is estimated that the nearly 4,000 platforms may cause roughly 200,000 collision fatalities per year and some estimates of total annual bird mortality at oil and gas platforms in the North Sea are as high as 6 million birds (Ronconi et al. 2015).
