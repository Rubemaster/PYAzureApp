This chapter considers the effect of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on the atmosphere and ocean dynamics by first outlining the basic features of ocean dynamics that underpin the oceanic response. In simple terms, OWFs extract energy from the wind, thereby decreasing wind speed and increasing turbulence levels in the lower atmosphere. The impact on the dynamics of the upper ocean is not yet well understood and is based on theoretical predictions and a single case study at the Alpha Ventus windfarm test site in German waters. Nevertheless, lower wind speed implies that the wind stress on the ocean surface becomes smaller. More importantly, the horizontal gradients in the wind stress will become artificially large, thereby creating a convergencedivergence in the winddriven (Ekman) transport. Thus, this windwake effect will create both upwelling and downwelling, with the additional possibility of relatively strong horizontal currents. Exploratory analysis shows that a wind farm of 55 km2 may induce an artificial upwelling in the order of 1 mday over an area of 200 km2 or around eight to ten times the area of the wind farm, which corresponds to a total upwelling of roughly 2,000 m3s or about 2108 m3day. Upwelling is a known driver for ocean productivity and the prediction is that OWFs may increase productivity substantially. By simply extrapolating numbers on upwelling and estimated nutrient
