Those delivering OWFs face unique technical and operational complexities due to the rapid pace of development and the challenging environments in which these structures are constructed. Since the first commercial offshore wind turbines were installed at Vindeby in 1991, the pace of technological development for all offshore wind components has continued to increase, with the development of more efficient, more robust and, in some cases, larger components, from wind turbines and foundations, interarray and export cables, to platforms and construction equipment, to improve the productivity of wind farms. Moreover, innovators are developing technology to take the interactions with the marine environment into consideration and to address and reduce potential environmental impacts.;The interactions between offshore wind technology and environmental receptors are continuing to be better understood. Notably, the majority of OWFs installed within European waters to date have been of a similar nature. However, as offshore wind begins to expand into Asia and the USA, and beyond, there will be differences in both the ecosystems in which wind farms are installed and the species within them, with regard to their physiology, behaviour and sensitivity to disturbance.;The development of floating offshore wind structures will soon enable some countries to achieve 100 power from renewable energy and others to reduce significantly their dependence on fossil fuels. With the increased adoption of offshore wind and technological development allowing greater efficiency and dependency of renewable energy generation, the price of offshore wind is expected to reach parity with fossil fuels, as demonstrated by the recent round of UK CfD subsidy allocation, the results of which were announced in September 2017.
