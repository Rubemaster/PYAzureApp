Figure 10.7 Longspined Sea Scorpion Tauralus bubalis, an obligate hard bottom dwelling small fish, which did not occur away from the turbine foundations at the Alpha Ventus windfarm site in the North Sea.;Perhaps more notable than the list of species present, these biofouling, typically filterfeeding assemblages rapidly attain impressive biomass. At Alpha Ventus, the average biomass increased from around 1 kgm2 less than a year after foundation installation to around 25 kgm2 around 18 months later. This was, however, at 1 m below the surface, and at depths of 510 m the biomass appeared to quickly stabilise at 1 kgm2 or so.;Modelling by Adams et al. (2014) reinforced the notion that wind farms could operate as ecological stepping stones for hard substratum species with pelagic larvae, thereby allowing range expansion including of climate migrants responding to climate change. On a positive note, such species may include vulnerable native species that are currently range restricted, but with the downside that some invasive species may also be favoured, including those without pelagic larvae that may be deposited through the use of attendant vessels that may be inadvertently carrying such species, including in ballast water. Any concern about the spread of invasive species does not appear to have been realised
