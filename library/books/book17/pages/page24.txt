It should be noted that this chapter does not provide a systematic review of all available evidence. It is based mainly on the working experiences of the authors, drawn upon from European and Scandinavian waters, where offshore wind has the longest track record and experience from pre, during and postconstructionstudies.;An OWF involves a number of uniquely designed components working together to transform wind energy into electricity that is then transported to shore via export cables, and connected to the electricity grid via an onshore connection point. As demonstrated in Figure 1.2, a wind farm is made up of multiple wind turbines, supported by foundations and connected to other turbines and any offshore platforms via interarray cables. If required, one or more offshore substations will step up the voltage of the power generated offshore before electricity is transmitted via one or more export cables to the onshore substation. Transmission may be alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) in the latter case, offshore converter stations will convert AC electricity to DC before export. Highvoltage direct current (HVDC) transmission may be preferable when an OWF is sited far from shore, as electrical losses over distance are reduced. The onshore substation will further transform the electricity generated offshore to a voltage and form suitable for entry into the national transmission or distribution network. Depending on the location and purpose of each windfarm component, most will have some potential for interaction with environmental receptors.
