The level of benthic monitoring required to detect significant effects is proportional to the degree of change expected (Gray  Elliott 2009), and the changes may be at the microscale (individual monopile), mesoscale (between monopiles within a wind farm), macroscale (at the whole windfarm scale) and megascale (between wind farms within a region). The monitoring should include the substratum type (e.g. particlesize analysis), organiccontent of sediment, habitat mapping, faunal abundance, species richness (number of species), diversity (e.g. using many diversity indices) and biomass (as an indication of fish prey present) (Gray  Elliott 2009). The monitoring may also be required to show an analysis of the biological traits of the benthos as an indication of the links between the fauna and its habitat.;The monitoring of the seabed follows welldefined and accepted methods (Gray  Elliott 2009 Eleftheriou 2013) but should be subjected to analytical quality control and quality assurance (Elliott 1993). This will ensure that the data produced in any EIA are legally defendable and can be used as a baseline against which future changes are judged.;This chapter has aimed to summarise the salient points relating to the influence of OWFs on marine benthos. While it is not possible to cover every study in an expanding field, the assessment may be summarised in the light of the eight underpinning hypotheses of this chapter (Table 4.1). This shows that there are many effects of OWFs on the benthos of which we already have a good understanding, but also suggests that often we do not take a sufficiently wideranging and holistic view.
