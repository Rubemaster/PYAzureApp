Figure 6.1 Marine mammals typically considered in studies investigatingimpacts associated with offshore wind farms in Europe. Clockwise from top right Harbour Porpoise Phocoena phocoena, Bottlenose Dolphin Tursiops truncatus, Harbour Seal Phoca vitulina and Grey Seal Halichoerus grypus. Effects on large whales, such as Humpback Whale Megaptera novaeangliae (top left), are likely to require consideration in other areas of the world or if developments are planned in deeper waters. (Martin Perrow);This chapter provides an overview of current knowledge regarding the effects and impacts of OWFs on marine mammals. A review was conducted through internet searches, using key search terms such as marine mammals, offshore wind farms, impact assessments, disturbance, noise and piling, and combinations of these words. This further expanded the literature already held by the authors as a result of the experience and activities of their consultantresearch organisations in relation to marine mammals and OWFs. The review is not exhaustive, but aims to provide an overview of the state of knowledge at the time of writing, particularly on noise exposure, and to identify critical gaps in our understanding.;Windfarm related processes that may affect marine mammals include seismic surveys to determine geological conditions installation of foundations, particularly through noisy pile driving increased vessel activity during surveys and construction, leading to disturbance and even possible collision suspension of sediments and disturbance of the seabed, including through cable laying release of pollutants and decommissioning (Figure 6.2). The presence of turbines will also be associated with other pressures, such as noise and vibration and changed local hydrodynamics, but with the benefit of providing artificial reefs and sanctuary from fishing activity, both leading to the accumulation of potential prey (Figure 6.2). This suite of negative and positive effects form the basis of the Themes presented below, with the exclusion of disturbance of the seabed, which is generally assumed to be short term, and the release of pollutants, which has only rarely been documented (see Rees  Judd, Chapter 2) and with no demonstrable effect upon marine mammals. Nor does this review specifically consider other potential effects, such as electromagnetic fields from cables, scour
