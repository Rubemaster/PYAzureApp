The second type of pollution reported concerned two incidences where the protective paint on the monopiles failed. This was manifested by osmoticelectrolytic blistering in the splash zone due to encapsulated solvent following the application of a single thick coating of paint (Figure 2.6). This was contrary to the recommended and usual multilayered approach in which solvent is allowed to evaporate between applications.;Figure 2.6 Offshore wind turbine tower and yellow paint spill on the surface of the water during paint application.
