Figure 5.5 Depiction of the ecological interactions based on trophic linkage and energy flow with the habitats available to fish before offshore windfarm (OWF) installation (left of dashed vertical line) and once the OWF has been installed. Note the increased number of links and the change in size of the grey circular representations of relative fish population.;The direct physical loss of habitat for softbottom dwelling species owing to the installation of wind turbines and scour protection typically represents a small percentage of the whole windfarm area as a result of each turbine only claiming up to a few hundred square metres. Although the ecological footprint can extend beyond the physical structures, any changes in the significance of the original benthic community structure of the surrounding seabed may be relatively localised (Ashley et al. 2014). The key change is that portions of the seabed are replaced by hard bottom substrata in the form of submerged foundations and predominantly rock scour protection of offshore wind turbine bases with a larger total surface area than the lost softbottom patches (Figure 5.4). It is anticipated that this availability of new substrata will influence the nature of the benthic community and thus the
