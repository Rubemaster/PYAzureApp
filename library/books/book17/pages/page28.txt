The foundation, or support structure, secures the turbine to the seabed. Foundations must be strong enough and deep enough to stabilise the entire construction under the constant battering of wind, waves, tide and current. Offshore foundation design is highly specialised, owing to marked differences in water depth, ground and metocean conditions between sites. These foundations are typically also much larger than their onshore equivalents, with standard monopiles ranging up to 6 m in diameter and extralarge monopiles exceeding 7 m in diameter (Figure 1.5). Offshore foundations must account for increased mechanical stresses andgreater distance between the base of the tower and the seabed than their onshore counterparts. In the case of the monopile foundation, the height from the tower base to the full depth below the seabed can easily be as great as that from tower base to blade tip. Considering that the largest deployed turbines now approach a blade tip height of 200 m, this is a significant feat of engineering.;Figure 1.5 Maximum monopile diameter and maximum monopile weight from 1994 to 2017 and predicted in the future. (Renewables Consulting Group 2017).; Monopile. These relatively simple structures comprise cylindrical steel tubes (Figure 1.6) driven into the seabed to a depth governed by site conditions. They are an economical choice in shallower waters but less suitable in deeper waters or for larger turbine models. The installation process for monopiles usually requires the use of a jackup vessel, which is raised on four steel legs to ensure stability and the precise positioning of the vessel. The jackup vessel will have a heavy lift crane and offshore piledriving hammer on board. The heavylift crane is used to lift the monopile into place with the driving hammer positioned above the pile, then a hydraulic
