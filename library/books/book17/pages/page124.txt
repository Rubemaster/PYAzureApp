 Offshore wind farm artificial reefs create benthic diversity hotspots. Adding new artificial hard substratum to the marine ecosystem, OWFs create new habitat for benthic species, some of which migrate from outside the area. The exclusion of fisheries further contributes to the development of the softsediment benthic communities. This promotion of biodiversity, however, is counteracted by the disturbance of the natural seabed by the installation of the wind farms. This theme evaluates the level at which OWFs truly create hotspots of benthic diversity.; Offshore wind farms alter the benthic food web. Owing to the changes in benthic diversity, trophic interactions between benthic species and higher trophic levels will change as a consequence of OWFs. Predatory and scavenging species attraction and organic enrichment all contribute to the creation of a windfarm food web that is very different from that occurring naturally.; Restoration potential following decommissioning. As there are similarities in methodologies for construction and decommissioning, a consideration of decommissioning is appropriate for an overall understanding of the effects that may arise for the seabed and its communities.  Monitoring programmes, sampling design and analysis. Numerous studies on OWF effects have been conducted in the framework of environmental impact assessments. Whether these investigations delivered the information needed to appropriately assess the impacts on the benthic ecosystem is evaluated.
