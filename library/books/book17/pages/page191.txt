The response of the fish community to OWFs will occur overdifferent spatial scales through time, as determined by lifehistory factors, appropriate habitat development, resource availability and the presence of fish species in adjacent areas to take advantage of the new habitat. The changes are expected to be similar to those observed with structures in the offshore oil and gas sector (Box 5.2).;Box 5.2 Significant fish community productivity associated with oil and gas platforms according to Claisse et al. (2014).;A number of studies of oil and gas platform structures in the marine environment have reported changes to the fish community in terms of abundance, species presence and distribution, with this scenario being repeated around the world, including in the Gulf of Mexico (increased fish abundance) (Stanley  Wilson 1996), North Sea (persistent residency) (Jrgensen et al. 2002), Adriatic Sea (higher species richness and diversity) (Fabi et al. 2004) and Australia (early lifestage recruitment) (Neira 2005).;Clear evidence of how these artificial hard substrates can significantly increase fish productivity has been shown during systematic and repeated surveys of oil and gas platforms off the Californian coast (Claisse et al. 2014). The study focused on the determination of secondary production, defined by the authors as new animal biomass from growth for all individuals in a given area during some period of time. The key reason for assessing secondary production, focusing on the fish community, was to take into account the multiple characteristics of the fish community based on density, body size, growth and survivorship in a single metric to represent ecological function. This enabled the authors to compare the annual secondary production of fish communities on the oil and gas platforms surveyed with those on southern Californian natural reefs (Figure 5.11) and with secondary production estimates from other marine ecosystems.
