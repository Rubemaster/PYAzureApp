7 King, Chapter 9 Perrow, Chapter 10). The Alpha Ventus research programme provides something of a model of assessment for developing markets.;The authority responsible for the seabed in the Netherlands is the Rijkswaterstaat, also known as the DirectorateGeneral for Public Works and Water Management. The Dutch approach to gaining consent is similar to that in Denmark, where the government takes on the cost and risk of site development including consenting. In July 2015, the Offshore Wind Energy Act came into force whereby the Dutch Ministries of Economic Affairs and of Infrastructure and the Environment were made responsible for the execution of the law and took over responsibility from offshore wind developers regarding spatial planning arrangements and environmental assessment of proposed projects. In addition, the government took responsibility for the offshore grid connection, with developers taking responsibility to ensure that all necessary permits are obtained for the realisation of the project. As part of their responsibilities, the Dutch Government will decide which sites can be developed and will undertake all relevant environmental data collection. This information is released publicly and made available to developers interested in bidding for the site. Therefore, in contrast to the UK approach, developers bidding for a site in the Netherlands are only required to consider, and demonstrate, the financial and technical feasibility of the project.;The European requirements of the Habitats and Birds Directives were transposed into Dutch law via the Natuurbeschermingswet 1998 (Nature Conservancy Act 1998). In January 2017, the Nature Conservation Act replaced the Flora and Fauna Act, 1998 Nature Conservancy Act and the Forestry Act, combining legislation from all three for application beyond 12 nautical miles offshore and covering the entire Dutch continental shelf.
