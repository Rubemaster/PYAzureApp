2010 Duarte et al. 2015). However, only a few studies have determined whether a stable community has been formed and how long it takes to form such a community.;As demonstrated in this chapter, there are positive and negative effects of wind farms on the marine benthos, and these require a risk and opportunity analysis and management framework (Cormier et al. 2013). Effects and benefits at the micro, meso and macro scales require upscaling to the megascale to determine larger influences. This requires not only international collaboration, but also linkage to other activities in the same sea region (Boyes et al. 2016) and wider conservation initiatives, such as Marine Protected Area designation and Maritime Spatial Planning, as well as the implementation of marine statutes such as EU Directives aimed at protecting natural functioning and delivering ecosystem services and societal benefits (e.g. Borja et al. 2017).;The authors acknowledge several offshore wind operators and study groups with which and with whom they have worked for example, the ICES Working Group on Marine Benthal and Renewable Energy Developments (WGMBRED). Despite this, any views here are those of the authors personally and not of any organisation.;Ambrose, R.F.  Anderson, T.W.
