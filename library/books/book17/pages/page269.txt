2000 Corso 2001 Agostini et al. 2005 2015 Berndt et al. 2005 Germi 2005 Bildstein 2006 Goodrich  Smith 2008 Hilgerloh 2009 Baisner et al. 2010 Farmer et al. 2010 Miller et al. 2016 Nourani  Yamaguchi 2017). For the largest species, such as Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus, even crossing the short distance of 14 km over the Strait of Gibraltar is an enormous challenge, with many birds attempting passage for weeks before crossing (Bildstein et al. 2009). Such barriers can be associated with a high mortality in large soaring birds, mainly in inexperienced young (Oppel et al. 2015). Hence, it is not surprising that these species seek refuge at offshore structures when confronted with adverse weather (Mote 1969 Moore 2000). The island effect, whereby birds are attracted by small islands offering refuge, was offered by Skov et al. (2016) as a plausible mechanism for the apparent attraction of raptors to wind farms when crossing part of the Baltic Sea, particularly under adverse wind conditions. Such attraction enhances the threat to a group of species known to be at high risk of collision with wind turbines (e.g. Drewitt  Langston 2008 Thaxter et al. 2017 de Lucas  Perrow 2017). Smaller raptor species with longer, narrower wings, such as falcons and accipiters, are more adapted to flapping flight than larger species and are more likely to cross large water bodies, with some regularly making longdistance movements across open water (Kerlinger 1985 Meyer et al. 2000 Bildstein 2006 Goodrich  Smith 2008 Concepcion et al. 2017).;There is less awareness of the offshore migration of night migrating passerines. During migration, many diurnal bird species become generally nocturnal. Roughly twothirds of the European bird species migrate mainly or exclusively at night (Martin 1990). Nocturnal migration saves time for refuelling at stopover sites during daytime (Newton 2008) and reduces predation risk by raptors (Newton 2008 but see Alerstam 1990) and, during the night, winds are less turbulent (Kerlinger  Moore 1989 Alerstam 2011 ShamounBaranes et al. 2017). Nocturnally migrating passerine birds can be frequently detected at offshore platforms (Figure 7.3), for example in the North Sea (e.g. Mller 1981 Hppop et al. 2006 2012 2016 Hppop  Hilgerloh 2012), the Baltic Sea (e.g. Sjberg et al. 2015) and the Gulf of Mexico (Russell 2005 Farnsworth  Russell 2007), or at remote islands such as Helgoland
