Figure 1.4 Weighted average turbine rating, weighted average hub height and weighted average rotor diameter from 1991 to 2017 and predicted in the future. (Renewables Consulting Group 2017);Although the threebladed horizontalaxis structure is the most commonly used technology to capture wind energy, there are alternatives. The most significant, but still much less common, is the verticalaxis wind turbine, with blades that spin around a central tower. As more innovative approaches to offshore wind generation come to the fore, this introduces additional uncertainty for both developers and those assessing applications for consent, as these technologies lack the body of empirical data needed to understand relative environmental impacts and support the permitting process.;The foundation, or support structure, secures the turbine to the seabed. Foundations must be strong enough and deep enough to stabilise the entire construction under the constant battering of wind, waves, tide and current. Offshore foundation design is highly specialised, owing to marked differences in water depth, ground and metocean conditions between sites. These foundations are typically also much larger than their onshore equivalents, with standard monopiles ranging up to 6 m in diameter and extralarge monopiles exceeding 7 m in diameter (Figure 1.5). Offshore foundations must account for increased mechanical stresses and
