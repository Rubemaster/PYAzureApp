Figure 5.7 Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua a large predatory species that is particularly attracted to the new habitats offered by windfarm structures in the North Sea. (Martin Perrow);The degree of aggregation of fish around wind turbines can also vary seasonally and diurnally (Reubens et al. 2013a), and the presence of windturbine foundations may increase residence time. For example, Reubens et al. (2011) recorded a school of approximately 22,000 Pouting, with an estimated total biomass of 2.5 t, residing around a single wind turbine for at least a year. Atlantic Cod have also shown relatively high site fidelity around wind turbines (de Troch et al. 2013) (Box 5.1). At Egmond aan Zee in the Netherlands, Winter et al. (2010) suggested that while Common Sole Solea solea did not spend more time in the wind farm compared with a control area, some of the juvenile Atlantic Cod population did reside for a longer time within the wind farm. However, the study was not designed to include any aggregations of fish in close association with the turbines, and parts of the fish assemblages may have been overlooked.
