Attraction is shown by species shaded in green with mean category scores 4, with avoidance shown by species shaded in red with mean scores 2, compared to species shaded grey with scores 2 and 4 that are indifferent andor inconsistent in their response. To further aid interpretation, species are also classified with () where results are reported as statistically significant, (d) where there is a clear change in distribution associated with the wind farm, and () where the effect is apparent up to 2 km from the wind farm. (Adapted from Dierschke et al. 2016);Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo were found to be strongly attracted to OWFs in four out of five studies, with one study not finding a convincing effect (Figure 8.6). The attraction effects recorded at the three Dutch wind farms and the Scottish Robin Rigg wind farm all proved statistically significant in a BAG analysis (Canning et al. 2013 Leopold et al. 2013 Skov et al. 2016). In contrast, for the Swedish Lillgrund OWF, Nilsson and Green (2011) found Great Cormorant to decrease in numbers in the OWF footprint area, but to increase strongly in the 2 km buffer zone.
