Whatever the scale of variation, modelled changes in the wind pattern will have a significant impact on the Ekman transport in the winddriven upper ocean layer. A numerical model analysispresented by Ludewig (2015) demonstrates that as a result of the disturbance in the wind field, a convergencedivergence dipole of Ekman transport is created (Figure 3.6), which is consistent with the theoretical predictions by Brostrm (2008). The main effects resulting from this dipole are the formation of a surface elevation dipole structure and the related development of upwelling and downwelling cells, which, in turn, induce an excursion of the thermocline in the vicinity of the wind farm.;Figure 3.6 (a) Schematic showing the adjustment of the Ekman transport resulting in upwelling and downwelling. Ekman transport (green arrows) is theoretically deflected by 90 to the right (in the northern hemisphere) of the wind direction (black arrows). As a result of wind wake (light blue area) the Ekman transport is reduced, which causes convergence (CON)divergence (DIV) of water masses and a related change in surface elevation depicted by light grey isolines, in addition to downwelling (X) and upwelling (O). (b) Schematic of conditions on a vertical southnorth crosssection through an offshore windfarm (OWF) affected ocean system. A decline in surface elevation and shallowing of the pycnocline are related to downwelling, with the opposite behaviour generated by upwelling. (After Ludewig 2015);Model simulations under representative conditions have shown that resulting changes in the surface elevation are in order of 0.01 m.
