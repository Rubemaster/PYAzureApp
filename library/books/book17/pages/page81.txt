Chemical contamination relates to the potential unlicensed release of chemicals into the marine, terrestrial or atmospheric environment. The likelihood of release and potential for mitigation are provided in Table 2.2. Note that drill tailings arising from the insertion of a monopile can be licensed for release at authorised disposal sites based on an EIA. Contamination effects are possible during the construction phase of OWFs, such as from accidental pollution incidents. At the time of writing, only two types of such incidents associated with OWF construction have been reported in the OSPAR maritime area, suggesting that such events are rare. Thefirst type was two reported cases of failures in the seal between the turbine transition piece and the pile, resulting in a loss of approximately 30 tonnes of grout that was released under pressure. Regular monitoring of the equipment and instrumentation did not identify the problem, which only became apparent after completion when it was observed that only a small fraction of the grout had entered the transition piece. In both cases, diver inspections after the accident failed to identify grout on the seabed. The grout used was from the OSPAR Harmonised Mandatory Control System list of notified offshore chemicals (OSPAR Commission), so its ecotoxicological properties were known. Furthermore, RenewableUK Guidelines recommend the use of the Offshore Chemical Notification Scheme (Cefas) when hazardous substances are used offshore (RenewableUK 2014). In these two examples, as the incident was limited to a single turbine and the material was apparently rapidly dispersed, the impacts were concluded to be minimal.
