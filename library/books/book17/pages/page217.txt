It is important to acknowledge that the different zones overlap and not all zones may be applicable to a given noise source (Figure 6.3). Behavioural responses may occur over the whole range where noise is audible, although the response is usually related to the loudness. Within the range of audibility of a signal, two zones remain which are to be distinguished azone where hearing impairment and all other effects occur, and a zone where only behavioural and stress responses as well as masking occur.;Figure 6.3 Effect zones of underwater noise in relation to distance to the source and thus received noise levels. PTS and TTS permanent threshold and temporary threshold shifts in hearing, respectively. (Adapted from Gomez et al. 2016);Finally, cumulative effects associated with the construction, operation or decommissioning of multiple OWFs within an effect range of each other are also considered. Monitoring and mitigation of potential impacts fall outside the scope of this chapter, but are considered in further detail by Scheidat and Porter (Chapter 2) and by Thomsen and Verfu (Chapter 7) in Volume 4 of this series.
