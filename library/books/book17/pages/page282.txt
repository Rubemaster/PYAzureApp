Offshore, bats presumably use supporting tailwinds (Hatch et al. 2013 Smith  McWilliams 2016) on a larger scale and correspondingly many may fly much higher, and thus beyond the detection range of all recording equipment, as suggested by Hppop and Hill (2016) for species in the southern North Sea and Hatch et al. (2013) for Eastern Red Bats off the North American east coast,where at least five out of 11 individuals flew at a height of more than 200 m. Onshore, Brazilian Freetailed Bats Tadarida brasiliensis were found feeding in large numbers up to 1,118 m above ground level, with peak activity at 400500 m (McCracken et al. 2008). Radar echoes of dense groups of this species rose to altitudes of more than 3,000 m (Williams et al. 1973). Recordings by bat detectors sent aloft on heliumfilled kite balloons confirm that bats were actively pursuing insects at altitudes of 300800 m (Fenton  Griffin 1997, and several unpublished observations therein), and a thermal camera in southern Sweden revealed that one of the species known to migrate, Common Noctule, forages at altitudes up to 1,200 m (Ahln et al. 2009). In conclusion, it can be assumed that offshore registrations of bat calls are only partly representative of the overall offshore migration of bats, missing possibly stronger migration at altitudes that are beyond the coverage by the available equipment, but well within the area of the rotor blades (Hppop  Hill 2016 Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5).;No technology is available to investigate offshore bat migration at higher altitudes, principally because the use of tethered balloon or kite studies is not feasible at sea and discrimination of single migrating bats from birds by radar is not yet possible (Drake  Reynolds 2012 Aschwanden et al. 2015 Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5). Bat detectors can be installed on top of tall offshore structures, but since at least some bat species are attracted by light during migration (see discussion in Hppop  Hill 2016 Voigt et al. 2017) or change their altitude rapidly when they are near tall vertical obstacles (Ahln et al. 2009 Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5), this would provide only little information on undisturbed migratory flight altitudes. It does, however, emphasise that as for onshore turbines (e.g. Barclay et al. 2017a 2017b), bats may be attracted to offshore wind turbines because of their isolated prominence andor ability to provide stopover resting and perhaps even foraging sites (Pelletier et al. 2013 Peterson et al. 2016). The continued miniaturisation of veryhighfrequency nanotags along with the corresponding deployment of automated radiotelemetry stations has proven ability to track individual bats, as well as small shorebirds and passerines, across portions of their entire migration routes (Smolinsky et al. 2013 Peterson et al. 2014 Hatch 2015
