(With permission of (a) Jan de Nul, HofstadeAalst, Belgium (b) Seatower Wind Turbine Foundations, Glasgow, UK (c) DHI, Hrsholm, Denmark);Offshore wind turbine foundations and the monopile provide habitat throughout the full water column. Natural vertical hard substratum in offshore waters is rare in areas where OWFs are usually constructed, with the prevailing natural hard substratum being either coastal in the form of rocky shores or horizontal in the form of gravel beds. Most wind farms are directly fixed to soft substrata such as sandbanks and mixed sediment areas, and only floating or gravitybase structures could be on hard substrata. Unlike shipwrecks, which are widely distributed in the marine environment, the vertical structure provided by turbines includes intertidal hard substratum, which is rare in offshore waters. Oil and gas, and meteorological platforms provide similar habitat, but these structures are less numerous than offshore wind turbine monopiles.;This new artificial substratum allows for the attachment of epibionts and provides refuges for smaller species against predation (Gutierrez et al. 2003), enhancing the development and colonisation of other species and the growth of a stable benthic community, as demonstrated in Figure 4.3.
