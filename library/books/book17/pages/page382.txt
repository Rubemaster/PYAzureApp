Marques et al. (2014) propose that three interconnected elements influence onshore collision risk (1) speciesspecific factors covering morphology, ecology and behaviour (2) windfarm specific factors and (3) general locational factors. There is no reason to suppose that these factors differ offshore although they are less well understood. The available evidence for seabird collision offshore is therefore reviewed under similar categories below.;The number of flights, the time spent at risk height and flight behaviours that increase bird encounters with turbines are key indicators of seabird collision risk at onshore wind farms. For these reasons, terns experienced the highest collision rates at Zeebrugge (Everaert  Stienen 2007) (Box 9.1). At the same site, Common Tern collision was sex biased, with more males colliding during the egg laying, incubation and early chickrearing period when they undertook a greater number of provisioning flights (Everaert  Kuijken 2007 Everaert  Stienen 2007 Everaert 2008 Stienen et al. 2008). In general, Common Tern collided more frequently than Sandwich Tern and this was attributed to the species more sinuous, less direct flights, which exposed them to risk for longer periods. By contrast, flights of seabirds at Thanet OWF were often nonlinear within the windfarm compared to the straight flight lines assumed by the Band collision risk model. This would effectively reduce flux rate and thus collision estimates (Skov et al. 2018).
