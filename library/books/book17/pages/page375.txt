Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus (Figure 9.1), European Herring Gull Larus argentatus and Common Gull Larus canus. Other gull species included Lesser Blackbacked Gull, Great Blackbacked Gull, Black legged Kittiwake, Yellowlegged Gull Larus michahellis and Mediterranean Gull Ichthyaetus melanocephalus. Other seabirds were Northern Gannet Morus bassanus, Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis, Common Tern Sterna hirundo and Little Tern Sternula albifrons (Painter et al. unpublished data Everaert  Stienen 2007 Everaert 2008 2014). Collisions are generally assumed to have been with the turbine blades, based on the injuries recorded. However, a single collision of a Northern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialis with a turbine tower was observed at the coastal wind farm at Blyth Harbour, UK, in conditions of poor visibility (Newton  Little 2009). The list clearly indicates that gulls and terns are the main species group affected by collisions at onshore and coastal wind farms in this region.;Table 9.1 Seabird species recorded as collision victims at studies of onshore and coastal wind farms and Thanet offshore wind farm.
