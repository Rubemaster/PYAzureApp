Acoustic studies on coastlines, coastal islands, fixed offshore structures such as buoys and platforms, and US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research vessels foundthat bat activity decreased with distance from the North American mainland. However, shipbased surveys documented bat activity up to 130 km off the southern New England coast, with a mean distance of all shipboard calls at 60 km (Peterson et al. 2016). The seasonality of the appearance of certain bat species in Bermuda highlights their extraordinary sense of navigation and their ability to travel regularly distances of more than 1,000 km over open water (Hatch et al. 2013). However, only a few systematic studies enable quantitative conclusions to be reached on the offshore species composition (see examples in Figure 7.5) or the proclivity of individual species to travel over open water. Acoustic surveys conducted off the North American Atlantic coast and Great Lakes found that species differed in their seasonal activity patterns, with Eastern Red Bats detected over an extended period from July to October, Hoary Bats Lasiurus cinereus (Figure 7.6) in midAugust and Silverhaired Bats in early September (Peterson et al. 2016). Eastern Red Bat was the most widespread species (Figure 7.5), occurring at 97 of all locations monitored and accounting for 40 of all identified bat passes. Silverhaired and Hoary Bats were detected in small numbers, but at a high percentage of sites (89 and 95, respectively). Myotis species were detected at some of the most remote sites and were the most commonly identified species group at coastal sites (Peterson et al. 2016). At most offshore sites studied in Europe, Nathusius Pipistrelle was the most often recorded species farther offshore (Figure 7.5).
