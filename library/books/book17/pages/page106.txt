Accordingly, the artificially induced new production around the wind farm would appear to be about the same size as the natural new production in an area that is about ten to 20 times as large as the wind farm. However, the ocean response to a wind farm under realistic conditions needs to be verified and quantified in much more detail. In addition, the ecosystem response to the increased nutrient upwelling may not be linear as assumed here. For example, this increased production can also add to eutrophication and lower oxygen concentrations in deep water, and, hence, have an inverse negative effect on fish productivity. Nevertheless, the calculations indicate that wind farms may induce highly productive areas surrounding the wind farm, which may benefit the local ecosystem and human interests.;Moreover, in addition to the upwelling process itself, disturbances in the thermocline depth will also generate horizontal velocities. For the cases studied by Brostrm (2008), the density induced ocean currents were in the order of 0.30.4 ms. The maximum velocities were located at the wind farm or upwind from the wind farm currents against the wind and waves are known to generate high shortcrested waves that may pose a problem for shipping and maintenance of the wind farm. However, the wake may also induce a selfadvective pattern similar to a smoke ring. This implies that the upwelling and downwelling patterns evolve with time and may spread over large areas, and they may also interact with local currents. As an example, ocean eddies are known to move westwards in an open ocean, although the implication on the dipole eddies found here is unknown. Further studies are needed to quantify how the velocity field will behave and evolve in more realistic situations, and over longer periods.
