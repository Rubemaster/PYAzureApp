Understanding of the physical and chemical effects of monopile and gravitybase turbine installation and operation has increased substantially since the turn of the millennium. Effects from individual foundations and structures have been simulated in numerical models with increasing accuracy. However, understanding of the incombination effects, especially from gravity base, is still being developed.;The spatiotemporal effects are summarised in Table 2.3. This uses a series of confidence ratings derived using the Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership approach, based on a scoring system which combines the amount of evidence available and the level of scientific consensus based on several reviewers (MCCIP).
