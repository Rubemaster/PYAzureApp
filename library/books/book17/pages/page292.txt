Besides direct collision, another potentially dangerous factor for birds and bats flying close to the turbines may be wind wakes of spinning blades (Fox et al. 2006 Kikuchi 2008 Baerwald et al. 2008 Barclay et al. 2017a). These effects are, however, difficult to estimate since they cannot be easily observed directly at night, and offshore, carcasses are difficult to sample for the analysis of proximate mortality causes. In summary, the effects of adverseweather conditions, such as rain or fog, low flight height and illumination may cumulatively result in a higher risk of collision compared with good weather conditions and an absence of illumination (Hppop et al. 2006 2016 Aumller et al. 2011).;Despite a continued evolution of technologies, our current ability to quantify collisions at offshore wind turbines remains a challenge (Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5). The species composition of collision victims found at offshore structures (Box 7.1) frequently differs from that of visual or acoustic observations and from the species composition of fatalities at onshore wind turbines (de Lucas  Perrow 2017), suggesting that some species or groups of species may be more vulnerable to collisions than others. Carcasses found at the research platform FINO 1 were mainly thrushes, Common Starling and other passerines (Hppop et al. 2006 2016), although these species were most prominent within the nocturnal flight call recordings (Figure 7.3).;For nearshore sites, there has been only one study, in Northumberland (northeast England), quantifying the number of fatalities from a beached bird survey (Newton  Little 2009). Over an 11year period, 3,748 beached bird carcasses were found close to the wind farm, but only 3 (114 individuals) of deaths were attributed to wind turbines. The most frequently recorded victims were seabirds European Herring Gulls Larus argentatus (39 individuals), Great Blackbacked Gulls Larus marinus (36), Black headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus (7), and Common Eiders (15) while small passerines were probably underrepresented (Newton  Little 2009).;Virtually nothing is presently known about collisions of bats with artificial offshore structures. Onshore, mortality rates of bats related to wind turbines vary considerably between sites and range from zero to 70 killed bats per turbine per year (Arnett et al. 2008 Rydell et al. 2010a Brinkmann et al. 2011 Barclay et al. 2017a). Regarding the slow life history of bats with relatively long lives, low natural mortality, and low reproduction rates (Barclay  Harder 2003), increased mortality related to wind power poses a serious problem in bat conservation (Kunz et al. 2007 OShea et al. 2016). Mortality of bats at onshore wind turbines is highest during the migratory seasons (Rydell et al. 2010a) and annual mortality
