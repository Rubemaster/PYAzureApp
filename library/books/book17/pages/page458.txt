Figure 10.11 Interannual variation in the abundance (mean1 SEindividuals per 100 m2)of young clupeids, mainly locally spawned youngof theyear (YOY) Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus, captured by a surface tow net within foraging range of Little Tern Sternula albifrons breeding at the North Denes Great Yarmouth Special Protection Area from 20022006 and 2013. The net (0.92  0.3 m opening) was towed over a distance of 1 km at each of four inshore sites on six to eight occasions in each breeding season from May to August inclusive. Data from 2002 contain a backcalculation for missing earlyseason samples derived from the seasonal trend before and after 12 June 2003. Construction of the Scroby Sands wind farm was undertaken from November 2003 to February 2004, and thus 2002 and 2003 represent before (green) and 20042006 represent after (red) construction. Data from 2013 (yellow) are from followup work for Natural England on the impact of the wind farm on Little Terns (Perrow et al. unpublished report, 2013). Insert Catch of young clupeids including translucent YOY among Sea Gooseberries Pleurobrachia pileus in the surface trawl. (Martin Perrow);The Scroby Sands sandbank, around 3 km offshore of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in eastern England, is known to have supported important local colonies of breeding Common Tern Sterna hirundo, Sandwich Tern Thalasseus sandvicensis and Little Tern Sternula albifrons at least from the late 1940s to the mid1960s (Table 10.3). In this period, the bank was mostly emergent at all states of tide, but with some risk of overtopping by high tides, especially in conjunction with strong onshore winds, with disastrous consequences for the breeding birds. In the mid1960s, it seems that the bank started to shrink and was more frequently overtopped, and apparently remained submerged at anything other than low water after 1976.;Table 10.3 Estimated numbers of pairs and estimated productivity (numbers of fledglings in parentheses) of different tern species nesting on Scroby Sands from 1948 to 2018 inclusive. Brief notes on any important factors determining the success of the colony are provided.
