Figure 6.5 Relationship between pile diameter and noise levels expressed as sound exposure level (SEL) and peak level as Lpeak at 750 m from unmitigated offshore pile driving. (Modified from Nehls  Bellmann 2016);Noise immission from offshore pile driving is measured at a standard distance of 750 m according to ISO 184062017 (Robinson  Theobald 2017). At 750 m, noise levels from large piles exceed values of 200 dBpeak and 180 dBSEL.;Underwater noise pressure travels at a speed of 1,480 ms and propagates over large distances. Noise attenuates with increasing distance from the source owing to physical spreading and attenuation in the water column, seafloor and sea surface. The structure of the seafloor and water depth are important variables when modelling noise propagation around a construction site. Wind conditions are also important as, at higher wind speeds, air bubbles from waves in the upper water column attenuate noise (Dragon et al. 2016).
