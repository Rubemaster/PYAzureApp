Offshore wind has come of age since the turn of the millennium and is now a mainstream source of lowcarbon electricity, at least in Europe. Decoupling from subsidy dependence remains key, but rapid technological development and exploitation of ever more favourable generating conditions have vastly improved competitiveness in a very short period. This chapter draws on the personal experience of the authors to address some basic questions What makes an offshore wind farm (OWF)? What are the key components and activities involved? And how is it legislated and regulated? This chapter documents the development and consenting process and outline issues for consenting in a range of different countries in Europe and in key developing markets elsewhere in the world. By necessity, a highlevel approach is adopted as the reality is an assortment of sitespecific and conflicting complexities. The majority of offshore wind developments are sited in European waters, with more than 3,500 turbines concentrated in the North and Baltic Seas contributing close to 14 GW of the 16 GW global total. While, at the time of writing in 2017, the UK is the global leader, Denmark and Germany follow closely behind. Deployments in China and more recently Japan, Taiwan, the Republic of Korea and the USA are increasing. Industry knowledge and experience in project delivery and regulation have had to improve rapidly to
