All structures in the marine environment will be impacted by the local wave regime and, conversely, the structures will modify the wave regime. This is normally demonstrated by a reduction in wave height in the lee of the structure. Both observations using Xband radar (Rees 2006) and numerical modelling studies have identified this process at near field (ABPmer 2005). At far field, modelling studies (SMart Wind 2013 van der Molen et al. 2014) have shown that the footprint can extend beyond the licence area. No direct observations using wavebuoys have yet been undertaken with the aim of measuring the magnitude and shape of any footprint. Satellitebased observations using synthetic aperture radar appear to show wakes behind structures, but the frequency, magnitude and size of these wakes have not yet been established.;Research to quantify the effect of OWF structures on wind driven waves, which propagate towards the coast, was undertaken by Alari and Raudsepp (2012). The main aim was to find out how much wave energy these structures will absorb and scatter. For this, data from two OWFs located in Estonia were used in the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model to assess their potential effects upon wave heights. SWAN is a third generation phaseaveraged spectral wave model developed at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, used extensively in research and by consultancies. The impact of OWFs was assessed by calculating the ratio of difference of significant wave height, with and without wind turbines, to significant wave height without turbines. The authors concluded that the reduction of significant wave height near the coast below 10 m isobaths does not exceed 1. While the potential effects of the reduction of significant wave heights by this order of magnitude on benthic communities have not been assessed, it seems unlikely that these would be significant.
