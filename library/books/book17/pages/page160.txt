The current distribution of, and future plans for, offshore wind farms are likely to influence fish assemblages in coastal waters. In this chapter, the evidence for predicted changes in the fish community as a result of interaction with wind farms is considered, keeping a balance in the analysis that the changes are neither better nor worse ecologically, but will be different owing to the presence of artificial substrate forming habitat. The available evidence focuses on the effects on species, whereas it is also necessary for the species assemblages to be taken into account and, if possible, to translate these into ecological impacts. The effects on fish are linked to changes or responses of biologicalecological relevance and they are impacts only if they are deemed significant in this context. Specific attention is paid to whether specific species or taxa are likely to be sensitive to the environmental emissions associated with windfarm development phases, from preconstruction and construction through operation to decommissioning however, our understanding is patchy. Existing pressures on fish populations such as fishing or habitat degradation are highlighted to provide the appropriate contextual basis, but only as a backdrop against which to interpret the changes associated with wind farms. Overall, the evidence shows that fish are associated with wind farms and there may be important changes to the fish community structure and the trophic interactions within the local marine ecosystem. With the gaps in understanding, the full consequences of windfarm deployment to fish remain unclear. Targeted research to address
