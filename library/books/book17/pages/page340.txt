Figure 8.6 Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo flying in to fish within a wind farm, a common sight in several wind farms in Dutch and UK waters. (Martin Perrow);Another species showing quite consistent attraction to OWFs is Great Blackbacked Gull. Five of out eight studies report moderate to strong attraction, while three studies found no evidence of post construction changes in the atsea distribution of this species. Attraction of Great Blackbacked Gulls was found over a wide regional scale, including Belgian, Dutch and German offshore waters (Leopold et al. 2013 Welcker  Nehls 2016 Vanermen et al. 2016 2017).;As Great Cormorants need to dry their feathers in between foraging bouts, the presence of abovewater constructions is a critical precondition to their being able to forage offshore for longer periods. As such, birds are now present in areas that were previously inaccessible, often resulting in very distinct increases and distributional concentrations (Leopold et al. 2013). At the Thornton Bank OWF, the majority of Great Cormorants was observed roosting on the turbine foundations (89), with a clear preference for outer rather than inner turbines.
