Figure 2.4 (a) Potential turbine footprint for a monopile in highly erodiblesediment (b) a typical gravitybased structure.;The investigations at Scroby Sands OWF (DECC  Defra 2008) also showed that scour pits for monopiles at the site were independent of one another that is, there was no connectivity between any two scour pits within a windfarm array (Figure 2.5). To optimise utilisation of wind resources, turbines within a wind farm have often been spaced between approximately 500 m and 1,000 m apart, although larger designs of 7 MW capacity will increase this figure to 2,000 m or more. This suggests that with the relatively wide spacing of turbines required for efficient electricity generation, scouring impacts are likely to remain localised and not merge into continuous areas of disturbance, but instead remain as discrete and small areas separated by large areas of relatively undisturbed seabed.;Figure 2.5 Scroby Sands offshore wind farm sediment transport features as produced by Rees (2006). The insert demonstrates where secondary scouring occurred around the scour protection, which led to further control measures being adopted (see Box 10.3).;Although the scour pits at Scroby Sands OWF have been shown to be independent of one another, Rees (2006) identified scour tails in the more exposed areas (Figure 2.5). Such effects are likely to be limited to the near field around the OWF array as the impacts on seabed sediments due to additional mobility and translocation of sediments are limited to within a few hundred metres of the wind farm array (DECC  Defra 2008).
