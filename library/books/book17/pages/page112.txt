Figure 3.7 Comparison between (a) measured and (b) simulated temperature distributions around the Alpha Ventus offshore wind farm. (a) Measured conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD)temperature profiles around Alpha Ventus in the four different sections (b) results from the Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM). Black dotted vertical lines mark the borders of the wind farm and black dashed lines accentuate the vertical temperature structure for comparison with the HAMSOM results. Results are presented for 12 May, corresponding to 3 days of simulation with constant wind forcing. (After Ludewig 2015);General theoretical arguments suggest that the response of ocean dynamics will increase quickly with the size of the wind wake, which in turn depends on the size of the wind farm (Brostrm 2008). In other words, size matters when evaluating the impact on the ecosystem, although more precise estimates of the response for different wind speeds and turning of wind direction are required before accurate predictions on the ecosystem can be made. Possible changes in species composition and ecosystem functioning may also be crucial for evaluating the likely ecosystem response. Nonetheless, some estimates can be provided from the current knowledge base.
