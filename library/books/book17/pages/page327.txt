Figure 8.2 Map showing the estimated beforeafter changes in Long tailed Duck Clangula hyemalis numbers across the Nysted offshore windfarm study area in Danish waters (see inset), as derived from a spatially adaptive generalised additive model.;Another widely adopted approach is the beforeafter control impact (BACI) design. In OWF displacement studies, the extent of the survey area in a BACI setup is typically smaller than in BAG studies. Samples are taken before and after windfarm construction, in and around the OWF as well as in an undisturbed control area. The BACI approach assumes that naturally occurring changes will appear in both the control and impact sites (Oedekoven et al. 2013). In the case of no windfarm effect, the trends in numbers of both areas are therefore expected to run parallel and any trend deviation between the impact and control areas is attributed to the presence of the OWF (Box 8.2). It is therefore very important for any underlying and explanatory variables driving the response variable
