A productivity model was developed based on density and size structure data of fish recorded by annual observations between 5 and 15 years at each site. The total secondary production was made up of what the authors termed somatic and recruitment production, which predicted biomass in the subsequent year based on species growth and mortality and postlarvaljuvenile growth and production, respectively (fordetails see Claisse et al. 2014). The productivity metric was then scaled per square metre of seabed for each entire platform surveyed.;While neither oil and gas platforms nor OWFs were designed with fish productivity in mind, Claisse et al. (2014) clearly show that the fish community associated with the platform significantly increased the local productivity, for all platform types, compared with the natural rocky reefs inhabited by the fish concerned (Figure 5.12). The principal reason for this huge boost in local productivity is considered to be a result of the large increase in availability of structural habitat for different fish species and different life stages for a small number of dominant species. The authors suggest that their estimates may be conservative, as recruitment variability will play a large role in determining secondary production over time. They highlight that it is necessary to understand the local and regional oceanography responsible for larval fish delivery in relation to how the location of a structure will influence fish production.
