Figure 5.2 Theoretical zones of acoustic influence of a sound source (such as pile driving) on fish with distance. The source is depicted at the centre and the reduction in multifrequency propagation of the sound is represented by the reduction in coloured arrows with distance. Higher frequencies (1,000 Hz) have limited emission range whereas lowfrequency sounds (100 Hz) dominate at a distance. (Modified from Gill et al. 2012a);EMFs are emitted into the local environment mainly from subsea cables as a result of wind turbines generating electricity (Gill et al. 2012b Thomsen et al. 2015). There are two main types of cable highvoltage alternating current (HVAC) and highvoltage direct current (HVDC). Both types emit magnetic fields into the surrounding environment and HVAC also directly induces electric fields within the adjacent seawater (Figure 5.3). Furthermore,
