Globally, there are about nine major bird flyways, or general flight paths of migrating birds, connecting the northern and southern hemispheres (BirdLife International 2010). A flyway encompasses the whole life cycle of a migratory bird (Boere  Stroud 2006). Although originally developed for waterbirds, the flyway concept is generally useful for the study and description of bird migration (BirdLife International 2010). All flyways include large bodies of marine water (Figure 7.1). In the Western Palaearctic, the most prominent flyway is the East Atlantic flyway (red in Figure 7.1), which links a discontinuous band of breeding grounds, stretching in the Arctic from eastern Canada to Siberia, as well as over central, northern, and western Europe, with the nonbreedingareas in Europe on to southern Africa (BirdLife International 2010). The Wadden Sea forms a particularly important key stopover site for waterbirds migrating along this flyway (Boere  Piersma 2012).;Figure 7.1 Main bird migration flyways. The movements of migrating birds follow a predominantly northsouth axis linking geographically distinct breeding and nonbreeding areas. (After Boere  Stroud 2006 BirdLife International 2010 Map BigMap by OpenStreetMaps);A few birds from the high American Arctic are also part of the huge East Atlantic flyway but most North American bird species utilise a system of three different American flyways, again in huge numbers. Some will avoid following the Central American land bridge and instead directly cross the open Gulf of Mexico (Atlantic American flyway, light blue in Figure 7.1). The East Asian Australasian flyway encompasses large parts of East Asia and extends from Arctic Russia and North America to the southern limits of Australia and New Zealand (yellow in Figure 7.1), with over 50 million migratory waterbirds, including 8 million waders.
