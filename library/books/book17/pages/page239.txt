Furthermore, a significant increase in Harbour Porpoise activity inside the operational site, relative to the baseline conditions at the Dutch OWF Egmond aan Zee (Scheidat et al. 2011 Lindeboom et al. 2011), may have been due to a reef effect resulting from prey aggregations around turbine bases. However, the pattern observed could equally suggest potential for a refuge effect from nearby shipping lanes, consistent with the general impression that Harbour Porpoise tends to avoid or at least not be attracted to vessels (see Effects of service vessels, above).;In relation to seals, Russell et al. (2014) present telemetry data suggesting that both Grey and Harbour Seals trace underwater windfarm infrastructure as well as other anthropogenic structures, such as pipelines. An example of the tracks of one Harbour Seal that visited Sheringham Shoal wind farm in each of its of 13 foraging trips from haulouts over 30 km away in the Greater Wash is shown in Figure 6.11. This clearly shows movements consistent with foraging activity directly between turbine bases, many of which (77 of the 90 present) have extensive rocky scour protection extending up to 11 m from the bases. Harbour Seals in the Wash are known to take a range of prey, from small demersal fish to crabs (Hall et al. 1998). The latter are abundant in the site, judging by the successful pot fishery for Edible Crab Cancer pagurus and European Lobster Homarus gammarus that operates around and within the wind farm. The telemetry study reinforced the regular observation of both Harbour and Grey Seals (Figure 6.12) within the operational wind farm during detailed ornithological studies (see Harwood et al. 2017).
