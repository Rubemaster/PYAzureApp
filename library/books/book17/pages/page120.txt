J. DANNHEIM, S. DEGRAER, M. ELLIOTT, K. SMYTH and J.C. WILSON;This review of published and unpublished information demonstrates that offshore wind farms (OWFs) have major effects on the benthos that is, the seabed flora and fauna. By adding artificial hard substrata to the marine ecosystem, OWFs create new habitat for colonising benthic species, allowing attachment and attraction of hardsubstratum species, in the artificial reef effect. The general exclusion of fisheries further creates flourishing softsediment benthic communities. Although wind farms hardly extend the distribution range of hardsubstratum species, they may be stepping stones for nonindigenous species. Such an increase in benthic diversity, however, is countered by the loss of, disturbance to and or alteration of the natural seabed. Despite this, it may be concluded that OWFs create local hotspots of benthic diversity, directly influencing the local marine food web. During construction, the biomass of forage species decreases, affecting predatory and scavenging species negatively and positively, respectively. Mobile predatory species tend to leave the area during construction. Once installed, the flourishing benthic communities greatly increase in benthic foraging species and attract predators. The surrounding natural sediments are affected by the deposition of organic matter from the epibionts on the turbine monopoles and scour protection and by the altered predator community. Given that a new ecological equilibrium in the benthic system will develop over 2030 years, it is arguable whether a return to the preconstruction state following
