JON M. REES and ADRIAN D. JUDD;This chapter examines how offshore wind farms (OWFs) may cause changes to the prevailing hydrodynamic and coastal processes, including changes to seabed morphology and sediment transport and to water and sediment quality. Physical effects can be attributed to the physical presence of OWF infrastructure and the techniques used to install these structures. Chemical effects can be attributed to the substances such as biocides, corrosion inhibitors and cements used in construction and maintenance. Both physical and chemical effects have the potential to affect habitats and species. Here, evidence from both grey and peerreviewed literature is used to describe the nature and scale of any effects, both individually and cumulatively. Different foundation designs using monopile and gravitybased structures provide two extreme scenarios. Despite a limited body of evidence, understanding of the physical and chemical impacts of monopile and gravitybased structures of individual OWFs is reasonably sound. Material is divided between themes exploring physical processes and local changes to seabed conditions, including scour and scour protection, cabling and cable protection and chemicals. Effects characterised from observations, models and measurements may be split into construction, operation and decommissioning phases. This evidence shows that physical effects are predominantly in the near field for tides, sediment transport and chemical factors that is, within one spring tidal ellipse of the structure supporting the turbine. In contrast, wave modelling studies have shown that impacts can
