OWFs have defined periods during which the changes to the marine environment that may affect fish will differ, namely the pre construction surveying and construction, operation and decommissioning phases (level 1 in the environmental effects framework in Figure 5.1). The preconstructionconstruction and the decommissioning phases are expected to have the strongest influence on fish in terms of acute, shortterm effects (Figure 5.1), as they represent the greatest amount of structural and habitat change, and are the busiest periods in terms of boat traffic and the noisiest times over periods of several months. However, more interest is emerging in the longterm operational phase (2030 years), where the structures represent new habitat and environmental attributes which are likely to cause some response in the fish over time through chronic, longterm effects (Figure 5.1). Furthermore, in thisphase the wind energy is harnessed and converted into electrical energy and some of the harnessed energy is emitted acoustically, electromagnetically and thermally into the surrounding environment, which leads to specific effectorreceptoreffect pathways and predicted outcomes (Figure 5.1, levels 24) (Boehlert  Gill 2010). The effects will be evidenced by responses in fish and are determined as impacts (Figure 5.1, level 6) if they significantly alter fish population or community attributes either directly (Figure 5.1, levels 46, hatched arrows) or through cumulative or in combination effects (Figure 5.1, levels 46).;Figure 5.1 Framework of the main environmental effectors and receptors for the three phases of offshore windfarm development. Each level feeds into the next and shows potential outcomes in the form of demonstrable effects over different scales and how these effects can manifest as biologically and ecologically relevant impacts, either directly (hatched arrows) or via cumulative andor incombination effects.
