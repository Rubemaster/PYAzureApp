Figure 1.9 Intertidal cable installation at Ormonde on the English west coast. (Tony West);Voltage must be stepped up between the generating station and grid connection point, as onshore transmission and distribution networks typically operate at voltages upwards of 132 kV. Most OWFs will have one or more offshore substation platforms housing transformers and other electrical equipment. The number of platforms is often dependent on the size of the wind farm and the distance to shore. In cases where a wind farm is located close to shore (meaning several kilometres as opposed to tens of kilometres) and electrical losses over distance are minimised, offshore transformation may not be required at all and electricity can be directly transmitted to shore at the interarray cable voltage. For example, Vesterhav Nord and Syd in Denmark and the Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm in the UK are taking this approach. Sites utilising HVDC transmission have generally had more platforms, as they require converter platforms offshore as well as collector platforms. Platforms may also house accommodation for personnel working offshore and include the means of transfer by helicopter (Figure 1.10) andor transfer vessels. Again, this tends to be for sites farther offshore. Each site has unique requirements and therefore the number and configuration of platforms will be site specific.
