The majority of offshore wind developments are sited in European coastal waters, with the North and Baltic Seas contributing close to 14 GW of a total of nearly 16 GW worldwideat the time of writing in 2017 (Figure 1.1). In fact, the most recent statistics show Europes cumulative offshore wind capacity actually reached 15.78 GW from 4,149 gridconnected turbines in 92 wind farms across 11 countries (Wind Europe 2018). The UK is the global leader in offshore wind, followed by Germany and then Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium. Outside European offshore wind markets, significant deployments in China and more recently Japan, Taiwan, the Republic of Korea and the USA are gathering pace (see Consenting process and issues below) and taking an increasing share (Figure 1.1). Advances in the commercialisation of floating offshore wind are enabling countries with deep water, such as Japan and the USA (on the west coast and California in particular) to consider a new frontier for deployment.;Figure 1.1 Cumulative European Union (EU) and rest of the World (RoW) or nonEU installed offshore wind capacity in megawatts from 1991 to 2017. (Renewables Consulting Group 2017);The main benefit of offshore wind energy is the ability to deploy larger turbines in greater numbers, where wind resource is more favourable than onshore. There are, however, drawbacks when it comes to some installation and operational activities that have required adaptation owing to the harsher conditions experienced offshore. Moreover, as projects become located farther offshore, the cost escalates as larger foundations are required for deeper water, transit times to and from the wind farm increase, the weather
