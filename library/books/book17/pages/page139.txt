Figure 4.6 Turbine bases typically attract a range of predatory fish species that feed on invertebrates and smaller fish associated with epifaunal growth, although dietary studies suggest that the attraction of pelagic species such as these Horse Mackerel Trachurus trachurus is not linked to improved foraging conditions. (WG Ecosystem Functions, Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research);Organic enrichment has been demonstrated for softbottom sediments adjacent to turbine monopiles (Joschko 2007 Coates et al. 2014), favouring the occurrence of deposit and suspension feeders and a shift in the trophic structure of the surrounding community. For example, Coates et al. (2014) demonstrated an increase of the polychaete worms Lanice conchilega and Spiophanes bombyx up to 25 m from the platform. On the one hand, these tube building polychaetes have the potential to enhance the changes in hydrodynamic flow, grainsize distribution and food availability (Coates et al. 2014) by collecting organic matter, stabilising the sediment and increasing habitat complexity for other species as a
