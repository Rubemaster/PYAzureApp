Most knowledge on the response to pile driving originates from studies on Harbour Porpoise in the North Sea. The first OWFs in Denmark and Germany caused effects on Harbour Porpoise over a large range. Reduced porpoise activity was recorded up to a distance of about 20 km during and shortly after piling (Tougaard et al. 2009a Brandt et al. 2011 Haelters et al. 2012 Dhne et al. 2013 Diederichs et al. 2014). This corresponds with the suggestion of Bailey et al. (2010) that behavioural disturbance of Bottlenose Dolphins could similarly occur over large distances (up to 50 km) in relation to the piledriving of two 5 MW turbines installed in the Moray Firth in northeast Scotland. However, the early projects involving Harbour Porpoise were constructed without noise mitigation and additional aspects of the construction work may have contributed to the strong response. For example, at Alpha Ventus OWF in Germany, piles were first vibrated up to 9 m into the substrate before being piled with a hydraulic hammer, using between 11,383 and 25,208 strokes lasting for 376802 minutes to install some piles to a depth of 30 m. Piledriving measurements employing a gradient design with acoustic monitoring equipmentspaced along a transect away from the impact area were conducted during installation of one pile. A shortramp procedure was employed with a duration of about 5 minutes, after which 449 blows over 30 minutes were utilised to penetrate to a depth of 21 m. Piling generated peak levels at 720 m from the pile of 196 dB re 1 Pa, while the SEL, as defined in Box 6.3, reached a maximum of 176 dB re 1 Pa 2s (Dhne et al. 2013). In keeping with the results from other studies, Brandt et al. (2011) found that porpoise acoustic activity fell by 100 in the hour after pile driving and did not return to normal for between 24 and 72 hours at a distance of 2.6 km from the site, with recovery time reducing with distance. An impact was detectable to 17.8 km from the site, but was not detectable at 22 km where activity increased. Up to around 5 km from the site, recovery times tended to exceed pauses in piling.;An important aspect of the response of Harbour Porpoise to anthropogenic noise is that the response becomes weaker with decreasing noise levels. In a detailed study using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) during the construction of 40 tripod foundations at the Trianel Borkum wind farm in the German North Sea, Diederichs et al. (2014) related the strength and duration of porpoise response to piledriving noise levels. Reduced porpoise activity was recorded up to a noise level of 144 dB SEL. The response at 144 dB SEL was, however, rather weak and a marked reduction in activity, probably representing strong to full displacement, was evident at noise levels above 152 dB SEL (Figure 6.6)
