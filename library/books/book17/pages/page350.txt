Importantly, a displacement effect is not synonymous with a displacement impact (Masden et al. 2010a). In an OWF context, the effect is often a decreased number of birds in the windfarm footprint area due to an avoidance response, whereas the actual impact could be a change in population size resulting from a chain of consequences following the initial avoidance. Figure 8.10 shows a schematic overview of the expected ecological consequences of displacement and their eventual impact resulting from the two possible avoidance responses (1) barriers to movement and (2) displacement from an ideal foragingfeeding distribution.;Figure 8.10 Flowchart summarising the ecological consequences resulting from the two main avoidance responses at offshore wind farms. The green boxes indicate potentially measurable effects while the red boxes indicate processes that need to be modelled. (Adapted from Fox et al. 2006)
