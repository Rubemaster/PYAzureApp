The introduction of monopiles and erosion protection, which are quickly colonised by an epifouling community, add additional benthic producers and consumers to the marine ecosystem (e.g. Wolfson et al. 1979 Lindeboom et al. 2011 Krone et al. 2013a). These species thus serve as additional prey items for higher trophic levels such as benthic and benthopelagic fish, including Pouting and Atlantic Cod (Maar et al. 2009 Reubens et al. 2011 Bergstrm et al. 2013), or larger invertebrates such as crabs, which accumulate around the artificial structures (Krone et al. 2013b) (Box 4.3). At the same time, the accumulation of larger benthic predators can increase the predation pressure on the surrounding softbottom communities by selectively removing those species with biological traits which make them susceptible to predation, for example mobile crustaceans which leave the sediment if disturbed (Bergstrm et al. 2013).;On a local scale within the Belgian part of the North Sea, during a fouryear study, specific age groups of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua and Pouting Trisopterus luscus were shown to be seasonally attracted towards offshore wind farms, showing high site fidelity (Reubens et al. 2013 Reubens et al., Box 5.1, Chapter 5). The fish fed upon the dominant epifaunal prey species present (Figure 4.5) and growth was observed throughout the period for which the fish were present, indicating extra biological production on a local scale (Reubens et al. 2013). However, not all fish species may benefit from these hotspots for instance, stomach content analysis shows
