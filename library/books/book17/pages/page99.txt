To illustrate the calculation, a wind speed of 10 ms will create a surface current of about 0.2 ms. The total volume transport is often called the Ekman transport (M) and for a wind in the xdirection it is in the negative ydirection according towhere x is the wind stress on the surface (Nm2),  is the density of water (e.g. 1,000 kgm3), and f is the Coriolis parameter, which varies with latitude but is about 1.2104s at 60N.;The wind stress at the surface can then be estimated aswhere A is the density of air (e.g. 1.25 kgm3), CD (1.510;3) is a drag coefficient, and U10 is the wind speed at 10 m height. As example, a wind stress of 10 ms gives 0.19 Nm2 and a wind speed of 20 ms gives a wind stress of roughly 0.75 Nm2.;Thus, for a wind speed of 10 ms the transport is about 1.5 m2s, that is 1.5 m3sm. If the wind speed varies horizontally, the transport in the upper layer will also vary in the horizontal. This is called a divergent flow field. The volume is essentially conserved and there must be a compensating vertical flow if the horizontal flow in the surface layer is divergent. An extreme example is a coastal area with wind that is directed along the coast. Depending on the direction of the wind, upwelling of deep water or downwelling of surface water will result. In many places the climatological wind is such that upwelling prevails, such as in Peru, California, Portugal and the western Sahara, all areas known for their rich marine life and fisheries fuelled by the nutrients in the upwelled water.;The fact that wind farms extract wind energy implies that the wind stress behind the wind farm is reduced, which induces a divergent Ekman transport in the upper ocean. The consequence is that offshore wind farms will generate upwelling and downwelling patterns in their vicinity. The exact response in the ocean to a divergent Ekman flow field depends on the size of the disturbance in the flow field and the natural response scales in the ocean. This is discussed in Box 3.3.
