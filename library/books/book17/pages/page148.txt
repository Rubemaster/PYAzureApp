As shown here, the construction of wind farms gives the potential for habitat management and enhancement of the seabed and, if managed correctly, there is the potential for the introduction of, and change to, habitats to produce positive effects (Wilson  Elliott 2009 Wilson et al. 2010). An increased local biodiversity is one of the most commonly reported impacts of OWFs (Gutow et al. 2014 Lindeboom et al. 2015). However, should OWFs be installed in areas with poor management and consideration for the receiving environment, then the introduction of hard substratum may result in habitat loss.;This review has indicated that benthic communities will develop on the installed hard structures and could redevelop, perhaps with an entirely different community structure, if those hard structures were removed at the end of the life of the wind farm. These trajectories may reflect similar ones for the benthos around and on other anthropogenic structures for which there is a large body of information (Elliott et al. 2007 Gray  Elliott 2009 Borja et al.
