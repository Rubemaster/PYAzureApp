Where seabirds avoid wind farms during both construction and operation they cannot collide with the infrastructure. Studies in the Dutch North Sea estimated that 28 of all birds avoided the wind farm entirely (Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Petersen et al. 2006). Vanermen and Stienen discuss avoidance and displacement from thewindfarm footprint in detail in Chapter 8 in this volume. However, in terms of collision risk, it is important to understand both the scale and rate of avoidance so it can be incorporated into the calculation of avoidance rates for collision risk modelling (Cook  Masden, Volume 4, Chapter 6).;Consistently high macroavoidance rates have been recorded for Northern Gannet (Garthe et al. 2017) estimated at 64 and 85 in Dutch and Belgian wind farms respectively (Krijgsveld et al. 2011 Vanermen et al. 2015) and Skov et al. (2018) calculated an empirical macroavoidance rate of 79.7 at Thanet, UK. Gull species at Horns Rev and Nysted, Denmark, avoided the wind farm at rates between 56 and 61 (Skov et al. 2012), although at some wind farms they still provide the bulk of local flight activity (Fijn et al. 2015) but not necessarily at preconstruction densities (Vanermen et al. 2017). At Thanet, there was variation in empirical avoidance rates between species with European Herring Gull and Great Blackbacked Gull at 44.2 and 46.4 respectively and Lesser Blackbacked Gull at 61.9. Blacklegged Kittiwake was intermediate at 56.6 (Skov et al. 2018). These relatively low rates meant that macroavoidance contributed least to overall collision risk. During the construction of Sheringham Shoal, visual tracking showed that 30 of Sandwich Terns avoided the wind farm completely, compared to preconstruction, and although post construction utilisation increased, birds tended to transit the site rather than forage within it (Harwood et al. 2017). Macro avoidance also occurs at night, particularly by birds on migration (see Huppop et al., Chapter 7), although different wind farms have recorded different behaviours, some seabirds avoiding by lesser and some by greater distance during darkness (Krijgsveld et al. 2011). At Thanet, night time activity within the wind farm was less than 3 of that recorded during the day (Skov et al. 2018) although whether this represents macroavoidance or simply low levels of nocturnal activity is not known.
