A range of activities have the potential to affect physical process, including the installation and presence of infrastructure, benthic trawling, navigation dredging, subsea cables, marine aggregateextraction, coastal protection and flood risk management. The individual effects on physical processes associated with these activities have the potential to interact with each other. The magnitude, duration and spatial extent of physical effects will be dictated by the prevailing physical environmental conditions with the tidal excursion of the development, including tidal speed, tidal direction, wave height, wind speed, vertical stratification, substrate type, substrate cohesiveness and seabed morphology. These local conditions also control which of these parameters will interact and how they will interact in combination. For example, the concentration of suspended sediments in a plume may increase if concurrent cable laying, foundation drilling, dredging and scouring are all occurring in the same tidal axis within the same tidal excursion or habitat changes result from the combination of foundation installation, scouring, anchoring, dredging, placement of scour protection and cable installation.;As such, incombination effects on physical processes may be split into two distinct typologies (1) effects accumulating within the same local spatial and temporal footprint, such as suspended sediments and (2) effects accumulating at a large number of discrete locations, such as scour pits, which, while they do not overlap, may contribute to an overall adverse effect. The suite of in combination effects from one wind farm may then add to another in sufficiently close proximity as a cumulative effect across sites.;Modelling undertaken as part of the EIAs for OWFs generally predicts that the risks of incombination and cumulative effects on physical and chemical processes are low. However, the methods and monitoring do not yet have the power to measure accurately the full range of effects on marine ecosystems.
