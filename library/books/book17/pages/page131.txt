Several floral and faunal zones can hence be distinguished on windturbine foundations, from intertidal sessile taxa such as green, brown and red algae, barnacles (e.g. Semiblananus spp. and Balanus spp.) and Blue Mussels Mytilus edulis in northwestern Europe (Figure 4.4) and Mytilus galloprovincialis in the Mediterranean, to subtidal communities dominated by mobile crustaceans (amphipods, cumaceans and isopods) and anemones such as Metridium spp. (Kerckhof et al. 2010 Krone et al. 2013a de Mesel et al. 2015). Given these changes, the introduction of new and different habitat types leads to an increased local biodiversity, which is one of the most commonly reported changes due to OWFs (Gutow et al. 2014 Lindeboom et al. 2015). At the German wind farm Alpha Ventus, the abundance of macroinvertebrates was 100times higher on the foundations just 2 years after construction compared to the surrounding seabed, with over 2,000 Edible Crabs Cancer pagurus inhabiting single foundations compared to 29 in reference areas (Krone  Krgefsky 2013). At a windfarm scale, sessile macrofaunal species richness, for example, may increase considerably, perhaps in the order of 314fold (Rumes et al. 2013). The sessile macrofaunal community composition, however, seems impoverished from that expected on natural hard substrata in similar oceanographic conditions. In North Sea waters, the vertical structures especially tend to be dominated by only a few species, such as the amphipod Jassa herdmani, the plumose anemone Metridium senile, the hydroids Tubularia spp. and the Blue Mussel M. edulis, while J. herdmani proved to be less prevalent on the erosion protection layers (e.g. de Mesel et al. 2013, 2015).;Figure 4.4 Algae, barnacles and blue mussels dominate the intertidal zone of the wind turbine foundations.
