Overall, there has been rather little research on the impacts of construction upon seabirds, partly as several key studies in European waters, such as those by Lindeboom et al. (2011), Leopold et al. (2013) and Vanermen et al. (2015a 2015b), were unable to monitor during the construction phase. In contrast, there has been no restriction on monitoring during construction at some sites in the UK. At Sheringham Shoal, displacement of passing and wintering Razorbill Alca torda began during the initial construction phase (Figure 10.2 and Figure 10.3), affecting not only the site, but also the nearby control and buffer (to 4 km) areas (Figure 10.3). Thereafter, while there was no obvious recovery within the site, including into the operational period, numbers of birds recovered both in the control area and in the buffer areas, especially at 24 km from the site (Figure 10.3). The pattern at Sheringham Shoalmirrors the preconstruction to postconstruction (operational) displacement of auks including Common Guillemot Uria aalge at several sites reviewed by Vanermen  Stienen in Chapter 8 (Figure 10.4). At Robin Rigg, however, numbers of Common Guillemot remained similar across all construction phases (Vallejo et al. 2017). The difference may be that here, birds were also present during the breeding season as a result of the proximity of breeding colonies. The fact that breeding birds are tied to centralplace foraging restricts their options for foraging sites, from which they may not be readily displaced. Similarly, the breeding status of Sandwich Terns (Harwood et al. 2017) and Lesser Blackbacked Gulls (Thaxter et al. 2018) may have contributed to their lack of strong or consistent avoidance of the wind farms routinely encountered on foraging trips from their colonies although these aerial foraging species tend to show an indifferent or inconsistent response to wind farms.
