Pettersson (2005) commented that few waterfowl migrated under fog and mist (56), broadly corresponding with the periods during which these conditions occurred (59), and the flocks migrated in the same way as they did under good conditions. Plonczkier  Simms (2012) ran radar for 24 hours a day over a range of weather conditions for 3846 days in each of 4 years during the autumn migration period. They noted that 85 of the 979 flocks of geese (571 visually confirmed as Pinkfooted Geese comprising 39,957 individuals) migrated by day. Of these, only 14 diurnal flights were recorded when visibility was perceived to be poor. Although these were at lower height (100150 m) than normal (250300 m) under such conditions and thus at more risk of turbine strike, Plonczkier  Simms (2012) concluded that this represented a negligible increase in the risk to the population as a whole. For nocturnally migrating waterfowl, Desholm  Kahlert (2005) had previously demonstrated that although flocks of migrating Common Eider and geese were more likely to enter the Nysted wind farm at night, they counteracted any risk by increasing the distance to individual turbines, demonstrating that they could see andor sense the presence of the turbines and react accordingly.;The behaviour of individuals is thought to be a key factor contributing to collision, and Smallwood (2017), mainly in relation to raptors, concluded that collision is often linked to territorial clashes and general distraction by conspecifics and any mobbing individuals. The sexbiased mortality of Common Tern Sterna hirundo during the egglaying and incubation periods at Zeebrugge was thought to be the result of the higher foraging activity of males in order to provision their mates during these periods, thereby exposing them to wind turbines (Stienen et al. 2008 Everaert  Stienen, Chapter 9, Box 9.1). Ultimately, Smallwood (2017) suggested that surveys are best focused on behaviour rather than conventional utilisation rate. The latter distilled to the number of passages (flux) through the area of risk is generally the key descriptor of collision risk modelling (Smales 2017). This may partly explain why EIA based on predictions of collision risk modelling may be only weakly correlated with actual collision rate once the site is built (Ferrer et al. 2012), although there are other cases where the two are comparable (Smales 2017).
