Barrington (1900) analysed data collected at Irish lighthouses and lightships from 1891 to 1897. From 1894 onwards, lightkeepers were to cut off and forward a leg and wing of any bird that was killed striking the lanterns. This resulted in almost 1,600 samples, with Common Blackbird Turdus merula (n148), Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus (n142), Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis (n130), Song Thrush Turdus philomelos (n118), Common Whitethroat Sylvia communis (n109), Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe (n89), Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus (n82) and Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris (n80) being the most numerous species.;Almost simultaneously, Rudolf Blasius started a systematic longterm survey on collisions at German lighthouses and lightvessels along the coasts of the North Sea and Baltic Sea. During the first 10 years of these studies (Blasius 18931894) at least 12,737 birds were killed, more regularly in autumn than in spring. Collision victims were predominantly Eurasian Skylarks (n3,208), Common Starlings (n2,728), thrushes Turdus spp. (n1,961), European Robins Erithacus rubecula (n1,726) and other songbirds.;Hansen (1954) compiled lots of data on birds killed at Danish lights from 1886 to 1939. In total, 40,700 individuals from 170 species were recorded as collision victims. Again, songbirds were by far the most numerous group (n22,718), with Eurasian Skylarks equalling 55.8 of all fatalities.
