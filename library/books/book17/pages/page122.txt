All human activities in the marine environment have the potential, by their very nature, to affect its natural structure and functioning. Because of both the direct effects on the seabed and the intimate links between the water column and benthos (Gray  Elliott 2009), the seabed will always be directly or indirectly affected. The effects of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on seabed communities comprise one of the most important elements when considering the potential impacts of such developments, due to the inevitability of effects arising, especially from monopiles bored into the substratum or gravity bases supported on the seabed, their surrounding erosion protection layer and the installation of cable routes (Wilson et al. 2010) (Figure 4.1). Even developments in floating wind technology still require anchor points and the connection of associated infrastructure, such as interarray and export cables (e.g. Butterfield et al. 2005 Statoil ASA 2017 see Chapter 1 in this volume). Therefore, an understanding of the waysin which seabed communities are affected by OWFs is vital, in part, so that appropriate mitigation measures can be identified and deployed.;Figure 4.1 Different types of wind turbine foundation.
