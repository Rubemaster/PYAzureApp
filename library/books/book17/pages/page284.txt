In general, avoidance rates strongly depend on external conditions (Chamberlain et al. 2006). During the day and under good visibility, flocks of migrating seaducks and geese actively change their flight path at a distance of at least 12 km to avoid entering a wind farm (Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Pettersson 2005 Petersen et al. 2006 Krijgsveld et al. 2011). At Kalmarsund (Baltic Sea), this avoidance behaviour led to displacement in the overall migration pattern of waterfowl by about 2 km after construction of the wind farm (Pettersson 2005). Deviations from the migratory trajectories, however, result in an increase in flight distance and thus in energy expenditure, although avoiding one wind farm will not seriously increase energy expenditure. Masden et al. (2009) measured the detour taken by Common Eiders Somateria mollissimawhen facing a single wind farm in the Baltic Sea. The estimated length of the additional flight path was about 500 m, a distance which seems to be negligible considering a total migration route of 1,400 km (Masden et al. 2009). However, if birds encounter multiple wind farms, the cumulative energy expenditure sums up (Fox et al. 2006 Masden et al. 2009). In their example, Masden et al. (2009) calculated that for 100 detours, the energetic costs could sum up to 1 of a birds body mass. Bearing in mind that, at dawn, nocturnally migrating birds reorient under some circumstances towards land (Bruderer  Liechti 1998 Smolinsky et al. 2013 Archibald et al. 2017), the additional energetic costs when re encountering the same offshore or nearshore wind farm several times within one season may not be negligible.;The extent of a detour that passing birds have to make also depends on the distance of the wind farms to each other and on the configuration of the individual wind farms, which influences their permeability (Hppop et al. 2006 Masden et al. 2012). According to movement models, diamondshaped wind farms properly aligned to the birds flight routes had a low permeability, which reduced the risk of collision, and modelled lengths of flown detours were relatively small (Masden et al. 2012).;During the night, birds migrating over the sea are more prone to enter an OWF (Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Krijgsveld et al. 2011 Schulz et al. 2014), although the proportion of birds actually entering a wind farm is generally low, at least for geese and seaduck species (Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Pettersson 2005 Krijgsveld et al. 2011 Plonczkier  Simms 2012 Vanermen  Stienen, Chapter 8), but seemingly higher for herons, ducks (other than seaduck), waders and songbirds (Krijgsveld et al. 2011 Krijgsveld et al. personal communication). When entering a wind farm, seaduck and geese, and presumably other species too, seem to reduce their risk of collision by adjusting their flight paths and flying in the corridors between the turbines (Desholm  Kahlert 2005 Petersen et al. 2006), or by increasing their flight altitude (Pettersson 2005 Plonczkier  Simms 2012).;Extrapolating from their radar observations at a Dutch OWF, Fijn et al. (2015) calculated that annually about 1.6 million birds passed through the rotorswept zone (25115 m above sea level) of
