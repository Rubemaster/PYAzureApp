Despite the distance from the mainland, the intensity of bat migration over the sea seems to be highly dependent on low or moderate wind speeds (Cryan  Brown 2007 Ahln et al. 2009 Lagerveld et al. 2014 Hppop  Hill 2016 Peterson et al. 2016). Dense cloud cover seems to be an important predictor of bat occurrence offshore, such as at a remote island (Cryan  Brown 2007) or an isolated offshore platform (Hppop  Hill 2016). The influence of precipitation, fog, and air pressure on bat occurrence at sea is somewhat unclear or at least site specific. Departures of radiotagged migratory tree bats close to Lake Erie were more likely to occur on nights with higher barometric pressure, lower winddifferential (difference between wind gust and sustained wind speed) and a higher dew point (Hatch 2015). Whereas lack of precipitation and high ambient pressure reliably predicted the occurrence of bats at two wind farms approximately 1523 km off the Dutch coast (Lagerveld et al. 2014), low stratus andor low barometric pressure determined bat occurrence farther offshore (Cryan  Brown 2007 Hppop  Hill 2016). Figure 7.4 summarises environmental factors of influence on offshore bat as well as bird migration.;Because of methodological constraints (see Molis et al., Chapter 5, Volume 4 of this series), it is difficult to estimate the number of bats crossing the sea or entering an OWF (Lagerveld et al. 2014 Hppop  Hill 2016). Based on literature data on anecdotal observations and direct ultrasonic detections at the islands of Borkum and Helgoland, Skiba (2007) suggested that approximately 5,300 bats, mainly Nathusius Pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii, could cross the German Bight each autumn, but also conceded that this number could be vastly underestimated.;Compared to birds, knowledge on flight altitudes of migrating bats is more limited, and even more so over open water. This is again due to technical and logistical constraints, since the equipment used for recording bats depends mainly on the species specific sound pressure of echolocation calls and environmental conditions, and only covers distances up to 100 m under the best conditions, and more typically 30 m or less (Ahln et al. 2009 Hppop  Hill 2016 Peterson et al. 2016 Molis et al., Volume 4, Chapter 5). Ahln et al. (2009) studied migrating and foraging bats over the Baltic Sea by direct observation, radar, thermal imaging, and acoustic recording. All migrating bats observed from the vessel flew at relatively low altitudes. Even some of the normally higher flying Common Noctules Nyctalus noctula flew lower than 10 m above the sea surface, although most of them flew higher.;Offshore, bats presumably use supporting tailwinds (Hatch et al. 2013 Smith  McWilliams 2016) on a larger scale and correspondingly many may fly much higher, and thus beyond the detection range of all recording equipment, as suggested by Hppop and Hill (2016) for species in the southern North Sea and Hatch et al. (2013) for Eastern Red Bats off the North American east coast,
