(1999), the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and ECON Ltd. Accurate counts are generally prevented by the inability to land and infrequency of visits.;In the summer of 2004, the main bank was seen to be emergent at all states of tide, coincident with the presence of a subsidiary sandbar within the Scroby Sands wind farm observed on aerial images used to determine seal haulout patterns (Skeate et al. 2012) and by workers undertaking bird surveys, especially tracking of Little Terns (Perrow et al. 2006 2015) (Figure 10.12). The wind farm had been constructed a few months earlier from November 2003 to February 2004.
