There is no doubt that fish respond to the noise emitted by piling activity, and how the fish respond during OWF construction will depend on how far away they are from the noise source and for how long they are exposed (Figure 5.2) (Gill et al. 2012a). As sound propagates through seawater it loses energy this happens more quickly in the higher frequencies but the low frequencies can still be detected tens of kilometres away. Hence, the effect of the noise upon fish is expected to be associated with the distance at which they received the sound, with injury occurring close to the noise source and behavioural response at a distance from it (Figure 5.2). The type of species will also determine how the noise is received,with species such as Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus, which are highly sensitive, detecting the pressure element of sound through an anatomical link between their swim bladders and their hearing apparatus (Popper 2000). In contrast, most species detect sound through particle motion (Hawkins  Popper 2016). Understanding of particle motion is poor, but acknowledging its importance highlights that researchers should not just concentrate on a few sensitive species, but consider OWF noise as a major factor in potentially influencing many different fish species and different life stages, thereby affecting assemblage attributes through time (Slabberkorn et al. 2010 Hawkins  Popper 2016). There is also a need to consider the extended exposure of fish during the several decades of the OWFs operational phase, during which they will experience lower levels of noise but over a much longer period. If these noises are above ambient they may cause interference with daily functioning and perhaps cause effects over the longer term (Slabbekorn et al. 2010), although whether this has any biologically significant impact is undetermined (Hawkins  Popper 2016).
