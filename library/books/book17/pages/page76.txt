As scour depths are controlled by a combination of structure size and shape, wave and tidal conditions and erodibility of localsediments, swath bathymetry surveys of the scour pits are often commonly included in UK licence conditions for OWFs. These show a wide range of scour depths from virtually nil, where combined wave and tidal bed shear stresses are insufficient to mobilise the local substrate or where scour protection has been prelaid to mitigate any changes in morphology, to over 5 m in areas where the potential for erosion is high and changes to metocean conditions can be significant. For instance, swath bathymetry surveys at the Scroby Sands OWF confirmed predictions made during the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) that the scour pits around individual monopile foundations would develop to 5 m depth and 100 m diameter (DECC  Defra 2008). A 5 m diameter monopile similar to that built at Scroby and without scour protection would only have a 20 m2 footprint on the seabed. However, with scour to the scale seen at Scroby producing scour pits up to 100 m diameter, approximately 7,850 m2 of seabed would be affected (Figure 2.4). It should be noted that Scroby Sands represents an extreme case and for most OWF sites the scale of scour effects will be much lower. In contrast, a 16 m diameter gravitybase foundation without scour protection will have a 200 m2 footprint on the seabed, although the associated ground preparations would cover an area of approximately 1,800 m2 for the gravel and filter layer and 4,000 m2 for the armour and backfill (Figure 2.4).
