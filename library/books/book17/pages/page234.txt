During operation, noise is generated by maintenance activities and by the turbines themselves. Machinery noise is the main contributor to underwater noise, with vibrations transmitted from the nacelle to the foundations, where they are radiated to the seabed and water. In contrast, airborne noise is almost completely reflected from the water surface. Turbinerelated noise depends on the foundation type as well as on the size and type of turbine, but little information has been published on this so far.;Tougaard et al. (2009b) made recordings of underwater wind turbine noise (100 Hz to 150 kHz) at between 14 and 40 m from foundations at three wind farms (Middelgrunden and Vindeby in Denmark and BockstigenValar in Sweden) with turbines ranging between 450 kW and 2 MW. They found that absolute noise levels were low 109127 dB re 1 Pa (rms) for the range of sounds produced up to a frequency of 20 kHz. The noise produced was of low intensity and frequency and was thought to be audible to Harbour Seals at distances up to a few kilometres, but only to 14 40 m from the bases for Harbour Porpoises. There was very limited capability for such noise to mask signals, let alone injure the animals (Box 6.2). Similarly, in a study using simulated windturbine noise, Lucke et al. (2007) suggested that the potential masking effects for Harbour Porpoise would be limited to short range in the open sea.;The operational noise immission from modern larger turbines also does not exceed ambient noise by much (20 dB re 1 Pa at 12 ms windspeed) (Norro  Degraer 2016). A modelling exercise indicated that operational noise may be audible to marine mammals, especially those with good hearing abilities at lower frequencies, such as Common Minke Whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata, over considerable distances of up to 20 km (Marmo 2013). However, there is no indication so far that this would lead to disturbance.
