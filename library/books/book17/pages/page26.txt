Since the early days of offshore wind, when 0.45 MW turbines were installed at Vindeby OWF, offshore turbines have become much larger than their onshore counterparts. Two factors have driven the increase in size the first being the availability of space offshore and the reduced need to consider other structures that make planning challenging, and the second being a significantly more favourable wind resource. However, the offshore environment brings additional complexities for wind turbines, including the need to manage saltwater corrosion and access difficulties associated with operations and maintenance (OM) activities when exposed to the harsh conditions offshore. Many newly consented projects are proposing turbines of 8 MWplus with blades measuring over 80 m in length, rotor diameters measuring up to 180 m and tip heights rapidly approaching 200 m (Figure 1.4). However, even as the first 8 MW turbines were being installed (for example at Burbo Bank Extension, near Liverpool, UK, in 2016), turbine designers were already planning machines capable of generating 1015 MW and above.
