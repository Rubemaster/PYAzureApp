Little research has considered both spatial variation and temporal change, although the acoustic tracking study on Atlantic Cod by Reubens et al. (2014a) provides an intriguing insight intothis topic (Box 5.1). Over a period of months, individual fish were found to be resident around particular turbines before they migrated away from the wind turbines to a nearby estuary in the winter (Reubens et al. 2014a). While the study was limited to a single year, the residency and distributional change by season is consistent with other Atlantic Cod movements recorded in the southern North Sea (Righton et al. 2007). Whether other species move between the offshore wind turbine habitat and other habitats is unknown, and whether the association with OWFs will have an influence on the population distribution of species is a fascinating area for future study. Moreover, with earlier life stages of fish being attracted to windturbine towers and foundations, there is further potential for alteration in the spatial distribution of fish populations.;In 2008, the construction of the CPower offshore wind farm, the first in the Belgian part of the North Sea, was started. The first phase consisted of six 5 MW turbines with a gravitybase foundation. In a later phase, 48 6.15 MW turbines on jacket foundations were added and the wind farm became fully operational in 2013. The wind farm is situated on the Thorntonbank, a natural sandbank 27 km offshore, with water depths ranging between 18 and 24 m. The gravitybase foundations are surrounded by a scour protection layer with an average diameter of 45 m, comprised of pebbles and rocks (Reubens et al. 2014a).
