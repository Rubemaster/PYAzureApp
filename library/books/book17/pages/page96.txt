The wind farm spans an area of 4 km2, or as big as 500 football fields, and comprises 12 5 MW wind turbines with two different foundation designs (Figure 3.2). Six wind turbines stand on jacket foundations installed after the supporting piles were driven into the seabed, whereas the other six turbines stand on tripod foundations with piles that were rammed into the sea floor after the tripods were placed on the seabed. These piles reach a depth of 35 m in the sea floor.;Figure 3.2 Panoramic view of the Alpha Ventus wind farm showing nine of the 12 turbines using two different turbine foundations. ( DOTI 2010Alpha Ventus Matthias Ibeler);Four selected turbines were equipped with more than 1,200 sensors to collect environmental and technical data. The research focuses on load analysis, safety and logistic questions, construction and operational noise measurements, modelling of sound propagation, fatigue originators and environmental research including meteorological, ecological, geological and oceanographic questions. The Federal Maritime  Hydrographic Agency (BSH) collects the oceanographic and geological data and coordinates the measurements of the different scientific subprojects of the RAVE initiative. The research platform FINO1 is in close proximity to Alpha Ventus and has collected environmental data for about 10 years.
