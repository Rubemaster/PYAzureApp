Figure 6.6 Response of Harbour Porpoise Phocoena phocoena to pile driving of 40 tripod foundations at the Trianel Borkum wind farm in the German North Sea (Diederichs et al. 2014). The values give the change in porpoise detections as porpoise positive minutes (PPM), which is minutes including at least one recording of a harbour porpoise click train. Noise levels are measured in sound classes of SEL50, which is median sound exposure level in decibels of a given number of pulsed sounds such as hammer blows.;In a further study, Brandt et al. (2018) investigated the response of Harbour Porpoises to pile driving during the construction of seven OWFs in the German Bight of the North Sea. All projects applied noisemitigation measures (see Concluding remarks below for details in Germany) but as these were still under development noise reduction was moderate. Nonparametric analyses revealed a clear gradient in the decline in porpoise detections at different noiselevel classes. Compared to a baseline period of 2548 hours before piling, porpoise detections declined by over 90 at noise levels above 170 dB, but only by about 25 at noise levels between 145 and 150 dB. Below 145 dB, this decline was smaller than 20 and thus was not clearly related to noise emitted by the piling process. The duration of the effect after piling was about 2031 hours in the close vicinity of the construction site (up to 2 km) and decreased with increasing distance. Projectspecific estimates ranged between 16 and 46
