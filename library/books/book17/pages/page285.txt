Extrapolating from their radar observations at a Dutch OWF, Fijn et al. (2015) calculated that annually about 1.6 million birds passed through the rotorswept zone (25115 m above sea level) ofthe entire wind farm area of about 27 km2. During the night, generally fewer birds were recorded in the rotorswept zone, mainly owing to the greater proportion of normally highflying night migrating songbirds (Blew et al. 2008 Krijgsveld et al. 2011 Fijn et al. 2015).;Depending on the prevailing conditions, this general pattern can, however, vary considerably (Blew et al. 2008 Hill et al. 2014b Schulz et al. 2014). With increasing wind speeds, for example, the proportion of mediumsized passerine birds at rotor height can increase as well (Krijgsveld et al. 2011). During daylight conditions, Blew et al. (2008) found about 10 to more than 30 of individually tracked songbirds, mainly pipits, wagtails, finches and Common Starlings Sturnus vulgaris reacting to the turbines. Actively rotating turbines also seem to provoke strong avoidance reactions in passing birds during the night (Schulz et al. 2014). At the Alpha Ventus test site in the German North Sea, the proportion of birds flying close to the turbines at rotor height was 13.630 times higher when the turbine blades were standing still than when they were turning (Schulz et al. 2014). Furthermore, during two consecutive nights of heavy songbird mass migration through the wind farm at altitudes below 200 m above sea level, significantly more birds were recorded near turbines and at rotor height during the night with nonoperating turbines (Schulz et al. 2014). Likewise, in a Dutch wind farm, avoidance of individual turbines by local and migrating seabirds and nonmarine birds, e.g., thrushes and geese, was higher at night when turbine blades were rotating (Krijgsveld et al. 2011).;The overall avoidance behaviour of nightmigrating passerines to OWFs is presently unknown. We assume that in general barrier effects and thus effects on flight energetics may be neglected for passerines. The situation may, however, become quite different in poor weather, i.e., fog, drizzle, or rain, when birds could be attracted and disoriented by the lights of (static) offshore structures (Hill et al. 2014b Schulz et al. 2014). Birds can get trapped for hours, showing continuous disoriented flight around the lighted structure (Ballasus et al. 2009 Hope Jones 1980 Larkin  Frase 1988 Gauthreaux  Belser 2006), and may die from exhaustion or collision (Hppop et al. 2016).
