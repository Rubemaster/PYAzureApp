Table 9.2 Impact of wind turbines at Zeebrugge on the breedingpopulations of terns in Flanders, Belgium.;The new turbines were installed in early 2009, as shown by the black line. In the period from 2009 to 2014, a Red Fox Vulpes vulpes was present on the peninsula, with implications of predation and removal of collided terns The shaded parts of the table indicate estimated mean annual mortality effects 1 of the regional population as calculated from known mortality rates in northwestern Europe.;The new turbines were installed in early 2009, as shown by the black line.

The reason for this repowering was twofold (1) to achieve higher electricity production and (2) to reduce tern collision fatalities, because most terns fly at relatively low altitude when crossing the breakwater. This winwin situation was one of the conservation objectives in this Natura 2000 site.;However, in the period 20092014, the colony was significantly disturbed by the presence of a Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and Brown Rats Rattus norvegicus, resulting in a large decrease in the number of breeding pairs and decreased reproductive output. This made it difficult to make a reliable comparison with previous years and to separate the effect of the repowering from disturbance and predation. Nonetheless, compared with the period before 2009, a clear reduction in the number of collision fatalities, both absolute and proportional to the number of breeding pairs, was noted (Table 9.2). However,
