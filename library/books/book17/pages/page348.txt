Offshore displacement studies showed quite good consistency in results, yet there still are obvious differences between sites. First of all, local factors such as food abundance, the location of the OWF relative to the colony or feeding grounds, and windfarm configuration may be very important in explaining the observed response. When resources become limited, individuals may be prepared to take more risks or be more tolerant of the presence of wind farms (Htker 2017). Therefore, displacement responses are likely to depend on the food availability in and outside OWFs, either within the foraging range from breeding colonies or in wintering areas.;In relation to windfarm characteristics, all studies so far have investigated single and relatively small wind farms with fewer than 100 turbines, and how seabirds will respond towards much bigger clusters of turbines is still to be investigated. One can also easily imagine that wind farms with closely spaced turbines would provoke a stronger avoidance response, as argued by Leopold et al. (2013). In this study, the authors found Common Guillemot to be avoiding the PAWP more than the nearby OWEZ wind farm and suggested that the former, with its much higher turbine density (4.3 versus 1.3 turbines per km2), was less permeable to movement. Combining and analysing postconstruction results from different sites may eventually lead to reliable statements on this matter.;Depending on the season, birds also may react differently towards wind farms. Migrating Common Eiders have been shown to change flight direction at distances of 12 km at Kalmar Sound, Sweden (Pettersson 2005), or 35 km at Nysted, Denmark (Petersen et al. 2006), while flying birds commuting between roosting and feeding grounds showed a strong behavioural response towards the Tun Knob turbines (Larsen  Guillemette 2007).
