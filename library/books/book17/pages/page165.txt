The life stages that are most vulnerable to change are those where resource limitation is the main controlling factor, examples being extent of refuge habitat, food availability and spawning habitat. Species that have reproductive behaviour that causes adults to congregate in a single area will increase the potential overlap and hence the likely significance of effects. Those species that have a high dependency on benthic sources of food may experience changes to the type and abundance of prey items (see Dannheim et al., Chapter 4). Species with eggs that drift with the prevailing currents may also increase their chances of encountering OWFs downstream.;One particular attribute that a number of species of fish have is their propensity to undertake significant movements that have direct consequences for the species distribution. These may be shortterm but regular movements, for example to and from feeding grounds, or they may be longer term, seasonal movements whereby some life stages undertake significant migrations across large distances, such as European Eel Anguilla anguilla moving over thousands of kilometres during both the larval stage, on their way to rivers, and the adult reproductive phase, when returning to central spawning grounds (van Ginneken  Maes 2005). Such movements will have consequences for the local and regional distribution, species abundance and community composition. Changes could also occur if movement routes are impeded or if local habitats are altered such that the migratory fish cannot move around normally that is, the connectivity of functional habitats is blocked.
