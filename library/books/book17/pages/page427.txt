It is of note that while noise mitigation systems are routinely applied in Germany, they are not in the UK, where rampup procedures are used to encourage animals to disperse away from the construction area. Relatively few sites have also included specific monitoring of the response of marine mammals (MMO 2014). Results from Sheringham Shoal may be indicative of a general pattern, however. Here, boatbased surveys were conducted over 9 years, with 3 years of data before, during and after construction. This enabled a comparison of relative densities of animals incorporating distancesampling corrections where possible, in the wind farm and 02 km buffer. Only data from the summer months, when most of the construction was undertaken and surveyintensity was the highest, were included. Although the comparison was crude in that surveys were not tied to specific shortduration piling events, trends were still apparent as Harbour Porpoises declined during the general piling period relative to prepiling (Figure 10.1). Partial recovery occurred thereafter, in the sense that numbers of sightings were still lower, albeit not significantly so, during the operational period compared to preconstruction. This is in line with Teilmann and Carstensen (2012), who noted that Harbour Porpoise populations had not fully recovered some 10 years after the construction of the Nysted wind farm in Denmark. Some change in the resource base in and around the wind farm for Harbour Porpoises is implied, perhaps linked to changes in the fish community according to the reef effect (see Colonisation and attraction, below) that do not favour the species preferred by porpoises
