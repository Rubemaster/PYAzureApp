Figure 5.10 Detection intensities of tagged Atlantic Cod (13 individuals) around two turbines from CPower in 2011, showing a preference for the hardsubstrate associated areas in close proximity to the turbines.;Atlantic Cod are known to make extensive migrations between feeding (in summer and autumn) and spawning grounds (in winter), but during the feeding season they may largely reduce their foraging movements, sometimes to less than 1 km (Turner et al. 2002). This is consistent with the results of the current study. Reubens et al. (2014b) revealed that Atlantic Cod use the artificial hard structures of the wind turbines as feeding grounds in summer. During winter, the fish probably migrate towards spawning grounds andor overwintering habitats. Unpublished ongoing research and recaptures by recreational fishers revealed that some of the individuals tagged at the wind farms moved to the Western Scheldt coastal area and estuary in the Netherlands. The specific reason why they moved to this area remains unresolved.
