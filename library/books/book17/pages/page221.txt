Figure 6.4 Underwater sound pressure impulse of a piledriving blow, recorded at a distance of approximately 400 m. The peak level in this example is 20 log(2,400106) dB187.6 dB, whereas the peaktopeak level is 20 log((2,4002,290)106) dB193.4 dB. SEL sound exposure level. (Nehls  Bellmann 2016);Peak sound pressure (ppeak), often expressed as peak level (Lpeak)20 log(ppeakp0), where ppeakmax p(t) that is, the highest absolute sound pressure observed. Some authors, however, prefer a peaktopeak level (Matuschek  Betke 2009).;Piledriving noise is made up of rather low frequencies, with the main energy below 100 Hz. At higher frequencies that are more audible to marine mammals, noise levels are low and fall below background levels at rather short distance.;Noise levels from pile driving depend on various factors, the most important being piling energy, pile diameter and water depth. Pile diameter and water depth define the surface emitting noise into the water column. As piling energy is related to pile diameter (larger piles need higher energy), pile diameter is a good predictor of actual noise immission. As piling energy may be kept low to reduce noise immission, there is some variability between projects, although a clear positive relationship between pile diameter and noise levels is apparent but the increase in noise levels off for large piles (Figure 6.5).
