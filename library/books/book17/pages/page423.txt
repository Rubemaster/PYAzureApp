This final chapter in Volume 3 attempts to synthesise the findings of the preceding chapters that describe effects and impacts (Box 10.1) in order to provide a platform for Volume 4, which describes the monitoring tools available and outlines the means of mitigating the most likely impacts. This synthesis fundamentally relies on the material presented and conclusions reached by the expert authors of the chapters although some attempt is also made to explore the ramifications of important points as well as the nature of any effects and impacts described. The latter includes both where effects and impacts have been shown and therefore realised , but also where they have the potential to occur from a consideration of ecological principles. Moreover, whereas the authors have generally utilised peerreviewed contributions as the gold standard for veracity (Lovich  Ennen 2017), this chapter also uses supporting information from the grey literature in reports or websites. It is important to state that this chapter is a personal perspective and while I have faithfully tried to represent the findings of the respective authors, my interpretation of the information they provide may differ, and readers are encouraged to also refer to theoriginal work.;The intended scope of all chapters in this volume was global, but information was invariably heavily biased towards experiences in the North and Baltic Seas in northwest Europe as the current epicentre of the industry. The intention was to learn from these experiences so they could be applied, or where necessary the standard of research and monitoring could be improved, within those rapidly emerging markets in Asia, including China, Japan and Taiwan in the USA and in southern Europe, including France, Portugal and Spain among others. The different species and marine communities in other parts of the world, especially those in warm waters with different trophic dynamics and structure and function, may demand a different focus and approach for investigation of effects and impacts.;To help structure the Themes of this chapter, the information provided in each chapter on the six groups considered in this volume, namely seabed communities, fish, marine mammals, bats, migratory nonseabirds and seabirds, was summarised according to the evidence for effects and impacts (Table 10.1). As in the equivalent chapter in the onshore Volume 1 (Perrow 2017), the Themes classified the main effects across faunal groups under the following headings Disturbance and displacement, Colonisation and attraction, and Collision with turbines. In addition, it was important to consider Foodweb and indirect effects under a specific heading, because these invariably occur to a greater or lesser extent as
