Figure 7.3 shows two examples of bird species composition recorded with different techniques from offshore platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico, with varying distances to the nearest shore of 8204 km and water depths of approximately 11535 m, and in the German North Sea at about 45 km from the coast and a water depth of almost 30 m (FINO 1). Daytime observations revealed that waterfowl and wading birds comprise about half to fourfifths of the birds recorded offshore (Figure 7.3a, (c). The higher proportion of songbirds observed at the northern Gulf of Mexico platforms compared to their proportion at FINO 1 is partly due to the additional recording of birds using the platform for stopover (Russell 2005). With acoustic registrations at night, the pattern was seemingly different, with about 7685 of the recorded birds being passerines (Figure 7.3b, (d). This apparent discrepancy can, to some extent, be explained by the recording techniques. A noticeable difference between the flightcall recordings at the two locations may be the lack of gulls and terns at the platform in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Figure 7.3b). The two examples in Figure 7.3, however, illustrate, on the one hand, what one would expect toencounter offshore, namely seabirds and waterbirds. On the other hand, passerines and other mainly terrestrial birds are more frequently encountered offshore during their nocturnal migration than one might assume.;Wind speed and direction are important factors in bird flight speeds and energetics. To save time and energy during migration, birds are expected to select time periods and flight altitudes with favourable wind conditions, which means tailwinds or at least winds of low speed. Indeed, migrants adjust their flight altitude accordingly (Liechti 2006 Schmaljohann et al. 2009 Kahlert et al. 2012 Kemp et al. 2013). Likewise, diurnal migrants at the Strait of Messina in the Mediterranean selected the first optimal wind layer they encountered when climbing, even when better winds occurred at higher altitudes (MateosRodriguez  Liechti 2012).;Flight altitudes of birds often exceed 4,000 m (Bruderer 1997 Alerstam  Gudmundsson 1999 Liechti 2006). Longranging radar detected bird migration off the coasts of North and South America at considerable altitudes, up to 4,000 m (Williams  Williams 1990). In contrast, more than onethird of the birds recorded offshore in the North Sea were flying in the lowest 200 m above sea level as determined by modified marine radar (Hppop et al. 2004 2006 Fijn et al. 2015). Since the radar signal from the lowest flying birds was not distinguishable from reflections of the water surface, the number of lowflying birds was most likely to be underestimated. In contrast, very highflying individuals were likely underdetected because they were too far away from the radar (Hppop et al. 2006). Visual observations revealed that considerable numbers of diurnally migrating bird species or species groups, such as waterfowl, waders, or songbirds, often fly at very low altitudes over the sea (Krger  Garthe 2001 Dierschke  Daniels 2003 Hppop et al. 2004 2006 Kahlert et al. 2012) (Figure 7.2). The low flight altitudes of swans and geese over the sea observed visually have been confirmed by Global Positioning System (GPS) altitude data (Griffin et al. 2011). Radar observations along the Dutch coast revealed that waders starting to fly close to the shoreline at relatively low altitudes of 5135 m during the day continue to do so during the night and at greater distances from the coast (Dirksen et al. 1996).
