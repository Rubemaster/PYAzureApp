Windfarm structures are colonisation sites for epibenthic, sessile and hardsubstratum species, and if any such species are introduced to the area then they will find an available niche. Given that there is already a plethora of equivalent structures such as shipwrecks and rock outcrops, it will not be possible to prove that wind farms will exacerbate the transfer of nonindigenous species. However, this is conceivable, albeit as yet unproven for the unique intertidal habitat in clear offshore water provided by wind farms
