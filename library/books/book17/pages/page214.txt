Windfarm related processes that may affect marine mammals include seismic surveys to determine geological conditions installation of foundations, particularly through noisy pile driving increased vessel activity during surveys and construction, leading to disturbance and even possible collision suspension of sediments and disturbance of the seabed, including through cable laying release of pollutants and decommissioning (Figure 6.2). The presence of turbines will also be associated with other pressures, such as noise and vibration and changed local hydrodynamics, but with the benefit of providing artificial reefs and sanctuary from fishing activity, both leading to the accumulation of potential prey (Figure 6.2). This suite of negative and positive effects form the basis of the Themes presented below, with the exclusion of disturbance of the seabed, which is generally assumed to be short term, and the release of pollutants, which has only rarely been documented (see Rees  Judd, Chapter 2) and with no demonstrable effect upon marine mammals. Nor does this review specifically consider other potential effects, such as electromagnetic fields from cables, scourprotection, active and passive corrosion protection of the foundations, lighting of turbines and sonar transponders as navigational aids for submarines. All such factors are so far considered to cause no more than a negligible, if any, effect on marine mammals, but rather contribute to a changing environment in areas where OWFs are built.;Figure 6.2 Range of effects that may influence marine mammals during the life of a wind farm.;The effects associated with windfarm construction and decommissioning are thought to be numerous but short lived, while those associated with operation and maintenance are less variable but longer lived over the 25 years or more of the project. The Themes generally document effects sequentially throughout the lifetime of the project, although there is little information regarding the effects of decommissioning or repowering wind farms as only a few of the first wind farms, including Yttre Stengrund Wind Farm in Sweden (2015), Lely Wind Farm in the Netherlands (2016) and Vindeby in Denmark (2017), have been decommissioned (Topham  McMillan 2017).
