Model simulations under representative conditions have shown that resulting changes in the surface elevation are in order of 0.01 m. Associated with this, vertical cells with an averagehorizontal dimension of 1530 km are created, with maximum vertical velocities of 3.5 mday, leading to an excursion of the pycnocline of about 10 m (Ludewig 2015).;The VWFS Wega measuring campaign at Alpha Ventus described above (see Empirical evidence of upwelling, Figure 3.3) allowed the measurement of temperature and salinity profiles to detect any OWFinduced upwelling and downwelling zones affecting the depth of the thermocline. Figure 3.4 shows the four sections (transects) of interest around the 12turbine wind farm, with a length varying between 10.9 and 12.8 km and a distance between 5.5 and 6.4 km from the centre of the OWF. This analysis focuses on the temperature as this showed the clearest signal. Along these sections, Figure 3.7 contrasts the measured temperature profiles with the corresponding simulated profiles for the observed and simulated southwesterly wind conditions. The modelled and observed vertical temperature structures, accentuated by the black solid and dashed lines, show remarkably good agreement. In particular, the locations of simulated upwelling and downwelling zones downwind of the wind farm, that is on the northern and eastern sections, were also detected under real conditions. This substantiates the conclusions from previous theoretical and numerical considerations. However, there are also clear differences between the observations and model results, in particular on the upwind side, which can be explained by the partly idealised model setup comprising constant topography and a constant wind field.
