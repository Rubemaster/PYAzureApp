Figure 5.12 Annual total production (a) annual production values are scaled to per square metre of habitat for natural reefs (n56), platform habitat subtypes including base (n111) and midwater (n132) (b) annual production values are scaled to per square metre of seafloor for natural reefs (n56) and complete platforms (n111). Circles indicate individual data points and are jittered for visibility. Horizontal lines show the backtransformed estimated marginal means. The shaded box represents the 95 confidence intervals (CIs) of the mean. Differences were considered significant if the 95 CIs of their marginal means did not overlap. (Reproduced from Claisse et al. 2014 with permission);Claisse et al. (2014) show that the complex hard substrate created by oil and gas platforms provides habitat for fish throughout the water column, leading to the highest estimate of secondary production per unit area of seabed of any comparable marine ecosystem studied so far. While oil and gas platforms are similar to offshore wind farms in terms of creating a hard, complex substrate, there is a difference in
