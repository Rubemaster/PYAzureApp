Different foundation options are available for turbines within offshore wind farms (OWFs). The most common foundation to date is the monopile, but other types include tripods and lattice structures, gravity basescaissons and floating structures (see Figure 1.6 in Jameson et al., Chapter 1).;In more detail, a monopile foundation consists of a large diameter cylindrical steel tube (typical pile diameter 46.5 m) with a transition piece connecting the pile to the turbine tower (Figure 2.1a). Depending on the soil characteristics, monopiles are predominantly driven into the seabed and are suitable for shallow water up to 2535 m deep relative to mean sea level (MSL). Some sites will also require drilling to enable the monopile to reach the design penetration depth (typically 20 30 m). They can be installed in deeper water, but that increases the cost of deployment. A 5 m diameter monopile without scour protection will have a 20 m2 footprint on the seabed. An existing variant of monopile foundations for deep water is guyed monopile towers, allowing the monopile to be stabilised with tensioned guy wires (Malhotra 2011). Potential impacts include scour pits, scour wakes and sediment disturbance from constructional activity, including ploughing, jetting for cables and spudcan seabed indentations due to jackup vessels.;Tripod, jacket or lattice foundations sit on the seabed anchored by smaller pin piles up to 2 m in diameter, with shallower sinking depths than monopiles (Figure 2.1b). Potential impacts are similar to monopiles but reduced, as the size of the individual members of the structure is correspondingly smaller.
