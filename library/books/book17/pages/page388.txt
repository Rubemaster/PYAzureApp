Figure 9.6 A number of species within several common groups of seabirds, including petrels, shearwaters and this group of alcid auks comprising Razorbills Alca torda and Common Guillemots Uria aalge in winter plumage, typically fly close to the sea surface and rarely reach the rotorswept zone. As such, they are at little risk of collision with turbine blades. (Martin Perrow);While such data are a useful way of standardising impact assessments across wind farms at the planning stage, generic data collected preconstruction may not accurately reflect bird behaviour within constructed wind farms. In addition, seabirds may exhibit different flight behaviours at different sites, meaning that generic data may either underestimate or overestimate collision.;For example, flight height is also known to vary according to whether the bird is commuting or foraging (Cleasby et al. 2015a) and may also be inconsistent between species. Similarly, although foraging strategies which include aerial searching and pursuit have been shown to be significant predictors of collision at onshore wind farms (Hull et al. 2013) and may be the case for Northern Gannet, where foraging birds had a greater median flight height than commuting birds (Cleasby et al. 2015a), by contrast, Global Positioning System (GPS)tagged Lesser Blackbacked Gulls flew lower on more tortuous, potentially foraging flights than when in
