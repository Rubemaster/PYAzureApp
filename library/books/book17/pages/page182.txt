To assess the impacts of the wind turbines on the presence and movement behaviour of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua, an acoustic telemetry study was initiated. Acoustic telemetryallows the study of individual behaviour of undisturbed fish for a long period (Voegeli et al. 2001). This technique requires the use of two types of instruments transmitters and receivers. Fish are tagged with a transmitter, which sends out an acoustic signal on a predefined delay. The receivers are deployed on the ocean floor and continuously monitor the presence of acoustic transmitters in their detection range. In this study, six receivers (type Vemco VR2W) were deployed around two turbines and 22 individual fish were tagged with V9 acoustic transmitters (Vemco Ltd) at those turbines (Figure 5.8). The study ran between May 2011 and July 2012. Further details on tagging and tracking procedures are provided in Reubens et al. (2013b). Here, the focus is on the results for the gravitybase foundations.
