Figure 10.12 Development of Scroby Sands as a time series beforewindfarm construction in 1999 (top left) and 2003 (top right), in 2004 immediately following windfarm construction (middle left) and thereafter in 2007 (middle right), 2012 (bottom left) and 2018 (bottom right). Note that the bank was submerged at high water before 2003, but after 2004 was emergent at all states of the tide, excepting the potential for overtopping on the highest tides and in storm events. A subsidiary sandbar emerged in 2004, which coalesced with the main bank over time. The main bank also appears to have also migrated north, closer to the wind farm. The large increase in relative height of the bank is shown by the dryness of the sand by 2018, which persists even on the highest tides. (Mike Page aerial photography);The construction of the wind farm in a highly dynamic environment produced some of the largest scour pits around turbines yet recorded, at up to 5.8 m (1.38 times monopile diameter) deep and up to 100 m in diameter (Whitehouse et al. 2011 Rees  Judd, Chapter 2). Attempts were made to counteract scour with post hoc dumping of 900 m3 rock armour per foundation in 2004 and subsequently with the use of tyre filled nets around five foundations in 2015 (Offshore Wind 2016). While detailed geophysical investigation was undertaken within the wind farm (Rees  Judd, Chapter 2), the farfield effects of the mobilisation of fine materials and patterns of erosion and deposition were not studied. However, the presence of the sandbar in the wind farm (Figure 10.12) is consistent with the mobilisation of material derived from scour and what appears to be the main vector of sediment transport in a southerly direction towards the main Scroby Sands sandbank 23 km away.
