Information on seabird displacement was compiled based on the results of monitoring studies in 16 different European OWFs. As already mentioned in the Scope above, very different methodologies have been applied, making consistent interpretation difficult and somewhat subjective. When different reports or publications on the same OWF were available, only the one including most recent data and applying the most uptodate approach in terms of data processing and modelling was considered. In general, one key reference was considered per OWF, although in some cases different references were used for different species (Table 8.1). For example, at Robin Rigg OWF, Canning et al. (2013) report extensively on a range of species, while Vallejo et al. (2017) performed more advanced modelling on Common Guillemot in a further study. It should also be noted that not all species considered in the studies listed in Table 8.1 were included in this exercise. The preferred modelling strategy could not always be performed because of insufficient positive observations, and even if it was, the authors sometimes concluded that the results for certain species could beunreliable and should therefore be interpreted with care. Leopold et al. (2013), for instance, found the Prinses Amalia (PAWP) OWF to be largely out of the normal distribution range of divers, Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus and Common Scoter Melanitta nigra, which were therefore not included in this exercise despite the reported displacement estimates.;Table 8.1 List of offshore wind farms, their location, range of species assessed and key references included in this review.
